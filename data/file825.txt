8250036 the conference is an example that we are honoring one of the commitments we made at the time of the bid process for the plant when we said we would encourage our suppliers to consider ways of bringing business to romania either by using romanian suppliers for their own requirements or establishing facilities of their own in romania in support of our craiova operations
8250037 however we will not be announcing any additional craiova investments or employment actions
8250038 the supplier conference in craiova is part of our supplier engagement strategy and a next logical step in the planning and preparation of our production at the plant
8250039 in addition to us giving the suppliers an update on our craiova plans during the meeting they will be given details of local business opportunities ranging from identifying romanian companies capable of supplying them with goods or services through to what opportunities there are for establishing their own operations in romania

8250041 its costing me more for fuel now than insurance its gotten to be a lot more expensive
8250042 its been a pretty big increase its just like an additional tax
8250043 its really a perfect storm with the economy starting to slow and gas prices at an all time high
8250044 fuel is a major part of this business and when it goes up our members feel the pinch its not only the cost of gasoline to power the mowers and equipment its also the cost of diesel fuel for trucks to get to and from the job sites
8250045 our fuel costs have nearly doubled in the past six months and in addition our fertilizers and other chemicals we purchase have at least doubled were seeing real inflation here
8250046 its affecting our profits also because our operating costs have gone up weve had to increase our prices to maintain reasonable profit levels
8250047 in some of the western suburbs were seeing people are more price conscious and less inclined to purchase additional services
8250048 i think there will be a breaking point at some point
8250049 if gas prices go up to 6 7 or 8 a gallon at that point there will be a major problem i believe people can only afford so much

8250053 just when you see the most outlandish clip you could ever see somebody introduces something new i just check in periodically just to see how far porn has gone in my absence
8250054 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
8250055 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon

8250068 fire was not that big and it was put out in a couple of hours but the building was very old and the ceiling collapsed while they were sleeping
8250069 we have issued shoot at sight orders following large scale violence and rioting in some curfew bound areas of kandhamal district
8250070 had they taken effective steps the situation could have been controlled so far the situation is out of control this is a matter of concern for us
8250071 though tension prevails in kandhamal the situation is improving gradually in some areas security forces have been able to enter inaccessible areas by removing obstacles placed by miscreants
8250072 we have arrested tanveer pathan and jahir patel two locals who played a major role in helping those who had come from outside to plant bombs in the city
8250073 mufti abu bashir sajid mansuri yunus mansuri and samsuddin sheikh arrested for ahmedabad blasts were directly involved in planting bombs in surat they all are associated with simi
8250074 the output current of transistor used in bombs planted in the city was insufficient to detonate the explosives
8250075 when we set it right for experiment in our office they exploded
8250076 interrogation is going on and we cannot give further details at this stage
8250077 outsiders with the help of these locals planted the bombs in surat tanveer played a major role by showing the locations where the bombs can be planted but final selection of locations was done by those who had come from outside
8250078 it is clear that active simi members who went underground after the outfit was banned by the centre in 2001 were involved in ahmedabad blasts and planting bombs in surat
8250079 some local modules were also involved we are trying to get more details
8250080 hard work by gujarat police with the help of police from other states has helped in solving the cases rajasthan police had recently arrested one person from uttar pradesh on the basis of information from those arrested in ahmedabad
8250081 one thing cannot be the motive behind the terror attacks it is part of their game plan to carry out such blasts from time to time in various parts of the country it has been done with absolute anti national feeling
8250082 please dont try to pick holes in the investigations at this stage we are ready to go to the court where we will give all answers it is not the time for media trial
8250083 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8250084 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8250085 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8250086 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8250087 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8250088 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8250089 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8250090 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8250091 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8250092 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8250093 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8250094 passengers travelling with young children should attend to their own mask first
8250095 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8250096 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8250097 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later
8250098 i was wondering why they dont just come out and call it a dll

8250145 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models
8250146 it is amazing that economists on the average cannot out forecast households
8250147 i think its partly because inflation is hard to forecast even the weather plays a part
8250148 i think some of these basic things that affect prices nobody can forecast households or professional economists
8250149 households are right there in the nitty gritty seeing what groceries are doing when they go to the store seeing what gas prices are doing

8250230 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8250231 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8250232 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8250233 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8250234 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone

8250236 going with the flow through atlanta at 85 mph so i pick my time to drive there
8250237 have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot and anyone going faster than you is a maniac
8250238 that was a pretty good waste of taxpayer dollars if you ask me
8250239 we intervene in the hardware stream and say how about a virtual network and that is starting to ramp up
8250240 we started to buy commercial suites like xensource now owned by citrix or vmware but we always hated their licensing programs and the way they tried to limit growth so we wound up back at xen org
8250241 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment
8250242 we were into coldfusion and j j allaire adopted linux early weve developed on top of linux ever since
8250243 i find myself always gravitating to the gnu type projects they are the best way to develop venture backed applications with the amount of creativity coming out of the community and the value right out of the box you realize a real benefit by always using foss
8250244 the other day i was looking around the office and realized we use a lot of linux applications
8250245 we didnt set out to build the company on linux but we wound up doing that because everything just fits we use
8250246 we still have to use exchange but were about to move over to an exchange knockoff with a great feature set called kerio
8250247 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
8250248 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
8250249 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
8250250 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense
8250251 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8250252 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8250253 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8250254 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8250255 be given the appropriate consideration by the commission and be duly referenced in its policy documents in particular wherever the commissions policy choices depart from our studies main recommendations
8250256 seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union in doing so the commission reinforces the suspicion already widely held by the public at large that its policies are less the product of a rational decision making process than of lobbying by stakeholders
8250257 the pricing challenges many oems experienced is a concern as it may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand as enterprise budgets face further scrutiny in the second half of 2008

8250264 after all the common fare of blogs which often have their own axes to grind and their own less than admirable motivations for publishing often does not meet the standards of a responsible news outlet what ought to be considered adequate sourcing for such a story
8250265 i was reading clarencegrad72 about whatever and it got me to thinking that i could expand on it with the vast resources at my disposal
8250266 a blog is defined by the hive mind over at
8250267 a website usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary descriptions of events or other material such as graphics or video entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order
8250268 a meandering blatantly uninteresting online diary that gives the author the illusion that people are interested in their stupid pathetic life consists of such riveting entries as homework sucks and i slept until noon today

8250283 he was just asking me what day it was and different things like that then he put his finger up and told me to follow it and i told him i dont want my brothers to see me doing this because theyll talk about me then he started laughing and he knew i was all right

8250304 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8250305 it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8250306 by suggesting wealth generating reforms primarily on matters of taxation regulation health care and education
8250307 water clearly is a resource that is essential to life and turning it into a business may arouse fears that it could one day be overexploited
8250308 but these fears can be calmed if a legal and regulatory framework is established regardless of the fuss it is not necessary to prohibit trade in water

8250315 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8250316 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8250317 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8250318 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8250319 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8250320 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8250321 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8250322 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8250323 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8250324 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8250325 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8250326 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8250327 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8250328 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8250329 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8250330 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8250331 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8250332 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8250333 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8250334 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8250335 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8250336 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8250337 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8250338 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8250339 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8250340 that one time i made that fat kid cry cause i threw it like right by his head three times and then threw three strikes in a row that was awesome
8250341 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8250342 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8250343 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8250344 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8250345 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8250346 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8250347 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8250348 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8250349 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8250350 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8250351 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8250352 who are open to doing something on the production side
8250353 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8250354 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8250355 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8250356 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8250357 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8250358 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8250359 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8250360 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8250361 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8250362 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8250363 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8250364 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8250365 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8250366 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8250367 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8250368 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8250369 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8250370 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8250371 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8250372 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8250373 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8250374 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8250375 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8250376 bidens bishop will not permit the senator even if elected vice president of the united states of america to speak at catholic schools
8250377 if only he struggled for another 4 months the story would have been different
8250378 why not try persistently and keep trying persistently till the time success is ashamed of hiding from you

8250381 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8250382 i was appalled when i found the bank account information that sort of thing shouldnt have been listed on there
8250383 it would have been possibly quite easy to find if you know something about computers
8250384 we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
8250385 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
8250386 this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8250387 we have not seen the listing ourselves but we do recommend people wipe hard discs before they sell computers
8250388 we would not allow someone to openly sell bank details on our site but this seems to have been a genuine mistake
8250389 suck it up there is nothing you can do about it
8250390 yet organisations rarely have adequate visibility or control of their data
8250391 the starting point is developing a robust security policy and ensuring that all employees fully understand their role and obligations in support of it through internal training and communication
8250392 we believe this is a trend setting insurance solution for homeowners who are interested in the many benefits of going green at home
8250393 our target market for homeowners is affluent and high net worth
8250394 we are not offering these policies at the present time but that doesnt mean that we wouldnt in the future
8250395 every little step helps and if you cant afford new windows or storm windows plastic film kits arent a bad alternative
8250396 we cant be doing the same thing the same old way
8250397 but what we need to do is try to remember two simple words whole foods
8250398 instead of buying prepared frozen twice baked potatoes buy a real live whole potato it costs a fraction of the price pennies per pound and it probably even tastes better
8250399 credit card companies will routinely raise your rates to see if they can get away with it so you have to be vigilant
8250400 keep a healthy cushion between what youre allowed to spend and what you actually spend
8250401 that could mean the difference between buying new back to school clothes or making do with last years wardrobe for some families
8250402 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency

8250408 it was one of my favorite bars in cambridge and taught me a lot about old fashioned cocktails

8250410 i think their food was always a little overpriced but i never went there to eat

8250479 when marco and mutoh got zero air during the infineon race broadcast we took that as the first warning sign we might be slipping into backmarkerland
8250480 i mean being in the zero air club with darrin manning townsend bell and tomas scheckter is a bit of a shock that and the fact that marco and hidekis cars didnt have the magic rings kind of raised a few red flags
8250481 we told firestone that marco is an andretti and as such should receive the rings because at any time the andretti family could get a rules change that put marco back in it but firestone didnt listen
8250482 when an andretti is not listened to in the league then its time to do some tests
8250483 the day danica gets zero air is the day the entire team goes to the hospital via medical helicopter
8250484 we can always have marco mutoh and danica spear each other or something we also havent ruled out having danica stomp down to marcos pit box or start yelling at jack arute on camera there are ways to get air that we havent had to try yet so were not too worried

8250503 and gentlemen if thy wanderings bring thee to vyones a welcome thou wilt find at my house it is not as grand or exotic as some thou mayest have seen but thou wouldst find an appreciative audience who knows the archbishop might also welcome entertainers such as thyselves
8250504 on thy many travels hast thou ever heard of a man who can assume the supernatural form of wolf
8250505 i do not sympathize with thy answer sir but tis well spoken and that is a great deal in itself we wilt take thee up on thy offer of hospitality if eer we come to vyones the presence at this time of the inquisition makes it less commodious than might otherwise be the case
8250506 as for the dreaded loup garou friend i suggest that thou stayest as far away from it as possible from the determined look in thy eyes i fear that will not be far enough

8250567 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8250568 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8250569 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8250570 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8250571 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood
8250572 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8250573 we will see how this will develop we are sticking to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there strictly

8250583 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8250584 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8250585 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8250586 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8250587 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8250588 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8250589 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8250590 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties

8250592 i do not think you know who the fuck you are threatening at this moment with those statements at russia as miliband she will kill you directly milibad
8250593 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8250594 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
8250595 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8250596 this failure may just be one of many other setbacks encountered in the largely successful 60 year effort to reduce trade barriers around the world but set against the growing sense of protectionism in both the developed and the developing world this failure carries an ominous tone

8250622 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8250623 if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama we are going to have somebody who answers that phone
8250624 she has broke so many stereotypes changed the perception forever gotten rid of the notion that no longer a woman could be president that is over those days are gone

8250666 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
8250667 second quarter results were strong despite the current operating environment affecting global food manufacturers and distributors while consumers and manufacturers alike have acclimated to the global inflationary rise in food costs we do not believe that the cost of food will stabilize in the near future in light of this solid top line growth reflects the synergies found in bringing together a broad range of premium kosher products to our internal and external distribution channels we will continue to work on diversifying our product base expanding our distribution channels and maintaining control of our cost of sales
8250668 diversification strategy is working our top line growth is a reflection of the synergies we have created to channel the broad range of products coming from our own sourcing and that of our subsidiaries
8250669 we have been able to grow revenues and contain costs to an acceptable degree despite the immediate challenges pertaining to food commodities currently exceeding global inflation rates
8250670 the foreseeable challenges ahead will be in managing the volatile cost of our product base which can vary monthly while consumers are accepting of the increase in food costs rapid changes to our product pricing would lead to attrition of our customer base both in the retail and wholesale markets with the closing of wf laish in the us we are carefully reviewing our merger and acquisition strategy the us however remains a strategic region of interest for willi food and for now we are objectively seeking potential partnerships to distribute our products with distributors who wish to grow their volume and diversify their line of premium kosher products our line of products includes over 600 exclusively distributed products by willi food and shamir salads
8250671 the results of this reporting quarter were impaired by nis 2 6 million us 0 8 million in expenses related to the closing down of wf laish and to a final arbitration award entered against the company in the amount of nis 2 0 million us 0 6 million in connection with litigation initiated by vitarroz in 2005 the balance sheet is now currently clean and we anticipate moving forward with the progress of willi food
8250672 we had hoped to provide guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year but we will not be able to do so because commodity and food prices remain in a state of flux and change from month to month however we still believe that the company is on track to end the full fiscal year profitable and expect to grow 2008 sales to be in excess of nis 330 million us 100 million we look forward to discussing our results in more detail in our conference call

8250681 we are very pleased and excited to have this prominent new marriott in the heart of raleighs city center
8250682 noble investment group is an award winning partner of marriott and we congratulate them on bringing this spectacular hotel to life for all residents and visitors to the raleigh and wake county areas
8250683 four years ago we set out to determine the lasting future of our citys downtown core and as a result of an enormous amount of passion and commitment today we celebrate the completion of an important anchor for that vision
8250684 the noble organization has been an extremely valuable partner to us and delivered a magnificent hotel that will prove to be a great enabler to the success of the new raleigh convention center and tourism in our region the raleigh marriott city center is a perfect example of how the public and private sectors can work together to realize goals of great significance to our community
8250685 the commitment of this communitys leaders to make raleigh a hub for world class business a prominent center for arts and culture a destination for meetings and conventions and a thriving place to live dine and play has fostered a remarkable transformation of this vibrant city
8250686 we are proud to be an integral part of this community and believe that our investment will bring a new level of hospitality and amenities that will continue to galvanize the landscape of raleighs city center
8250687 we were afraid wed be shunted off to some fleabag motel 50 miles from the pepsi center
8250688 instead we were assigned to a nice hotel where all the reporters were staying with cable tv room service and everything
8250689 we couldnt have asked for a nicer place to sit around in a meth haze and allegedly speculate about killing barack obama
8250690 we tried to think of everything from the number of free rental bicycles to the height of the cyclone fence around the free speech zone
8250691 the best innovation as far as crowd control goes has been the violent freaks zone
8250692 the zone is located right next to my command post which is convenient for any violent freaks attending the convention
8250693 its also handy for me and my officers monday night i checked the sign in sheet and saw tharin gartrell plus 3 and now they are assisting us in our inquiries
8250694 sen obama and sen mccain have been focusing on pocketbook issues like 4 gas global warming and security issues like energy independence now the auto industrys financial crisis has their attention
8250695 it may seem like the candidates positions are closely aligned but they actually have radically different approaches to cafe the vehicle technologies they champion and the support theyre willing to lend to automakers
8250696 plug ins are the holy grail for fuel economy because they can be driven extended distances on battery power alone and deliver in theory more than 100 miles per gallon
8250697 however major players in the industry disagree if plug ins are the answer theres also the question if 4 billion for r amp d and 7 000 incentives for consumers will be enough to perfect plug ins and other technologies put them into mass production and make the vehicles affordable for consumers on an accelerated timetable
8250698 promises made on the campaign trail have a way of moderating if the candidate gets elected but its clear that a president obama will use a carrot and stick approach to force the industry to become as green as possible and do it faster than they may be able to contain
8250699 while sen mccains endorsement of loan guarantees r amp d tax credits and consumer incentives show support for the industry his proposal to enforce cafe rather than increase it may be more important in the long run
8250700 the industry is making massive investments on borrowed money to meet the stringent fuel economy targets already on the books and they need to strive for a return on their capital increasing cafe would only increase the risks facing the industry
8250701 the cost of complying with todays fuel economy regulations alone will make cars more expensive to buy in coming years and the inflation in vehicle prices will likely outpace wage growth between now and 2014
8250702 consumers will respond by buying smaller vehicles keeping their cars and trucks longer and financing them for seven or eight years
8250703 these and other factors are going to keep industry volumes and profits under pressure
8250704 this reality may be what prompted sen mccain to reconsider loan guarantees for detroit and it may eventually lead sen obama to scale back his calls for a technology revolution or at least offer more assistance to achieve it
8250705 after careful review and consideration we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting new york sales tax effective august 21 2008

8250707 we are very pleased with how well the first auction ran
8250708 we had considerable interest and bidding from several foreign investors along with many high profile institutional buyers here in united states we expect similar or even greater interest in the september auction
8250709 we are very pleased to announce this agreement to sell a portion of our non core acreage we plan to use the proceeds of this sale to focus on our ongoing programs in the fetter field goliath bakken and krejci projects and to continue our land acquisition activities in new areas that we believe hold significant potential for american
8250710 our decision to convert a sizeable portion of our note will not only reduce debt improve cash flow and enhance the balance sheet of the company but it should also serve as a demonstration of the complete confidence we have in our business model and ability to move from a period of slow backlog turnover to profitable quarters along with significant pay cuts taken by gallagher and myself the pay reduction of board members and additional overhead reduction measures these actions will assist the company in recovering its ebitda losses experienced in the past six quarters my sole interest is to bring our company to cash flow positive and in the process increase shareholder value to our investors
8250711 we are securing business with outstanding customers who trust us with the engineering and development of their critical assets and resources our technology consulting business is very strong and for those who understand our business model tc is the precursor to projects with large positive cash flow because of this i am joining with tom to make similar concessions regarding salary as well as converting 1 million of my seller note to stock i am also restructuring the balance of my seller note to delay principal payments and interest payments until march 2010

8250749 our work with michael was always about exposing government and corporate accountability
8250750 this film shows how the government failed miserably but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8250751 those of us who work with michael believe in a lot of the same things the desire to look at things in a different way to look at issues that arent in the mainstream media
8250752 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories

8250770 i loved playing tabitha this movie was so much fun to make and i think people will really love it plus its the first time i had a really big role like this in a feature
8250771 teagan is extremely good and her fans get to see an entirely different side of her as tabitha becomes one sexy 18 year old cutie
8250772 i will say her sex scene with the little doll that she magically turns into a full sized man is the sexiest hardcore scene i have ever shot
8250773 that was so much fun to make because ron jeremy and sunny and i had to pop in and out of the orgy like magic

8250789 as municipalities are expected to increase electricity costs to consumers by at least 32 6 barring the poorer areas before october we expect further increases in the fuel and power component with september likely to be marked by high pricing risk as municipalities rush to price ahead of the legislated date
8250790 so the remainder of the third quarter is likely to see further increases in electricity tariffs as captured in the cpi
8250791 some municipalities were not ready for implementation in july and may only raise tariffs sometime before october 1 should this adjustment fall outside stats sas three week survey period the price increase would fall in october
8250792 if this switch to targeting headline cpi were to occur the unchanged interest rate stance in august would have already contributed directly to an improved inflation view next year as the inflation level was spared some 0 3 percentage points from what could have been a further lift to the housing component cpi therefore ends the year off at a lower level relative to cpix with the concomitant drop in january pushing the new expected targeted measure lower than the incumbent measure

8250822 you have to be responsible and say no not only to protect yourself but to make that other person be responsible

8250827 women are better with money than men and more attuned to financial pressures the woman will go and seek help and seek a solution versus the guy who buries his head in the sand and hopes things turn out better

8250985 saying naxals are behind the attack is totally misleading and orchestrated this is an attack by the agents of christian missionaries whose attempts at forcible conversions the swamiji countered
8250986 they tried and failed for seven times the eighth time they have succeeded a week before he was killed he had received an anonymous threat that said he would soon be killed though he lodged a formal complaint the officials did not do anything about it
8250987 the administration failed to ensure that the churches and christian institutions were attacked in return so this might be an act of revenge for that given the fact that lakshmanananda was actively combating forcible conversions in the region
8250988 they were very quick to do it probably because they wanted to ensure that communal violence does not break out but eventually they werent able to do that also

8251015 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8251016 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8251019 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8251020 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8251021 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8251022 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8251023 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results

8251027 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8251028 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8251029 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8251030 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8251031 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8251032 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8251033 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8251034 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8251035 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8251036 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
8251037 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
8251038 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
8251039 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
8251040 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
8251041 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony

8251046 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
8251047 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
8251048 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
8251049 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
8251050 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
8251051 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey

le voyage a surpris largot sy d verse avec une abondance qui choqua aujour dhui que c line est all beaucoup plus loin dans cette voie le langage de son premier roman nous parait presque classique cest que la syntaxe aussi y est plus proche du fran ais litt raire elle y est plus vari e alors que dans les uvres qui ont suivi avec des phrases courtes s par es par de sempiternels points de suspen sion elle est dune monotonie et dune simplicit qui confondent parfois ajoutons que tout est clair dans le voyage peu de mots invent s ou d form s qui abondent ailleurs et dont linvention souvent splendide est aussi quelquefois inutile et abusive point d pisodes sau grenus dun surr alisme de la canaille point de petits ballets macabres et de fantaisie d brid e comme dans bagatelles point de ces pages

8251147 this film shows how the government failed miserably but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8251148 those of us who work with michael believe in a lot of the same things the desire to look at things in a different way to look at issues that arent in the mainstream media
8251149 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories

8251182 i am very happy to stay here because i consider this club to be my home
8251183 what was most important was that the club showed that i am important to them i did not have to think for long about things
8251184 i really appreciate all the effort the club made i did not delay my decision because it was the best choice for me
8251185 since the departure of nicky shorey we have been looking to supplement the left hand side of our squad and the signing of chris armstrong has given us the opportunity to do that
8251186 doobs popped his calf and that usually means something reasonably significant so i cant imagine him being available for another three or four weeks from now
8251187 i dont remember being that angry after a game i was furious because we didnt create a lot
8251188 i want to keep that all internal my state is not so important what is important is the performance of arsenal
8251189 we keep that internal and secret we had a bad game and it happens fulham had a good game as well
8251190 you cannot say you are happy when you lose a game in the way we lost that game what is very important is the way we respond
8251191 we want to play at the top level and to be at the top level is to be in the champions league
8251192 james has a three year contract with us at the moment i dont even want to talk about losing james milner
8251193 hes a very important player for us and i think hes worthy of a call up to the senior england side hes been too long in the under 21s once youve played 30 odd games for the under 21s you deserve a crack at the big time
8251194 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8251195 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park
8251196 he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8251197 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of the player

8251204 we depend on the talent and professionalism of our men and women in uniform and our service academies provide many of them with such an incredibly valuable educational foundation academy days provide an opportunity for young people in our state to learn more about what the service academies have to offer and i encourage all eligible west virginians to join us and learn how they can serve our great nation
8251205 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one

8251300 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8251301 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8251302 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8251303 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8251304 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8251305 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8251306 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8251312 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8251352 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8251353 no one works for someone we all just work together
8251354 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8251355 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8251356 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8251357 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8251358 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8251359 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8251360 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8251361 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8251362 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8251363 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8251364 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8251365 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8251366 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8251367 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8251368 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8251369 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8251370 raid z wouldnt require any special hardware it doesnt need nvram for correctness and it doesnt need write buffering for good performance with raid z zfs makes good on the original raid promise it provides fast reliable storage using cheap commodity disks
8251371 however whenever i unplug the sata cable from one of the drives to simulate a catastrophic drive failure while doing moderate reading from the zpool such as streaming hd video not only does the video hang on the remote machine which is accessing the zpool via nfs but the server running opensolaris seems to either hang or become incredibly unresponsive
8251372 never try this sort of thing thp gt with ide
8251373 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8251374 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8251375 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8251376 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8251377 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8251378 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8251379 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8251380 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8251381 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8251382 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8251383 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8251384 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8251385 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8251386 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8251387 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8251388 we saved the world i say we have to party
8251389 he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of jesus christ
8251390 lord jesus i repent of all my sins come into my heart and be my lord and saviour

8251413 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8251414 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8251415 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8251416 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8251417 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8251418 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8251419 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8251420 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8251421 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8251422 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8251423 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8251424 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8251425 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8251426 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8251427 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8251428 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8251429 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8251430 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8251431 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8251432 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8251433 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8251434 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8251435 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8251436 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8251437 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8251438 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8251439 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8251440 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8251441 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8251442 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8251443 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8251444 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8251445 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8251446 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8251447 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8251448 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8251449 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8251450 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8251451 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8251452 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8251453 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8251454 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8251455 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8251456 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8251462 right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract
8251463 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8251464 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8251465 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let him go if roman begins to play in england this will be good both for him and for the team
8251466 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8251467 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled

8251474 two to four more suspects are yet to be caught and they would reveal more about the timers used
8251475 the real estate mafia would be curbed through new legislation if it is required already we have laws that prevent such buying of land
8251476 you know today so many people still do not have land and in three months time we will distribute land that we seized during the munnar operations last year to the landless
8251477 the present bout of controversy over the second phase of land reforms will only help the real estate mafia
8251478 the credit crunch and soaring consumer prices are clearly having a massive impact on british families
8251479 this is extremely worrying news for prime minister gordon brown whose claims that all is well with uk plc are now looking well wide of the mark
8251480 the government cannot possibly continue to play down the severity of the economic crisis the uk faces when millions of people can barely make ends meet
8251481 his life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that cricket continues to grow stronger soccer has pele cricket has bradman no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8251482 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8251483 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8251484 as a captain too he looked to lead as he played in a positive manner and his 1948 side including the likes of keith miller neil harvey arthur morris and ray lindwall is rightly remembered as one of the greatest line ups of all time
8251485 i am delighted australia is leading the tributes to sir donald with its captain ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration in sydney
8251486 cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and i am sure rickys speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person
8251487 the central government is ready with all help to contain violence in the state
8251488 patil told us that the government has promised the state all assistance be it the deployment of military forces or anything else to restore peace
8251489 the perpetrators of violence appear to be the same unscrupulous elements who created similar disturbances in the state in december last year

8251497 the businessmen community of the area is suffering for the last four years we have met a number of officials but nothing substantial has worked out this is our last attempt to convince the authorities the next time we will intensify our protest and involve the common man and other unions of the area
8251498 the engineer in chief has assured us a quick and permanent solution to this problem this patch of national highway nh 21a has been deteriorating over the past years and is full of potholes that lead to perennial traffic jams
8251499 no one wants to come here for business all our office vehicles are in bad shape there are no street lights and crime in this area is an all time high
8251500 more than 3 000 small and large scale industries are suffering this also leads to stress and cervical problems among our employees and wastage of precious fuel and growing pollution
8251501 we havent had the meeting officially but i just dont think he will be called up he hasnt earned it injuries are injuries but you cant reward somebody because of it
8251502 yeah there was this guy in my network who added me i thought he looked ok but his updates were really cramping my news feed so i had to deface him

8251505 the negotiations are closer than what it was two years ago we have to ensure that there is mutual benefit from the deal
8251506 we are now discussing what happens if oil is found and production begins
8251507 ongc mittal want 50 percent share but we want a majority stake for the kazakh company
8251508 i dont think if a foreign company came down to india and asked for a majority stake in an oil block they will be given it
8251509 we can only hold discussions on the principles of the agreement but not on the commercial terms as our new national tax code is still being decided
8251510 we offered it a choice of oil blocks which was unprecedented
8251511 it is a commercial negotiation between two companies we have no role
8251512 we are targeting 84 million barrels next year and 150 million barrels by 2013
8251513 transportation is a problem and we discussed it during our talks
8251514 armed with creativity righteousness and courage students can face the challenges that lie ahead of them
8251515 give students the skills to navigate the sea of knowledge so that they become life long learners
8251516 teachers should become facilitators and knowledge managers in order to inculcate an aptitude for entrepreneurship in the students

8251522 tapi hidup kita tidak seluruhnya matematika dan angka angka ada dimensi non matematis dan di luar angka angka logis
8251523 ya kalau kita hanya tertuju pada gaji kita akan menjadi orang pelit individualis bahkan bisa jadi tamak loba karena berapapun sebenarnya nilai gaji setiap orang dia tidak akan pernah merasa cukup lalu dia akan berkata bagaimana mau sedekah untuk kita saja kurang
8251524 mana mungkin dengan gaji sebesar itu kita bisa hidup tenang bisa sedekah bisa berbagi
8251525 ya karena kita masih menggunakan pola pikir matematis cobalah keluar dari medium itu oke sakarang jawab pertanyaan saya kita punya uang sepuluh ribu makan bakso enam ribu es campur tiga ribu yang seribu kita berikan pada pengemis berapa sisa uang kita
8251526 tapi saya jawab masih ada kita masih memiliki sisa seribu rupiah dan seribu rupiah itu abadi bahkan memancing rezeki yang tidak terduga
8251527 ya memang habis karena kita masih memakai logika matematis tapi cobalah tinggalkan pola pikir itu dan beralihlah pada logika sedekah uang yang seribu itu dinikmati pengemis jangan salah bisa jadi puluhan lontaran doa keberkahan untuk kita keluar dari mulut pengemis itu atas pemberian kita itu baru satu pengemis bagaimana jika kita memberikannya lebih itu dicatat malaikat dan didengar allah itu menjadi sedekah kita pada allah dan menjadi penolong di akhirat sesungguhnya yang seribu itulah milik kita yang abadi sementara nilai bakso dan es campur itu ujung ujungnya masuk wc
8251528 terus gimana caranya mas agar bias menyeimbangkan nilai metematis dengan dimensi sedekah itu
8251529 pertama ingat sedekah tidak akan membuat orang jadi miskin tapi sebaliknya menjadikan ia kaya kedua jangan terikat dengan keterbatasan gaji tapi percayalah pada keluasan rizki ketiga lihatlah ke bawah jangan lihat ke atas dan yang terakhir padukanlah nilai qonaah ridha dan syukur

8251578 wii fit for a birthday party and had to borrow my copy
8251579 nintendo had a substantial supply nationwide for launch though some stores saw spot shortages due to unprecedented demand for this unique product the consumer response to wii fit at launch was historically exceptional when compared with peripheral based video game products we are providing retailers with a constant supply of wii fit so you should see a regular supply of wii fit on store shelves as we move through the summer and into the holidays

8251592 surely the lord is in this place and i did not know it
8251593 faith enables our spiritual sense to function where faith is defective the result will be inward insensibility and numbness toward spiritual things this is the condition of vast numbers of christians today no proof is necessary to support that statement we have but to converse with the first christian we meet or enter the first church we find open to acquire all the proof we need a spiritual kingdom lies all about us enclosing us embracing us altogether within reach of our inner selves waiting for us to recognize it god himself is here waiting our response to his presence this eternal world will come alive to us the moment we begin to reckon upon its reality faith creates nothing it simply reckons upon that which is already there god and the spiritual world are real we can reckon upon them with as much assurance as we reckon upon the familiar world around us spiritual things are there or rather we should say here inviting our attention and challenging our trust
8251594 the lord is in this place and i did not know it
8251595 as we begin to focus upon god the things of the spirit will take shape before our inner eyes obedience to the word of christ will bring an inward revelation of the godhead john 14 21 23 it will give acute perception enabling us to see god even as is promised to the pure in heart a new god consciousness will seize upon us and we shall begin to taste and hear and inwardly feel the god who is our life and our all there will be seen the constant shining of the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world john 1 9 more and more as our faculties grow sharper and more sure god will become to us the great all and his presence the glory and wonder of our lives

8251616 the r8 is the first production audi bearing the name and genes of a successful racing sportscar and is therefore an excellent base from which to build up our first big customer sport programme

8251620 in face of crisis different states are doing the best they can to come up with band aid solutions
8251621 is this fact the majority of those people without insurance are employed
8251622 whether its 47 million or 45 million uninsured americans thats not an acceptable number
8251623 i realize as difficult times continue you may see people dropping coverage as they lose jobs or employers cut back
8251624 were just as concerned with keeping costs down for those who have coverage as with getting the 45 million into coverage
8251625 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8251626 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process

8251628 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8251629 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8251630 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world

8251644 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8251645 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8251646 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future

8251685 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8251697 ragazzi miei comincio a capire la virt del potere e qualcosa che va di pari passo con limmaginazione da questo momento e per sempre la mia libert senza pi limiti

8251699 non sono un idealista io non sono un poeta non posso accontentarmi dei ricordi non saprei che farmene e un vizio che ignoro non mi sono mai masturbato ho cnosciuto lamore a dodici anni non ho avuto il tempo di abbandonarmi a delle fantasie ho bisogno di un corpo di una donna con delle braccia con degli odori damore il resto per i funzionari i commedianti e gli impotenti
8251700 quando poggio la mia mano sul corpo di unaltra donna tutto il rimpianto della tua carne mi sale alle labbra e quando qualcuna si appoggia alla mia spalla lucciderei senza concederle un sorriso per punirla di avere tentato dimitare una tenerezza che non appartiene ad altri che a te

8251703 se io avessi il potere di caligola agirei come lui dato che sono animato dalle sue stesse passioni ma c un punto sul quale non posso essere daccordo con voi ed che se caligola pericoloso se vi ha reso la vita insopportabile non certo per le sue oscenit per le sue crudelt per i suoi delitti ma perch passioni pi alte e pi mortali lo sorreggono ecco ve lo dico subito attraverso caligola per la prima volta nella storia la poesia provoca lazione e il sogno la realizza lui fa ci che sogna di fare lui trasforma la sua filosofia in cadaveri voi dite che un anarchico lui crede di essere un artista ma in fondo non c differenza finch caligola vivo io sono alla completa merc del caso e dellassurdo cio della poesia vedo sui vostri volti risentiti il sudore della paura anchio ho paura ma io ho paura di quel lirismo disumano al cui confronto la mia vita non niente e questo il mostro che ci divora ve lo dico io se c un solo individuo puro nel male o nel bene il nostro mondo in pericolo ecco perch caligola deve morire
8251704 e una preziosa virt di questo tuo cuore ragazzo mio potessi conoscere anchio la tua trasparenza ma io sono animato da ua passione troppo forte per la vita la natura non le baster ma tu non puoi capire sei di un altro mondo tu sei puro nel bene come io sono puro nel male
8251705 la solitudine s la solitudine la conosci tu la solitudine si quella dei poeti e degli impotenti la solitudine quale solitudine ma non lo sai che non si mai soli e che dovunque ci portiamo addosso tutto il peso del nostro passato e anche quello del nostro futuro tutti quelli che abbiamo ucciso sono sempre con noi fossero solo loro poco male ma ci sono anche quelli che abbiamo amato quelli che non abbiamo amato e ci hanno amato il rimpianto il desiderio il disincanto e la dolcezza le puttane e la banda degli dei solo ah se soltanto potessi godere la vera solitudine non questa mia solitudine infestata di fantasmi ma quella vera fatta di silenzio e tremore tutta lebbrezza del flusso del mio cuore
8251706 c sempre un momento di felicit nella vita per tutti e questo che ci d modo di continuare e a questo che ci si afferra quando ci si sente svuotati
8251707 amare qualcuno vuol dire accettare dinvecchiare con lui i non sono capace di un tale amore crediamo di conoscere il dolore quando perdiamo chi amiamo ma c una sofferenza molto pi terribile quando ci accorgiamo che anche i dolori non durano a lungo anche il dolore non ha senso vedi non mi resta pi niente nemmeno lomba di un amore nemmeno la dolcezza della malinconia lei non era che un alibi per me oggi sono molto pi libero di allora dato che non pi ricordi n illusioni

8251719 the words of his speeches inspired the song i didnt write a lyric the only thing i wrote was the melody
8251720 i could say i support barack obama i want him to be the president or i could do an immediate thing
8251721 i dont think barack said yeah i like will i think its the song he embraced the song cause i captured the message
8251722 i didnt put my opinion on it i think barack and the campaign embraced the song its beyond me
8251723 its important cause its engaging the people who have supported him
8251724 but with the momentum of the victory thats going to propel us up the hill its beyond just black and white its american and im just happy to be here
8251725 martin luther king is getting dressed in the morning coretta scott king is dusting his shoulders off hes about to go out the dude waiting in the car im him i dont know if im his homie im just gonna drive him to where hes going and im gonna talk to him then he came with the track when we heard that beat we went nuts i immediately wrote three verses
8251726 so many people tried to take that record off the album this record is a hip hop must that record never can say goodbye and angel those are the meat and potatoes of what hip hop is about
8251727 i dont even believe i be writing sh like that sometimes when im in the zone man im in the zone
8251728 i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scotts teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f in head shot i wonder why jesse jackson didnt catch him before his body drop would he give me the answer probably not
8251729 jesse jackson all the things hes done great for our people you commend him for it but jesse jackson was wrong for what he did
8251730 i wanted to expose a little of his dark side dont forget he had a baby out of wedlock awhile back everybody is imperfect but when you do something like that disrespect a situation thats affecting us all on an everyday basis people like me with voices gotta step in
8251731 jesse jackson is always in pictures with martin luther king and hes always talking about martin luther king in his speeches
8251732 on the day king got shot he wasnt there editors note jackson was present at the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee when king was assassinated in april 1968 but he was not on the balcony with king when he was shot when i say how come you couldnt catch your mans body when it dropped its because you couldnt if you wanted to you was somewhere else you claimed to be his man where were you that day
8251733 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8251740 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8251741 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8251742 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8251743 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8251744 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8251745 you should listen to and obey your ruler even if he was an ethiopian black slave whose head looks like a raisin
8251746 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8251747 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8251748 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8251749 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8251750 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8251751 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8251752 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8251753 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8251754 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8251755 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8251756 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8251757 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8251758 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8251759 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8251760 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8251761 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8251762 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8251763 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8251764 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8251765 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8251766 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8251767 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8251768 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8251769 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8251770 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8251771 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8251772 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8251773 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8251774 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8251775 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8251776 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8251777 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8251778 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8251779 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8251780 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8251781 after my next domestic abuse incident ill need the services of jacoby amp
8251782 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8251783 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8251784 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8251785 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8251786 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8251787 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8251788 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8251789 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8251790 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8251791 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8251792 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8251793 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8251794 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8251795 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8251796 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8251797 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8251798 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8251799 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8251800 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8251801 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8251802 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8251803 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8251804 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8251805 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8251911 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8251912 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8251913 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8251914 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8251915 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8251916 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8251917 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune

8251919 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8251920 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8251921 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8251940 they need to know what they are spending their money on
8251941 this is the start of a budget now they have some more accurate numbers to work with
8251942 it certainly can help to show how saving to make a purchase and not just spending impulsively can help in the long run
8251943 if you are considering buying something ask yourself do i need it or is it just a want do not buy it right at that moment
8251944 leave the store and think about it and see if you decide to come back and purchase the item at a later date
8251945 if you overspend with a debit card and get an overdraft you are not ready for a credit card
8251946 i have found that if a young person understands that the same amount of money they pay every month for a minimum payment on their credit card could potentially make them a millionaire by the time they reach 65 they might think twice about using that credit card
8251947 parents need to take the time to talk to their children
8251948 if they parents are spenders they should tell their children you do not want to live paycheck to paycheck like we do if they are savers let them know how that has worked for them
8251949 a bad credit score can mean not being able to buy a car or home it also can mean higher interest rates and future credit costing you more
8251950 i think the credit card issue is about scaring students some but still letting them know that when they are used properly credit cards can be a good financial tool

8251957 as most people know usually by personal experience modern u s health care is hugely expensive and does not always assure safety
8251958 what were doing is exploring virtual worlds and ubiquitous computing that is the not so utopian and imminent world in which everything including objects is alive by virtue of being connected to a network as a model for efficient operations the ultimate goal is to move beyond modeling so that these systems may actually be used as tools in real hospitals real pharmacies and clinics and other care facilities
8251959 in the everything is alive vision objects talk to each other
8251960 our virtual objects do this and increasingly so can wirelessly connected real world objects so its time to generate a rich collection of vignettes or workflows that exercise this capability to understand it better for example well work on a situation in which a blood pressure machine interacts intelligently with an iv drip so that the latter can adjust appropriately based on information received from the former all of this can happen without fallible humans manually controlling both machines
8251961 some argue that my students and i are just having fun that we could model all of these things in older technologies such as queuing theory
8251962 my response is yes we are having fun and were beginning to see how virtual worlds excel in providing users with understandable simulations of business practices if the real world is moving toward identity management technologies like rfid to keep track of things we can get there first in a virtual world analyze business situations and then optimize to make them safer and less expensive

8252067 a successful system will not only improve the quality of the recycled polymer but it will enable new to be manufactured with a higher recycled content in closed loop recycling systems
8252068 increasing the use of recycled content will deliver carbon dioxide co2 savings through greater substitution of virgin polymer in the manufacture of new bottles as well as conserve valuable resources and divert waste from landfill
8252069 the roadmap contains targets for closed loop recycling of plastic milk bottles as well as dairies sending near zero waste to landfill

8252126 exploring the two subjects simultaneously shows that at any given time each discipline somehow influences the other
8252127 the visual dialogue between say the myriad graffiti taggers or untrained nonapprenticed letterers doing sign work and legions of self taught novice users of type design software
8252128 if we look at graffiti and typography and study their visual commonalities as lettering much is revealed writing is graphic design this is the first line of gerrit noordzijs essay the nature of writing the introduction to his argument that writing is graphic in nature and reliant upon aspects of visual perception such as form rhythm color shade and composition examinations of vernacular lettering have explored the visual and semantic importance of our most common surroundings in doing so graffiti was often noted but had rarely been critically assessed in design writing within the last thirty years perhaps deemed too transgressive too immature or too inaccessible to design culture at large graffiti had consistently been treated as kids stuff as graffiti matured and diversified more and more of its aesthetics seeped into graphic design and it gained acceptance in the popular culture at large beyond aesthetic fashion and subcultural trends graffiti and design specifically typography share a common ancestry in the written word
8252129 theres an often hidden relationship between these two lettering practices typeface design and graffiti that is worth looking deeper into i hope this book helps others find meaning and widen interest in both the historical and contemporary landscape of lettering
8252130 graffiti writing is an activity completely reliant on the tag we can see graffiti writing as a genre that generally speaking revolves around typography and letter formation
8252131 i had come up with the idea for this project about a year or so before attending calarts

8252134 ive always self published on one level or another and wordshape is the culmination of that in the 90s i ran a small d i y publishing venture called migraine that put out zines comics books and the occasional record wordshape is similar in spirit though the output differs in being focused on language both spoken and physical
8252135 not planning to do a reprint at the present time there are still enough copies out there to satisfy initial demand i would be interested in partnering with a larger publisher for a second edition but the opportunity would have to present itself

8252181 i shot this photograph in a remote village called gourdah in west bengal the woman in my picture is returning home from the paddy field after a long day at work as a farmers housewife she has to manage her home child and also help her husband in the field they are very poor
8252182 she never thought that a village woman could be the subject of a photograph so when i told her that i would like to take a picture of her she just laughed
8252183 the mother and child the green paddy field and the blue sky after rain fill me happiness hope and joy

8252197 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8252198 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8252199 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8252200 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8252201 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8252210 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8252211 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8252212 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8252213 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

8252233 if you had not insisted on driving everyone tonight it could have been worse more dead
8252234 and if we had not take all the weapons and ammo out while making room we would have been under armed
8252235 that there was the ten of us and no wounded helped
8252236 looks like they got everyone who was not dead together and attacked in force it must have taken them half the night to find everyone
8252237 everyone is right chronos i am not sure we could have done as well if we had civilians to defend or even if having everyone armed would have made a difference

8252241 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8252242 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8252243 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8252244 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8252245 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8252246 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8252247 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8252248 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8252249 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8252250 these parliament members have been on the police wanted list which we made public
8252251 we have been looking for them for a long time since the offenses were committed
8252252 had fled the country to mozambique south africa botswana and so forth
8252253 the arrests are harassment and an attempt to undermine our parliamentary majority
8252254 we expected that retribution after having shown mugabe that he is not welcome in parliament
8252255 the cabinet that i had was the worst in history
8252256 they only look at themselves they are unreliable but not all of them the people are suffering
8252257 the fact that the plane was kidnapped from darfur indicates that one of the militant groups may have prepared for this operation and the fact that they want to go to france adds more to that theory

8252266 those displaced by the flooding are not expected to be able to return to their homes for another two or three months when the embankment is repaired and the river moves back to its normal course until then these people will need to stay in relief camps

8252273 zal has been a voice of strong criticism that goes way beyond u s policy of the government of karzai and that opinion reflects his personal view
8252274 this has been a problem going back two years on the pakistan account
8252275 the pakistan political situation is highly unstable right now and the last thing the u s needs is for it to become the central focus of that instability through accusations that it is propping up or scheming behind the scenes with one of the major political players
8252276 pakistani leaders are also guilty of putting too much attention on currying favor with u s leaders rather than focusing on governing their own country and dealing with the myriad of challenges there
8252277 he is the former ambassador to iraq and afghanistan his close relationship to the president has been acknowledged
8252278 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government
8252279 it is irresponsible to engage in that dialogue while you are a sitting official and taking an oath to be a representative of the u s government

8252286 we need non verbal cues to tell us what is important what is significant and what should we be looking for
8252287 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8252288 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8252289 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8252290 when she was talking about things that were important to her i did notice non verbals like healthcare
8252291 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8252292 i noticed that she does something with her shoulders maybe thats how she emphasizes
8252293 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8252294 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but thats so weak that we tend to miss it
8252295 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8252296 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth

8252301 sammy wilson is ill informed on the reality of the situation but i guess that he will not believe much of our present climate change is man made until the water is lapping up his knees in east belfast which is low lying
8252302 there is no doubt the very rapid increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity is a major cause of climate change
8252303 he should look at all the government produced analysis climatic and economic before making such sweeping statements with no scientific validity
8252304 the basic science is so clear and unambiguous that anyone denying it is either a fool or deliberately misleading others for political or other ends the impacts of climate change already observed and apparent are everywhere and northern ireland is not immune

8252349 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
8252350 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
8252351 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year
8252352 this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place this would be an anti abortion statute
8252353 obama has also voted present again effectively a no vote on requiring parental notification not parental consent when minor children obtain abortions
8252354 i could find no instance in his entire career in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
8252355 barack obama is the most pro abortion presidential candidate ever
8252356 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act
8252357 this bill would effectively cancel every state federal and local regulation of abortion no matter how modest or reasonable it would even according to the national organization of women abolish all state restrictions on government funding for abortions
8252358 in promising to sign this bill obama is promising to abolish state laws that protect doctors and nurses from losing their jobs if they refuse to participate in abortions
8252359 politicians promises are often empty but this one deserves to be taken seriously
8252360 how could you consider selecting someone who opposed the federal partial birth abortion ban and was one of the eleven original cosponsors of the radical freedom of choice act as your vice president
8252361 i think i made it very clear saturday night i have a pro life record that i have pro life policies and my administration will have pro life policies
8252362 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities
8252363 senator obamas manufactured indignation and continued misrepresentations of illinois legislation have one common goal
8252364 obscure the reality that he opposed recognizing as legally protected persons babies who were born alive during abortions during the fourth and fifth months of development
8252365 released a heavily biased report with a sweeping pro abortion conclusion based upon one solitary study to the detriment of american womens health
8252366 the apa needs to hear from you that a new more scientifically based report is needed
8252367 any research needs to be broader in scope and include studies that this report ignored
8252368 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain
8252369 a gop strategist says the former pennsylvania governor is no longer being considered as mccains veep
8252370 the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies
8252371 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
8252372 there is no room for these kinds of distortions and lies in this campaign
8252373 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
8252374 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
8252375 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law
8252376 mccain would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives the republicans most reliable voting bloc over the past three decades
8252377 the supreme court is currently effectively deadlocked on the life issues
8252378 if a pro lifer were to take the white house in 2009 he would have the opportunity to fill up to three supreme court seats with judges who share his views creating a strong majority on the court
8252379 the illinois senators prospective judicial appointments as outlined in the national journal are not only pro choice but zealously so
8252380 without the divine we cannot and without us he will not
8252381 this claim was verified to wnd by other diplomatic sources involved in the negotiations
8252382 this incident is in addition to similar cases in which trade minister ehud olmert intervened whether directly or indirectly via his assistants in the activity of the investment center
8252383 the tourism and finance ministries agreed to promote this project after several probes the industry trade and labor ministry acted according to the professional perception and in cooperation with the other government offices involved in the issue
8252384 your presence in the area represents a danger to the public order
8252385 the olive harvest season begins only at the end of my four month expulsion
8252386 that the reason they got me is because of a pact that was recently made among the various shomron towns called mutual responsibility which states that whenever the army or police come to evict jews from a hilltop or town the jews of all the other towns and hilltops in the area do what they can to stop it even if it is only by standing in an intersection and reciting psalms or holding signs the general security service shabak seems to think that im involved and thats why they have given me these orders
8252387 the issue here is not a humanitarian one for me and my family but rather a national one the authorities weak point is that they cant take it when we show solidarity with each other
8252388 and i am about to plant a grape orchard of ten dunams 2 5 acres following the end of this shemittah year during which planting is not allowed by jewish law ed a few weeks from now in addition i also market flour and if i disappear for four months my market will be gone
8252389 it is sad that arab olives are more important than the lives of idf soldiers
8252390 the police have not issued any such orders to left wing activists who demonstrate in balin and endanger idf soldiers but they are quick to do so when it comes to arab olives
8252391 this is a grave blow to civil rights of israeli citizens
8252392 it only happens vis a vis one side of the political map
8252393 the three are not even allowed to remain in their homes and not leave they must leave their homes altogether
8252394 if there is evidence of a crime those suspected must be tried but not restricted in this arbitrary manner this is an intolerable blow to civil rights that must be stopped it is not rooted in any law but is rather given solely to the arbitrary decision of the military commander o c central command maj gen gad shamni in the area
8252395 this initiative the first of its kind in israel is part of our overall preparedness for the anticipated increase in tourism generally and for the citys centenary in particular
8252396 was a record year for tourism in tel aviv registering an increase of 23 in the number of tourists visiting the city over the previous year during 2007 income from tourist overnights in the city exceeded two billion shekels
8252397 the drilling and extraction of oil could harm whole populations of rare species we believe that the foreseen production does not justify the permit to severely and permanently harm plants and wildlife as well as the landscape and tourists in an official nature reserve
8252398 i know the area well and its just another place in the desert
8252399 israel is not rich enough to allow itself to forgo such potential
8252400 the spni is distressed by the fact that members of the parks authority assembly who voted in favor of the plan caved in to pressure exerted by the entrepreneurs did not heed its own science committees recommendation against the plan and approved an appeal that will cause needless harm to a nature reserve
8252401 the fact that this will set a precedent for other cases
8252402 even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the justice department despite the fact that hamas and the palestine islamic jihad are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect the bank of china to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism
8252403 the number of missiles in the hands of hizbullah has doubled if not tripled and that the range of the missiles has been extended and this has been accomplished with the close assistance of the syrians
8252404 hizbullah by admission of its leaders on several occasions has replenished its military capacity since the 2006 war with israel i therefore remain concerned that this border remains vulnerable to such weapons transfers which would represent serious violations of the resolution and constitute a significant threat to the stability and security of lebanon
8252405 and the decision whether to arrest him will be taken at the end of the probe
8252406 we are very pleased that after much discussion the president included sustained access for recreational fishing in the central pacific region as an integral part of a conservation management plan
8252407 we are even more pleased that the president chose not to include two areas of great concern for the sportfishing community the gulf of mexicos islands in the stream and marine areas of the southeast united states
8252408 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
8252409 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
8252410 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year
8252411 this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place this would be an anti abortion statute
8252412 obama has also voted present again effectively a no vote on requiring parental notification not parental consent when minor children obtain abortions
8252413 i could find no instance in his entire career in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
8252414 barack obama is the most pro abortion presidential candidate ever
8252415 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act
8252416 this bill would effectively cancel every state federal and local regulation of abortion no matter how modest or reasonable it would even according to the national organization of women abolish all state restrictions on government funding for abortions
8252417 in promising to sign this bill obama is promising to abolish state laws that protect doctors and nurses from losing their jobs if they refuse to participate in abortions
8252418 atheism is a belief system as atheists believe there is no god even though there is no proof of it

8252433 as we have been repeating for the nearly two years since its creation the un human rights council is far from being up to the job it has been given
8252434 the change to the mandate of the special rapporteur on free expression is dramatic it turns someone who is supposed to defend freedom of opinion into a prosecutor whose job is to go after those who abuse this freedom
8252435 there are other mechanisms for condemning racist attacks or defamation by the media it is not the rapporteur on free expressions job to do this it is like asking the rapporteur on freedom of religion to investigate human rights abuses committed in the name of religion such reasoning is absurd
8252436 the growing influence of organisation of the islamic conference member states within the human rights council is disturbing all of the councils decisions are nowadays determined by the interests of the muslim countries or powerful states such as china or russia that know how to surround themselves with allies the un secretary general should intervene as quickly as possible
8252437 the mandates of the special rapporteurs on cuba and belarus two of the worlds worst press freedom predators were not renewed in may 2007
8252438 last week it was democratic republic of congos turn to get rid of its special human rights rapporteur it is deplorable that these countries in which serious human rights violations are committed every day are no longer subject to closing monitoring and criticism by the un
8252439 we the undersigned are deeply concerned that the proposed amendment undermines the mandate of the special rapporteur on freedom of expression at a time when it most needs protection and strengthening

8252649 moved to close the divide among fellow democrats on tuesday night by offering a forceful and unequivocal endorsement of her fierce rival
8252650 deferred her own dreams on tuesday night and delivered an emphatic plea at the democratic national convention to unite behind her rival senator barack obama no matter what ill will lingers
8252651 betrayed none of the anger and disappointment that she still feels and that friends say has especially haunted her husband
8252652 rest to a bitter primary battle that left many of her supporters especially women seething months later
8252653 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8252654 did her best to put the hard feelings to rest
8252655 michael barone a conservative commentator was nearly as lavish in his praise if you read through the text its unimpeachable i guess i shouldnt use that term
8252656 genuinely believes that if john mccain wins it will be bad for the country she knows that she wants barack obama to win whatever disappointment she feels whatever anger she feels about barack obama and thats real too
8252657 urged her supporters to fall in line behind the presumptive democratic nominee
8252658 and obamas are still negotiating the fine details of wednesday nights roll call vote for nominating the democratic presidential candidate
8252659 did not indicate whether she would have her name placed in nomination or seek a formal roll call of the states when the partys top prize is awarded by delegates on wednesday night
8252660 say the vote traditionally a full accounting of the states may be streamlined to include only a select group they may call on clinton to step in and halt the vote early to unanimously nominate sen obama but democratic leaders are undecided as to whether that would help or hurt the unity cause
8252661 a hypothetical question in which he seemed to suggest that that the democratic party was making a mistake in choosing obama as its presidential nominee
8252662 the most recent washington post abc news poll showed that only 42 percent of clinton voters classify themselves as solidly behind obama and 20 percent plan to vote for mccain but in denver clinton supporters sometimes classified themselves as belonging to one of two categories the sad and the angry
8252663 a nettlesome problem that appears to be contributing to the campaigns failure to keep pace with ambitious fund raising goals it set for the general election
8252664 if barack obama gets the traditional post convention bounce in the polls it cant come soon enough
8252665 has led john mccain in the head to head surveys most of the summer but things at the moment appear to be changing
8252666 top elected officials continued to raise questions about obamas campaign strategy and worried aloud that he must do more to overcome the doubts voters in their states have about his readiness to be president
8252667 said that obama is still struggling to connect with working class voters and that the presumptive nominee reminded him of adlai stevenson the brainy illinoisan who lost the presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956
8252668 said obamas campaign must demonstrate its willingness to engage against a republican party that he said is well skilled in political combat
8252669 the leader of a powerful democratic union acknowledged tuesday that some of his own members might not vote for barack obama because he is black a reflection of the role the issue is once again playing as democrats fret that obamas race is a significant barrier to his presidential aspirations
8252670 told convention goers tuesday morning that polls are underestimating the strength of barack obama contending he will defeat john mccain with the support of new or intermittent voters who are not generally polled
8252671 for exhibiting a confusion about foreign affairs that the republican claimed will invite military aggression by american adversaries abroad
8252672 if he really thinks by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8252673 ridiculed the democrats call for a world that stands as one in his berlin speech last month the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership mccain said
8252674 the core of mccains speech focused on foreign policy and veterans health was aimed at dismissing obama as an internationalist ignorant of the hard facts of history he was interrupted several times by applause from a crowd of veterans who consider him one of their own
8252675 focusing on the economy during a campaign stop at an airplane plant
8252676 was out of touch with voters on checkbook issues if you didnt know how many homes you have no wonder you think the economy is sound obama said referring to mccains recent confusion about how many houses he and his wife cindy own
8252677 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through
8252678 showed some of the flashes of the hyperbole exaggerations and quips that republicans are hoping to use to paint him as a loose cannon
8252679 worked to defeat a bipartisan bill designed to curb asbestos lawsuits at a time his sons law firm was filing them in delaware and a former aide was lobbying against the measure according to public records and interviews

8252682 is the only member of the senate who is also being paid to be an adjunct university professor and his pay for that job did not decline when he cut his teaching time in half five years ago according to bidens 2007 financial disclosure forms he was paid a 20 500 teaching stipend by widener university in chester pa which would place him in the high end of the pay scale for adjunct university professors
8252683 charged tuesday that a barack obama presidency would make america a weaker nation the united states under an obama administration would see less prosperity and less security said romney in what could have been an 11th hour audition to join mccains ticket
8252684 in three battleground states this weekend with large scale rallies planned for ohio pennsylvania and missouri according to aides and advisers the new republican ticket will be revealed at a noontime friday rally in a dayton ohio basketball arena
8252685 we came to washington and gained a majority to change washington and washington changed us we let spending get completely out of control
8252686 by name mccain alluded to the former rancho santa fe republican congressman who was driven from office in 2006 by a massive bribery scandal
8252687 visited centers where georgian refugees from the recent war with russia are sheltering and she blamed moscow for forcing them into misery

8252689 insured an additional one million people in addition the governments military health care programs insured 400 000 more people than the year before
8252690 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8252691 experts cautioned that the report which also included data on income and poverty did not take into account the economic downturn that began late last year and therefore it probably presents a rosier picture than the current economic reality
8252692 held steady at 12 5 percent not statistically different from the 12 3 percent registered in 2006 the median or midpoint household income rose slightly to 50 233
8252693 warned on tuesday that the outlook for the ailing banking industry was bad and getting worse
8252694 the swelling tide of toxic home loans is proving to be even more worrisome than initially feared

8252696 to see it through an expected wave of bank failures

8252702 celebrations erupted in the streets of south ossetia and abkhazia today when the russian president affirmed their bids for independence from georgia
8252703 said washington would block any attempt to secure wider recognition at the un
8252704 i want to be very clear since the united states is a permanent member of the un security council this simply will be dead on arrival
8252705 warned russia to change course and respect the borders of its georgian neighbor
8252706 despite mounting international condemnation russia showed no sign of backing down
8252707 all possible outcomes had to be weighed against a sober understanding of the situation the histories of the abkhaz and ossetian peoples their freely expressed desire for independence the tragic events of the past weeks and international precedents for such a move
8252708 ignoring the delicacy of the situation unwittingly or wittingly fed the hopes of the south ossetians and abkhazians for freedom they clasped to their bosom a georgian president mikheil saakashvili whose first move was to crush the autonomy of another region adjaria and made no secret of his intention to squash the ossetians and abkhazians
8252709 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8252710 with russias image and financial markets suffering in recent days mr medvedev took the unusual step of giving a series of interviews to foreign media on tuesday to explain the move
8252711 as if to drive home the idea that recognition of the enclaves was in some sense payback mr medvedev used an interview on tuesday with russia today the kremlin financed english language channel to turn the wests rationale on kosovo against it
8252712 there was a special situation in kosovo there is a special situation in south ossetia and abkhazia

8252791 youll never know which part of the internet youll need

8252794 la coscienza che il meeting un contributo importante sia dal punto di vista della presenza della chiesa nella societ italiana e internazionale
8252795 dal punto di vista organizzativo ci sono stati sicuramente dei cambiamenti in questi anni ci sono stati dei passaggi importanti il primo ha riguardato la venuta del papa nel 1982 perch da l si capito che il meeting non era solo un simpatico evento riminese ma aveva in s anche una potenzialit di servizio culturale al paese e anche di testimonianza per la chiesa notevole cos come il papa ci aveva detto per cui da l si deciso di farlo tutti gli anni perch fino ad allora si era sempre deciso di anno in anno laltro passaggio storico stato quando ci siamo trasferiti dalla vecchia alla nuova fiera passando da 40 mila metri agli attuali 170 mila metri quello stato un passaggio molto importante a cui da un certo punto di vista siamo stati costretti perch la fiera sarebbe stata abbattuta eravamo timorosi di perderci in questo spazio immenso e invece c stata una straordinaria rispondenza di pubblico gi nella prima edizione del 2003 questo ha voluto dire strutturarsi in maniera ancora pi precisa a livello organizzativo ora sono 14 le persone che lavorano stabilmente al meeting come dipendenti nell1982 erano tre questo aiuta anche il lavoro dei volontari che rimane comunque come ben si capisce il 99 9 in questi giorni ci sono 3250 persone che lavorano 800 persone hanno lavorato dal 13 al 23 agosto per montare il meeting e durante lanno sono circa 100 150 i volontari che ci supportano i volontari rimangono negli anni un elemento fondamentale quello che abbiamo tentato di fare stato dare un ordine a questa organizzazione anche strutturando un minimo di formazione durante lanno soprattutto a livello di incontri non tanto tecnici ma che ci danno anche lorizzonte di quello che stiamo facendo inoltre maturata sempre di pi la coscienza che il meeting un contributo importante dal punto di vista della presenza della chiesa nella societ italiana e internazionale in questi ultimi anni sono tantissime le esperienze estere che partecipano al meeting questanno abbiamo il deputato brasiliano marcos zerbini del movimento dei sem terra il meeting point di kampala in uganda donaldo trento che lavora in paraguay esperienze su una dimensione veramente internazionale quindi c una maggiore coscienza dellimportanza che il meeting ha come occasione di testimonianza da parte di chi vive unesperienza cristiana della ricchezza dello stare nella realt della capacit di vivere con pienezza questo grande confronto che diventa il meeting quindi anche come possibilit per noi che lo facciamo di vivere unesperienza positiva daltra parte questa unesperienza che vive da 29 anni se non ha delle basi vere solide reali gustose belle in qualche modo capaci di compiere questo lavoro non poteva durare per tanto tempo non essendoci di mezzo la normale contropartita di un lavoro quella economica si capisce cosa c sotto tutto questo questo qui un passaggio che maturato se potessi usare uno slogan sarebbe il meeting importante ma il meeting senza le persone non ci sarebbe per cui ultimamente quello che ci interessa la maturazione umana di chi lo fa e che queste persone ci siano un po come dice il titolo di questanno cio che siano protagoniste che ci siano con la loro identit noi ci siamo con la coscienza del nostro volto che ci viene dato da un altro perch tutta la realt grida che c un altro che la fa questo altro misterioso non riusciamo a comprenderlo ma per noi una presenza reale viva cristo nella misura in cui questo diventa pi forte allora anche il meeting vive allora il meeting diventa importante per il primo scopo della nostra vita non fare il meeting ma compierci come uomini
8252796 e una sfida perch oggi pur parlando delluomo al centro di tutto sappiamo che questo non accade io penso che quando luomo veramente al centro di tutto allora vuol dire che
8252797 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8252798 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8252799 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8252800 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8252801 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8252802 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8252803 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8252804 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8252805 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8252806 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8252807 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8252808 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8252809 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8252810 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
8252811 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8252812 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8252813 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8252814 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8252815 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8252816 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8252817 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8252818 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8252819 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8252820 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8252821 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8252822 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8252823 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal

8252826 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8252827 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8252848 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8252849 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8252850 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8252896 run almost in the shadows of the gm renaissance center the detroit belle isle grand prix weekend is an appropriate stop for the american le mans series the circuit is both demanding and physical and with the edges of the track being concrete barriers there is no room whatsoever for any mistake driving a corvette in the event last year and getting to show the executives of gm what corvette racing is all about was an awesome opportunity winning made it even better
8252897 we have many great races on the alms calendar but the detroit grand prix is special its a fantastic race with a very cool atmosphere roger penske and the race organizers do a fantastic job with the facility and you feel the atmosphere as soon as you cross the bridge to belle isle the circuit is a fun track to drive but its one of those places that doesnt leave a lot of room for mistakes its a street circuit which makes it difficult to pass and to be passed by the prototypes so its really important that you have a good understanding with the drivers around you

8252945 demand refers to how much quantity of a product or service is desired by buyers the quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price

8252947 imagine that a special edition cd of your favorite band is released for 20 because the record companys previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand cds at a price higher than 20 only ten cds were released because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more if however the ten cds are demanded by 20 people the price will subsequently rise because according to the demand relationship as demand increases so does the price consequently the rise in price should prompt more cds to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price the higher the quantity supplied if however there are 30 cds produced and demand is still at 20 the price will not be pushed up because the supply more than accommodates demand in fact after the 20 consumers have been satisfied with their cd purchases the price of the leftover cds may drop as cd producers attempt to sell the remaining ten cds the lower price will then make the cd more available to people who had previously decided that the opportunity cost of buying the cd at 20 was too high

8252991 to the question why they broke the treaty i answer by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and points of difference that no one may ever have to ask the immediate cause which plunged the hellenes into a war of such magnitude the real cause i consider to be the one which was formally most kept out of sight the growth of the power of athens and the alarm which this inspired in lacedaemon made war inevitable still it is well to give the grounds alleged by either side which led to the dissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of the war

8253001 elderly in nursing homes and those who are immunocompromised and would not likely be protected by vaccination
8253002 then why does the vaccine appear to work in laboratory testing of efficacy where direct viral challenge is used in the case of in laboratory experiments to test vaccine effectiveness the vaccine is produced with a test virus that is maintained in cold storage frozen in time preventing the normal genetic drift that occurs with time in natural field environments under these artificial conditions the vaccine works every time however under field conditions when there is a vaccine production lag period allowing the virus to genetically drift effectiveness is compromised or is not there at all it is a not unusual at all for treatments etc that work in theory and under laboratory conditions but not to work when introduced to field applications there is some field evidence that seems to back up this hypothesis in barrys text the great influenza those that were infected in the first wave were only partially protected in the second wave and completely unprotected in the third wave so the genetic drift even outwitted the best of all inoculations natural vaccination by field infection within the relatively short time frame of a pandemic this is further reinforced by the fact that significant h1n1 epidemics continued until the late 1920s also indicating that the virus drifted away from natural immunity

8253323 animosity among msnbc anchors has reached a mile high peak at the democratic national convention in denver with on air squabbling between such big egos as joe scarborough keith olbermann chris matthews and david shuster
8253324 i will let you know that my party my party loathes me much more than your party the democratic party loathes me
8253325 what about your party whats your party david shuster david whats your party
8253326 oh i feel so comforted by the fact that youre independent i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards
8253327 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
8253328 the idea of anyone trying to ban tom brokaw is ludicrous
8253329 they told me technical problems and i have no reason not to believe them
8253330 do you have any ideas about a possible integration of what you call the soft tech if not anti tech sensibility of the ecovillage movement and the more pro high tech approaches such as you mention and i have also seen at work in the viridian movement of bruce sterling and the people behind worldchanging org what i see as an emerging issue is the problem of scaling how do we go from the passionate movements that you describe especially with hobby enthusiasts to the scale of global albeit locally specified and adaptable solutions that can offer any hope for our dire biospheric straits this is a feeling i often come up with you see many things happpenign and already available as concrete solutions but at the same time the mainstream seems stuck and static
8253331 what we have not as yet seen because the structural technology has not yet existed to support it is the effect on community p2p and concepts of propriety where architecture is both relatively resilient able to support higher degrees of sound and visual insulation and spontaneously adaptable at a very low level of labor as would be the case with a true plug in architectural system pavilion architecture allowed rapid evolution but still with a delay of some years between structural renovations with a need for a large labor pool for key structural elements with a plug in architecture major reconfiguration of structures becomes a one to few person task taking a few days allowing for more spontaneous experimentation and customization within an agreed upon personal space and also the major reconfiguration of a whole community in response to seasons and different situations even in the highly socially dynamic environment of past communities when a p2p negotiation was conducted on the design and construction of things the results of these group decisions had to be lived with for years to generations so there was much emphasis on coming to definitive terms before any work was done but with this new technology no decision really has to stand for a long time because theres no terribly great labor overhead in construction and components can be freely re used what might this mean for the character of a habitat also relating to this is the concept of macrostructure microstructure systems or what i refer to as functionally generic architecture which i think urban architecture is heading toward this is where you have a heavy large span macrostructure that defines the architecture of a community at the large community scale but is functionally generic at the human level like an empty loft apartment building this macrostructure is used as a host for a spontaneously adaptable in fill microstructure that because it has this larger sheltering structure functioning as a skybreak does not need to be as robust in strength and so can be lower tech this is the strategy of paulo soleris larger arcologies where the macrostructure is essentially a heavy generic structural system organized into cells of very large unit size several storeys high and as wide at they are high that the habitable architecture fills in and often conceals many people have misinterpreted arcology structures because they could not visualize the scale and so often assumed this cell structure to be analogous to a prison cell or a human scaled honeycomb when in fact its an open volume as large or larger than a typical suburban housing lot so you get this split in the nature of p2p negotiation between the non evolving or very slowly evolving macrostructure and the fast and spontaneously evolving microstructure as the personal level of course soleri never intended for there to be any p2p negotiation at the macroscale level that was his job as master architect ive had to consider this in the context of marine settlement because early on when a community is small and in sheltered water its easy to make the whole community spontaneously evolvable but when you get to the open sea your dealing in heavy concrete structural systems with massive areas of structure covered in parkland that cannot physically evolve as easily while you still need to accommodate spontaneous adaptability at the human scale to prevent these larger structures from being made functionally obsolete too quickly these are some of the things im particularly interested in seeing work in the context of a maker incubator community
8253332 concerning the question of how we bridge the divide between soft tech and eco tech the point where they meet is something pragmatic environmentalists refer to as appropriate technology what is appropriate in the sense of optimal environmental sustainability relative to the context of a particular cultural and environmental setting and its particular logistics and economics the soft tech movement was is counter culturally premised its based on the notion of turning culture back toward a presumably more sustainable pre industrial predominately agrarian way of life as a solution to the inherent ills of hard technology its based on the presumption that primitive always equals sustainable a notion whose origins rest in victorian romanticism and which tends to overlook the simple fact that western europe had largely denuded its landscape and re instituted mass slavery and indentured servitude by the start of the industrial revolution the eco tech movement is super culturally premised it suggests that unsustainability was always an inherent problem in human civilization always a precipitator of regional civilization collapse and not just a just a problem of the industrial age and that the solution is more technology not less because the natural trend in evolution of industrial technology is toward increased resource efficiency efficiency equals sustainability environmental degradation and unsustainability are thus not a product of technology itself but rather the inefficiency of a given state of technology and persists as a result of the deliberate suppression of the advance of technology for the sake of economic and political hegemonies as typified by the oil and auto industry cartels and their suppression of renewable and alternative energy technology appropriate technology takes a middle ground approach you might call alter cultural it suggests that neither high nor low tech can be regarded as automatically more sustainable sustainability is context specific it agrees with the eco tech premise that technology is not wrong or evil in and of itself but new or old technology have no automatic virtues either they are equally potentially destructive when inappropriate the plow could destroy the earth just as readily as the nuclear bomb if used the wrong way i think the biggest problem with bridging the gap here is going to be the attitudes of people in contemporary mainstream environmentalism which is sliding toward a kind of self absorbed religious extremism with an apocalyptic obsession theres much more pragmatism in the eco tech camp and so they more readily accept the notion of appropriateness even though they desire to push the edge of that as rapidly as possible but its a different story for the environmental mainstream people are not really using and advocating soft technology because its demonstrably or provably more sustainable they adopt it as an aesthetic and cultural statement and take it on faith that primitive equals sustainable you dont even hear the term soft tech used very much in the environmentalist community anymore even though it coined it any implication that what they are advocating is any kind of technology and not an alternative to technology is now blasphemy ive had arguments with self professed environmentalists where they actually objected to my use of the word efficiency in any environmental context claiming that was a corporate culture buzzword increasingly discussions of eco development mirror the sentiment of survivalists with the same malthusianist logic which often stands in stark contrast to their veneration of the virtues of community environmentalism as a movement seems to have given up on the future and now like the christian right wing is just waiting for praying for apocalypse to come and sweep the non believers out of the way so much more convenient than actually having to negotiate with people you dont like so im starting to think alex steffens and cory doctorows notion of an outquisition has something to it or more specifically the notion of eco tech community safe havens where the enthusiasts of post industrial technology can cultivate it in a progressive environment this is largely the same thing marshal savage was proposing in the aquarius phase of tmp he felt that in order to accelerate the cultivation of a potentially space faring culture a kind of post industrial culture by default one needed to put people in a situation and location that compelled them to pursue efficiency environmental sustainability and industrial self sufficiency by any technological means as a way of life and as preparation for living beyond earth he chose the sea as a logical place to do that because its the next best thing to being in space and it insulates one from the instant material gratification of mainland markets forcing you to figure out how to make what you need or want in new ways its not as immediately deadly a place as space but its not as benign or homogenously rich with resources as the new world was so it challenges you to be smarter you can live very comfortably luxuriously but not the same way you would on land as jules vernes captain nemo pointed out so aquarius is intended to create a kind of new largely ignored country on the equator where an eco tech culture is independently cultivated to the point where one day as savage put it it comes to the poker table of the world market like a player with a fire hose spewing chips up his sleeve i tend to be of the opinion that we can also cultivate this new country in a subversive way in the midst of the existing habitat this is an option the internet has given us coordinated activity on a global scale through virtual community weve now got this ability to create very tight social groups and coherent sub cultural movements independent of location but as you note theres a real problem of how to turn the efforts of virtual communities into anything real to go beyond intellectual products to things that constitute a physical habitat this is a question ive long struggled with in the luf because the millennial projects presents us with a very similar question how do you turn the activity of a globally dispersed community of people linked only by internet communications into the single largest space program in history

8253345 said john walsh mda dataquick president the median price paid for a southland home was 348 000 last month down 2 0 percent from 355 000 in june and down 31 1 percent from 505 000 for july 2007 that peak of 505 000 was reached in march april may and july of last year the median has fallen because of depreciation especially in inland markets and because of the steep drop off in home financing in the so called jumbo category which until recently was defined as loans above 417 000 before the credit crunch hit in august 2007 nearly 40 percent of southland sales were financed with jumbo loans jumbos last month accounted for 15 8 percent of southland sales
8253346 of course he is buying hes the only one left with money

8253396 we did a spy movie because we hadnt done one before
8253397 we could have done a dog movie or an outer space movie but we ended up doing this theres no conscious pattern
8253398 we just wanted to do something with these specific people

8253401 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8253402 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8253403 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8253404 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8253405 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8253408 i still vividly remember seeing this piece of article a couple of months back in a newspaper and soon after that i was lost in the pros and cons of this critical decision being an ex student of nitt i started thinking about the effect of this move on nits in general
8253409 i think the article is trying to highlight the fact that one ought to check
8253410 self confessed mastermind of the september 11 attacks on the us
8253411 i think the article is trying to highlight the fact that one ought to check
8253412 i think the article is trying to highlight the fact that one ought to check
8253413 people were killed and theyre building on top of their bones
8253414 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
8253415 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
8253416 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
8253417 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 of the total
8253418 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery
8253419 we think august 29 should be holy day not a day for business as usual
8253420 the mayor announced to the world that new orleans was open for business but were here to tell you that it is closed for families

8253423 within the context of russian peacekeeping efforts in the region known as the joint control commission
8253424 georgia began moving troops toward tshkhinvali a few hours after the south ossetians agreed to a russian mediated cease fire
8253425 south ossetias leader accused georgia of treachery but the georgian government claimed its troops were responding to rebel attacks on georgian villages
8253426 russian peacekeepers did everything to make the georgian side stop firing mortars grenade launchers and large caliber weapons on the city of tskhinvali
8253427 but the firing didnt cease and we were forced to return fire we will now do our best to suppress this
8253428 they came up with a new method they shoot at us from civilian objects from schools and hospitals so that in case of return fire that causes damages they can present it as a barbarian act by the georgians
8253429 georgians said the separatists shelled them georgian villages all day on the 7th
8253430 i think the article is trying to highlight the fact that one ought to check
8253431 the debts of governments federal state and local corporations farmers home mortgages and consumer commercial and financial debts
8253432 the consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work something that requires debt to increase
8253433 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8253434 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8253435 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
8253436 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
8253437 i think the article is trying to highlight the fact that one ought to check
8253438 historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades
8253439 give great apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas the right to life freedom from arbitrary captivity and protection from torture
8253440 we argue that hes a person and hes capable of owning something himself as opposed to being owned and that he can manage his money this means he can start a court case against baxter which at the very least should mean his old age pension is secure
8253441 project human projects onto animals to look for and find or not find ourselves in them
8253442 what they want from us if anything other than to be let alone and what it will take to learn the answer

8253453 to allow chimpanzees to be removed from the retirement facility
8253454 dr strandberg from the nih is going to testify that the nih cant support this legislation because it would make the animals permanently unavailable for study or monitoring expand upon that what is your feeling there how strongly do you feel about their not being available for invasive research procedures
8253455 well i think the most important thing here is can they be left in the sanctuary and there are certain procedures even over and above taking blood which could be carried out

8253465 hes kicked open the doors hes broken the rules hes made clear that you can actually make a commercially viable documentary film
8253466 we dont bring movies to this festival that are mediocre or arent very good or it was a nice try or whatever
8253467 i think most documentary filmmakers nowadays are michael moore disciples
8253468 i thought oh my god this is great so fresh so original
8253469 there was no daily show back then no jon stewart
8253470 michael did things on camera no one was doing said things no one was saying i was determined to get a job on that show and by golly i did
8253471 our work with michael was always about exposing government and corporate accountability
8253472 this film shows how the government failed miserably but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8253473 those of us who work with michael believe in a lot of the same things the desire to look at things in a different way to look at issues that arent in the mainstream media
8253474 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories
8253475 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar

8253504 i guess my second hope is that for each one of them as individuals that they can do something unique or special so that when they graduate they are feeling good about their diploma fairport and themselves

8253915 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8253916 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8253917 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8253918 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and tsvangirai form a transitional government

8253933 i think what happened was three years ago we played a football game and it was horrendous it was rain rain and more rain it was just terrible we had a band show the next day and the field was trashed

8253947 technische opleidingen en beroepen kampen met een afkalvende of stagnerende instroom vooral van meisjes heel wat onderzoeken wijzen bovendien uit dat jongeren niet bijzonder ge nteresseerd zijn in techniek
8253948 de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt aan ingenieurs wetenschappers en technici neemt alsmaar toe
8253949 meer dan de helft van de jongeren die zouden kunnen kiezen voor een wetenschappelijke studierichting of ingenieursopleiding doen dit niet
8253950 bij de keuze van een studierichting laten jongeren zich nog te weinig leiden door hun eigen interesses en talenten
8253951 doordat kinderen er in het lager onderwijs weinig of niet mee in aanraking komen weten ze bij de studiekeuze niet of een technische richting hen zou liggen

8253958 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
8253959 that is why we are putting measures in place to support industry including more funding to buy unsold homes
8253960 at the same time we are taking action to support the small minority of borrowers who may be facing difficulties because of current market conditions
8253961 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort

8254010 an injury can really slow down a young athlete and its very difficult for athletes in general to come back after an injury
8254011 what you want to do is make sure that your kid does other activities that are still allowing him to be active but not using the affected joint or leg thats been injured
8254012 look for swelling in the joint look for a limp look for them changing their technique in their sport if you see any of these things despite what the child tells you they may be hurting

8254024 with all of our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8254025 the work of the belfast city council community safety wardens patrolling with the police in finaghy on certain dates helps but it can only go so far in tackling the problem
8254026 we need consistency there needs to be a multi agency approach working against this anti social behaviour all the time so that its nipped in the bud when it happens
8254027 make no mistake this weapon was brought into the park with the intent to cause real harm
8254028 the lives of residents living nearby are being made a living hell by the young people gathering there over the weekend and it is only going to get worse
8254029 we want to advise local residents not to approach these teens but to contact the police or get in contact with us as we can liaise with the police on their behalf
8254030 at this time we understand that arrangements are being made to hand into police an offensive weapon that is believed to have been found in the park over the weekend by a member of the public
8254031 police have been working closely with residents community groups and belfast city councils parks department in the finaghy area in relation to issues surrounding woodlands park and in particular anti social behaviour in the area we will continue to work with all those who have a positive contribution to make and would encourage anyone with information about any specific incident to come forward to police immediately
8254032 neglect of the blackstaff river through culverting and illegal dumping
8254033 the culvert gates at the glenmachen place section of the blackstaff river are regularly blocked with all sorts of debris mattresses rubbish and even furniture
8254034 had the gates been blocked on the day of the floods the water would have flooded nearby houses in village which used to happen regularly in the past
8254035 the unculverted section of the blackstaff river which runs alongside the boucher road never floods were calling on the planning service to give assurances that the remainder of the blackstaff river will stay unculverted and asking the rivers agency that the blackstaff will be regularly dredged of debris
8254036 the blackstaff river is inspected and maintained on a regular basis to reduce the risk of flooding additional inspections are made in times of heavy rainfall and maintenance carried out if required
8254037 the grille on the inlet to the culvert at glenmachan pass is currently inspected and maintained by a contractor as part of the west link improvement scheme in addition rivers agency carries out regular inspections of the culvert and liaises with the contractor as necessary to ensure maintenance is of an acceptable standard
8254038 as susan points out i had no expectation of being considered because i was a strong supporter of hillary clinton
8254039 it starts with public specualtion by people who really dont know whats going on
8254040 were going to cast a wide net and look at a number of people but there were only a handful that merit serious consideration and i think youre one of them
8254041 so i said that i would be honored to be considered then my take on this brian is that to get to the final two or three obviously youve got to have some pretty good things that recommend you or you dont get there and obviously you cant have too many negative things otherwise you dont get there
8254042 when you get to that point it just becomes what the particular dynamics of the campaign happen to be we had two or three really good people and it was a question of who happened to fit their needs at that particular time best thats the way it is dick lugar has been in this position and my father has been in this position they performed great public service for our state so im pretty philosophical about it
8254043 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8254044 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8254045 i expect to see her honor the supporters who are still arguing honor their passion and the amazing work they did
8254046 i also expect shell talk about how important it is to get behind barack obama now i expect shell point out to them why theyre democrats that theyre democrats for a reason at the end of the day the democratic party and barack obama still stand for things like a womans right to choose i hope those who are holding out will see what a travesty it would be to actually pull the r lever
8254047 but the fact is when you lose an election the party should back the winner and move forward
8254048 im a strong democrat but i also feel strongly that i need to show my support for hillary clinton here at the convention
8254049 and i think barack obama would respect that decision as well i will vote for barack obama in the fall
8254050 why else wouldnt these democrats get behind the democratic nominee
8254051 the delegates were early and the fire marshal was challenged they had to finally shut the doors to prevent any more folks from entering the center because of senator hillary rodham clinton
8254052 the time is now to unite the party with a single purpose and time to elect barrack obama president of the united states
8254053 while we clinton delegates were very passionate about our candidate were democrats we see that unity in the party and supporting barack obama is whats best for the party and whats best for the country
8254054 i sit with folks from my community colleagues from the legislature
8254055 that doesnt mean i have to vote for her thats a misconception
8254056 i was elected a hillary clinton delegate internally by the party folks that has nothing to do with indiana or my district for that matter
8254057 this is the interesting thing those of us who voted for her in the primary which i did now are kind of like on one hand saying i support hillary clinton i think shes an inspiring figure but shes not going to be the nominee and as most people would expect me to say any democrat would be better than john mccain
8254058 anyone can agree barack obama is special unique and this is going to be a historical event im proud to be part of that
8254059 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
8254060 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball
8254061 my favorite player when i was a kid was dr j he had those old nets shorts with the socks up to here
8254062 im a chicago guy so im thinking walter payton sweetness that guy had durability he could block as well as run
8254063 id like to see the baseball commissioner handle this without congress being involved weve got a lot of stuff on our plate
8254064 oh thats easy white sox you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side
8254065 people trust her and shes got a very good political mind
8254066 im fortunate enough i can come home on weekends to wash clothes check on my fish see my family
8254067 there is a great need for after school programming in our community
8254068 it looks like our percent of poverty improved a bit so it looks like were a little better off than the statewide numbers
8254069 students must take these opportunities seriously and schools must use test data in making improvements to their curriculum and instructional practices
8254070 i was just trying to find out if i was doing my job right
8254071 their job will be to say no until whoevers appealing for special treatment proves theyve done everything they can do for themselves
8254072 if we get a major fire we would not be able to handle it
8254073 weve had litigation e mails conversation and everything in between

8254083 these young people showed wanton disregard of the good name of their area never mind the safety of the people who were passing through at the time
8254084 it is just unacceptable and very very regrettable that what was a small number of young people have caused this damage
8254085 there were no reports of any injuries and traffic was diverted away from a number of areas for a time
8254086 last year was a bit of an experiment but we were really encouraged by the community support and felt it was time to pull out all the stops to create a fun context for new conversations about shared spaces

8254094 as europe we are 10 times richer than russia and along with the united states 20 times
8254095 id prefer if russia worked together and integrated itself with the wider known west but if it comes to confrontation then it will lose again
8254096 heads of france germany the us turkey and ukraine have been in russia
8254097 poland shouldnt be the only nation that doesnt speak with its neighbour i think that russia should also care for dialogue with a nation thats now listened to on eastern matters more carefully than ever before

8254100 i dont know about you guys but this past weekend was jjjjjeeeeeaaaaahhhhh hahaha the reason why it was so awesome was that lil wayne the best rapper alive did a concert at the oconnell center in gainesville the best concert i have ever been to it was so so tight well first fabolous opened up the concert which was tight then lil wayne came on later and i must say jeah me and my two best friends we had front row seats exactly in the middle it was insane my legs hurt still from jumping up and down hahaha i had my grillz in my new paul watch i got i was iced out to the fullest
8254101 i originally tried to start with aphex twins windowlicker but trying to mix that with its off kilter time signatures on my decrepit cd players was categorically not happening so it starts off with a cool rocky electro tune from the afghan raiders before going into proper guitar territory with the presets and the whip it then gets a little cut up thanks to patrick alavi and the brilliant 20 fingers before the mix starts becoming all about the bass lines from fake blood to herve theyre all energetic party tunes that are guaranteed to get you dancing and it all closes on a beautifully epic number thanks to the very up and coming duke dumont theyre mostly pretty fresh tunes with a few classics like trash and fancy footwork thrown in there which is something dubai doesnt get much of and i hope they make you dance like no ones watching thats what music should do right

8254126 hay errores hay omisiones hay insuficiencias y hay consecuencias de una acumulaci n de muchos a os de indolencia o corrupci n ante el c ncer del crimen y sobre esta base este crimen ha podido enquistarse en muchos rdenes y comunidades de nuestra geograf a hasta ser vista como algo normal como parte de nuestra vida cotidiana
8254127 pero no hay otra opci n que enfrentar el crimen organizado para rescatar a los mexicanos que viven en las entidades donde el narcotr fico se ha enquistado
8254128 se ha alimentado de la tolerancia y en ocasiones de la franca corrupci n de algunas autoridades aunque tambi n de la indiferencia y de la apat a de muchos ciudadanos
8254129 reformar las leyes es un paso necesario pero no suficiente en el camino hacia un m xico m s seguro tengo muy claro que la inseguridad y la violencia no pueden ser erradicadas por mero decreto
8254130 la sociedad se encuentra profundamente agraviada por la impunidad y por la corrupci n s que estos males se hacen m s dif ciles de combatir si falta coordinaci n suficiente entre las autoridades
8254131 haciendo a un lado nuestras diferencias pol ticas ideol gicas o partidistas
8254132 todos tenemos que algo qu aportar en la lucha por hacer de m xico un pa s donde impere la ley
8254133 i like video games toys model comics book everything this is kidult
8254134 mix the imagination world and the real world this is kidult
8254135 a skeleton surfing on a wave of human bodies all the bodies of all the people that the united states army has ever subjugated throughout history
8254136 the holy spirit intervenes in our favor by appearing to cardinals who had been wavering in their support of you earn forty cardinal votes
8254137 men who are narcissistic thrill seekers also have more sex
8254138 i saw a toy its a robot but my mom she never buy it for me at that moment the toy was 150 hong kong dollars now its 5 300 forty times as much i still buy it why is it forty times expensive because of the kidult market
8254139 the more we dug into beauchamps writings the more clear it became that we might have been in the realm of war stories a genre notoriously rife with embellishment
8254140 who told stories about them all trying to have sex with donkeys when they were younger a costeno cutsom apparently
8254141 how a gang of right wing shitheads strip mined the government while managing to sell out every last one of their dumbshit principles
8254142 marching for peace while paying for war is like pigging out on junk food while praying for health
8254143 they entered the village and called all the peasants together tortured them to make them say who were terrorists and killed them because they didnt talk
8254144 they didnt shoot or do anything to us and all of a sudden i saw lieutenant telmo hurtado opening fire on them then he threw in a grenade and smoke starting coming out of the house
8254145 lieutenant telmo hurtado shot the victims to finish them off
8254146 after hurtado put all the people in one house he tossed in a grenade but since they didnt all die he started to finish them off with his gun and ordered that the house be burnt down
8254147 thats when a woman appeared and the lieutenant gave orders that she be shot but they didnt hit her on his orders sergeant managua ran after the woman he shot at her twice and missed but he killed her on the third shot
8254148 informed then army major jos williams zapata of everything that happened
8254149 lieutenant hurtado told us that accomarca was a red zone that we shouldnt lose sight of each other because if we did we would be killed
8254150 they told us that the area was dominated by sendero luminoso and that we had to attack those people
8254151 i only remember that it was a major whose last name was zapata
8254152 five women were stripped naked submerged in water and interrogated
8254153 all of the soldiers in my patrol unit and soldiers in other units collected the spent shells at the army base hurtado told us to keep quiet because we were all implicated
8254154 contreras said his patrol unit went out the day after the massacre to clean up the area and that jos williams zapata was aware of this that means the officer had immediate knowledge of the execution of the victims
8254155 indeed it was the political military chief wilfredo mori who authorised the patrols especially the ones carried out by compa a lince
8254156 voc fulana que sou eu precisa ser menos vaidosa menos orgulhosa e tal

8254158 wow i guess this dream is coming true my grandparents who taught me to write and type and dream i am so proud of all your hard work today even if this is a long long sad book but some funny too just like those black and white movies in the heat of the eastern seaboard rolling through the windows of our home
8254159 martin luther king is getting dressed in the morning coretta scott king is dusting his shoulders off hes about to go out the dude waiting in the car im him i dont know if im his homie im just gonna drive him to where hes going and im gonna talk to him then he came with the track when we heard that beat we went nuts i immediately wrote three verses
8254160 so many people tried to take that record off the album this record is a hip hop must that record never can say goodbye and angel those are the meat and potatoes of what hip hop is about
8254161 i dont even believe i be writing sh like that sometimes when im in the zone man im in the zone
8254162 i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scotts teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f in head shot i wonder why jesse jackson didnt catch him before his body drop would he give me the answer probably not
8254163 jesse jackson all the things hes done great for our people you commend him for it but jesse jackson was wrong for what he did
8254164 i wanted to expose a little of his dark side dont forget he had a baby out of wedlock awhile back everybody is imperfect but when you do something like that disrespect a situation thats affecting us all on an everyday basis people like me with voices gotta step in
8254165 jesse jackson is always in pictures with martin luther king and hes always talking about martin luther king in his speeches
8254166 on the day king got shot he wasnt there editors note jackson was present at the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee when king was assassinated in april 1968 but he was not on the balcony with king when he was shot when i say how come you couldnt catch your mans body when it dropped its because you couldnt if you wanted to you was somewhere else you claimed to be his man where were you that day
8254167 this is one of my favourite places in the world
8254168 ive been trying to get into a coen brothers film for many years so when they called i was very happy
8254169 but when they said the part had been hand written for me i wasnt sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8254170 after this george said thats it ive played my last idiot
8254171 we did a spy movie because we hadnt done one before
8254172 we could have done a dog movie or an outer space movie but we ended up doing this theres no conscious pattern
8254173 we just wanted to do something with these specific people
8254174 i think the stars there should be the people whove been elected
8254175 as it happens im getting married and having children today
8254176 were thrilled and excited to be in the parc management family
8254177 well continue with our nascar affiliation and things will only get better for us and our customers
8254178 the nascar speedparks deliver a key ingredient in parc managements operating philosophy they provide a quality value priced entertainment option that families can enjoy together
8254179 we want each of our parks to contribute to the economic health of the community they serve and offer an affordable place for our guests team members and their neighbors to engage in clean safe leisure pursuits
8254180 our team is thrilled to include myrtle waves water park and the five nascar speedparks in the parc management family
8254181 and we look forward to working to enhance guests experience
8254182 it kind of reminds us that this is something canadians take very very seriously and businesses and retailers need to take it seriously as well
8254183 increase their wait time if they felt compassion or apologies were offered for the wait
8254184 different parts of canada respond differently to surveys but in this one it was all the same
8254185 our policy regarding equal opportunities and team orders is well known
8254186 we always aim to hire the two best drivers available and we always then aim to give them equal opportunities to optimise their chances to win grands prix and world championships
8254187 sometimes that policy has been criticised by those who believe that a policy of running a number one driver supported by a number two driver with or without team orders is a better strategy
8254188 well we dont accept that we exist to win and all our employees including all our drivers buy in to that
8254189 heikki is doing a fabulous job this year as his recent victory at the hungaroring showed only too clearly hes a pleasure to have in our team and he and lewis have a very good relationship with each other
8254190 his pioneering spirit brought skiing to this area before aviemore
8254191 it is absolutely right to recognise the history of the hotel but in the cold light of day it is obviously bringing down the whole end of that part of the street
8254192 in a way there is some sadness at the loss of a hotel but we also have to recognise that carrbridge has some very high quality tourist businesses
8254193 i am obviously very pleased this means we can press on with the next stage and get the building warrant we will possibly be able to start work later this year this is a significant project for carrbridge
8254194 we have been worried about being attached to a deteriorating building
8254195 to have an empty building just sitting there is wrong
8254196 when i saw the first set of plans they were very sympathetic they are keeping the front as it is and that is the bit everyone wanted
8254197 ok all those with drivers licences come show us how you drive these brooms across the courtyard
8254198 ok all those with girlfriends come carry these barrels over to the stores and treat them as gently as you would your girlfriend
8254199 ok all you rugby players come rugby tackle these trash bins and go empty them out

8254207 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8254208 of the people by the people and for the people
8254209 managing the bewildered masses is the responsibility of the few rich and mighty who must bear this burden for the sake of humanity
8254210 when shes 16 she will get my clothes all those pucci numbers and things that i wore when i was 17 that i wont really wear but im saving them for her really thats my blackmail dont eat your dinner and you wont get my clothes you wont grow and you wont get into my clothes now shes a fashion freak
8254211 id met kim but i really got to know her in our wrestling scene theres hair pulling and i hurt my back and got some burn marks but its also sexy were sort of playing with the idea that guys get turned on by girls wrestling we get into some down and dirty positions so its a good thing we became friends kim is so cool not to mention being hot
8254212 ive sort of created that image but its definitely a part of who i am one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in mini skirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels

8254215 i know this is a significant historical event but why remind ourselves of military defeat that ushered in such disastrous consequences
8254216 the only way we wont make money in these stocks is if the companies dont make it through this cycle
8254217 its hard to think the housing market wont recover eventually and that homebuilding stocks wont get back to profitability
8254218 they have a long way to go before they can even put a dent in their decline
8254219 if you look at them on a long term basis the homebuilders are great values
8254220 with sufficient access to capital and plenty of cash on the balance sheet
8254221 toll brothers has strengthened its balance sheet so much that the market knows its clearly a survivor
8254222 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8254223 people with als maybe able to move their mouth a little but they cant exhale enough air from their lungs to produce audible speech but since the speech signals are produced by the brain even if they cannot speak we can intercept those signals and create the speech for them

8254226 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8254227 one of the greatest threats to effective environmental progress is asking the public to bear the cost of environmental actions that later turn out to be unnecessary or unsupported by current science such errors erode the political will to do the hard and necessary environmental tasks think of the current credibility of the fda for example after it erroneously labeled tomatoes as the salmonella culprit davis is in danger of sliding down this slippery slope in instituting a total ban on wood burning when the science is not supportive of such an action
8254228 there are two problems one is that the city of davis natural resources commission did not have key documents that have actually determined the surprisingly low levels of wood smoke in davis in winter a 55 page report submitted to the city council in march 15 1995 this work shows that even in the worst stagnation periods davis represents a tiny enhancement over the valleywide winter particulate pollution which is largely caused by diesels and smoking cars in addition for the past month we have been breathing smoke from the much more dangerous wildfires at levels roughly 100 to 200 times what which we saw during our worst stagnation period the cold hazy day in davis on dec 23 1995 yet glennah trochet m d sacramento countys health officer noted no increases in doctors visits or hospital admissions from the present wood smoke even in the worst period of mid to late june 2008
8254229 cahill made three claims that are unfortunately not substantiated by the older data he presented nor accepted by the larger scientific community
8254230 firstly cahill implies that wood smoke is not as harmful as suspected or represented
8254231 secondly cahill further claims his own research shows wood smoke concentrations are at
8254232 anderson said the ysaqmd should be responsible for regulating wood burning it would be my dream to just leave it to the yolo solano air quality realm and not bring it into local politics because thats what theyre there for she said
8254233 well be building the classroom pod and gym up until the snow flies
8254234 were hoping to be seeing athletes there by mid september from minerva deland and the high school
8254235 balanced literacy works with our kids who are struggling and with our kids who are flying like jets
8254236 we know all too well that reading and writing doesnt just take place in english it takes place in a science lab or a math class its at the core of science and math skills
8254237 i guess my second hope is that for each one of them as individuals that they can do something unique or special so that when they graduate they are feeling good about their diploma fairport and themselves
8254238 it gets a little lonely around here in the summer so its nice to have the students back
8254239 i just hope they have a fabulous year and we can help them achieve their goals as they finish their high school careers
8254240 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8254241 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8254242 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8254251 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
8254252 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8254253 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary

8254258 a the good old days being in groups its really sad how they make shuffle groups that dont last very long
8254259 nee yui chan wouldnt it be great to be in a group together reina chan too
8254260 we droomden allang van een tweede leven ver weg van onze drukke jobs en de daarbij horende stress files en deadlines
8254261 een gastenverblijf openen in het buitenland leek ons de ideale oplossing op onze reizen hebben we heel wat prachtige plaatsen ontdekt maar ook dikwijls ondervonden we dat het cultuurverschil een barri re vormde uiteindelijk besloten we onze pijlen dichterbij te richten op europa zo botsten we anderhalf jaar geleden op een unieke aanbieding in het spaanse hu scar een reeks casas cueva rustieke woningen uitgehouwen in de rotsen typisch voor de streek deze grotwoningen werden al gebruikt door de moren in de middeleeuwen en deden later dienst als schuil en slaapplaats voor herders en hun schapen een idyllische en allesbehalve alledaagse setting mooier konden we het niet dromen toen bovendien bleek dat de omgeving heel wat faciliteiten voor vakantiegangers bood wisten we dat we ons nieuwe thuis hadden gevonden
8254262 overnachten in een grot is een onvergetelijke ervaring de rust en privacy zijn compleet en bovendien slaap je door het ontbreken van daglicht erg lang en diep ideaal voor wie de batterijen eens helemaal wil opladen ook de constante temperatuur binnenshuis het hele jaar tussen 18 en 20 graden is een troef in de zomer geniet je van de koelte in de winter maak je s avonds de open haard aan en is het gezellig cocoonen

8254517 great design is not always about recreating the wheel instead we identified and built on those elements in todwils existing collateral that visually conveyed its intrinsic qualities and which captured the energy of this dynamic business that is moving with the times the result is a fresh and completely professional look that will stand the company in good stead for another 61 years
8254518 typography and colour are the primary design elements in that we avoided a separate icon or logo to create a modern simple yet sophisticated unfussy and bold design vernacular for todwil weve furthermore selected the finest quality materials and finishes available but juxtaposed them for a sense of drama or element of surprise for example we used metallic foiling against high matt with high gloss finish on the reverse this tactile identity is representative of the quality materials todwil uses in the manufacturing of its products
8254519 fountainhead has created a premium identity that represents the premium quality of work that we produce the design embraces our company ethos in that it conveys our energy superbly through the use of bold colours and superior materials in a simple yet sophisticated layout were one of the leaders in retail marketing and point of sale communication as our turnover attests this fresh new look helps us communicate our success as a company more effectively

8254547 while it is too early to predict the real impact of the credit crunch on scottish football this sounder financial footing with reduced debt and more affordable wage structures should help the majority of clubs to weather any financial storms as a result of a down turn
8254548 potentially one of the biggest impacts in 2008 09 will not be a decline in ordinary supporters buying tickets many are expected to continue juggling finances to ensure they dont miss any matches but in the corporate sector where sponsorship and support is discretionary and may be cut back if budgets have to be prioritised or shareholders pile on pressure

8254713 the crusader zionist campaign has nothing left besides roaming the sea for more than a year one after the other armed battalions off the beaches of yemen have started to hunt commercial vessels tourism vessels and oil tankers in the current phase it has become a necessity to the mujahideen in conducting a global campaign to restore the islamic caliphate and to rule the world through it the next step is to control the sea and ports starting with those surrounding the arabian peninsula it becomes necessary to develop the battle to include the sea and as the mujahideen have managed to form martyrs brigades on the ground the sea remains the next strategic step toward ruling the world and restoring the islamic caliphate the beaches of yemen are considered the links between the arabian sea and the gulf of aden the latter overlooks the strait of bab al mandab in the red sea and the indian ocean this region represents a strategic point to expel the enemy from the most important pillars of its battle if it is unable to protect itself in this strategic region then it cannot protect itself on the ground and its naval bases under the blows of the mujahideen

8254771 our goal is to try to improve the forecast of severe weather as opposed to the daily forecast of weather that might disrupt a softball game but its not really going to tear your house down
8254772 you are watching the hurricane move towards the coast and you think oh its making landfall down by savannah georgia and i live in myrtle beach so im clear and then bam you get hit by a tornado
8254773 they happen a lot and people are caught unaware across the carolinas in 2004 and 2005 alone there were over 130 tornadoes in association with just seven tropical cyclones none of which actually made landfall on the north carolina coast it was just the remnants moving through its a fairly important forecast issue for our area
8254774 the traditional conceptual model is that the individual storms that comprise the hurricane rain bands are ordinary over the ocean and the increase in surface friction over land creates the miniature supercells
8254775 what we have been finding is that you can actually have these miniature supercells form out over the ocean and then produce tornados on or very near the beach
8254776 we are trying to provide proof of concept through high density observations
8254777 ultimately if we can understand what causes the supercell out over the open ocean then we can help forecasters to detect them earlier with radar and give everyone a little more forewarning
8254778 the question is can i help you and the unfortunate answer is no
8254779 i cant give you a range of numbers i cant tell you want is reasonable or unreasonable
8254780 i want you to appreciate all the effort thats gone into trying this case by the parties the plaintiff and the defense
8254781 if we have to try this case over the next jury that listens to the case is not going to do a better job and will not be more qualified to do the job than you folks

8254825 someone pointed out to her that it was her choice to do that but that she was putting everyones kids in jeopardy by not having her kids vaccinated
8254826 i have no problem welcoming unvaccinated children into a play group and i have no problem with them attending school
8254827 simply put my children are vaccinated the risk is minimal i may not agree with other parents choices but theres no reason to hold that against the child
8254828 from the vaccinating parent perspective its a little infuriating because you dont know who these kids are

8254853 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
8254854 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds
8254855 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8254856 declines in the present situation index both in terms of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

8254928 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8254929 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8254930 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8254931 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8254932 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8254933 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8254934 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8254935 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8254936 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8254937 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8254938 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8254939 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8254940 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8254941 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8254942 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8254943 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8254944 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8254945 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8254946 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8254947 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8254948 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8254949 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8254950 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8254951 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8254952 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8254953 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8254954 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8254955 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8254956 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8254957 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8254958 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane

8255063 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8255064 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8255065 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8255066 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8255067 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8255068 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8255069 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8255070 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8255071 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8255072 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations

8255075 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8255076 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8255077 in manchester the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8255078 throughout the week they people all work so hard then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8255079 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8255080 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8255081 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8255082 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8255083 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8255084 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8255085 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8255086 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8255087 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8255088 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8255089 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8255090 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8255091 i want the chairman of nice to come down and speak to these people i want him to look in to the eyes of the people whose lives he would cut short
8255092 it has kept me alive for two years im living proof that this drug works
8255093 it is absolutely imperative that other people are given these drugs it needs to be available to everyone who has a clinical need for it
8255094 it needs to be decided by consultants and not by the accountants at nice
8255095 it has made me feel more like my old self and ive only been on it for three weeks last week i went shopping for the first time in eight months thats how well im feeling
8255096 i am here to support all these people i feel very angry about what nice are doing
8255097 my professor and other professors have said how good this drug is
8255098 lots of people have worked hard and put money in to the country and now they cant get it i never thought i would see the day when this country would do that
8255099 in my letter to nice i said they were condemning kidney cancer patients to an early death
8255100 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8255101 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8255102 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8255103 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8255104 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8255105 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8255106 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8255107 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8255108 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8255109 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8255110 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8255111 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8255112 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8255113 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8255114 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8255115 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8255116 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8255117 wash your cloths here and they stay clean for 10 years

8255128 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8255129 all of us driven by the simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8255130 and that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope and you see that is why i love this country

8255132 by voting yes on proposition 58 you are basically taking the credit cards cutting them up and throwing them away so that the politicians over there at the capitol those big spenders will never ever get the state into this kind of trouble again

8255138 does not use the phrase war on terrorism more remarkably he doesnt mention islam much less islamic extremism which mr bush has described as a critical ideological threat to freedom inside and outside the muslim world
8255139 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it is fundamentally different
8255140 there has been a shift in islam that i believe is connected to the failures of governments and the failures of the west to work with many of these countries in order to make sure that opportunities are there that theres bottom up economic growth
8255141 failures of the west to work with many of these countries
8255142 but what we also want to do is to shrink the pool of potential recruits and that involves engaging the islamic world rather than vilifying it and making sure that we understand that not only are those in islam who would resort to violence a tiny fraction of the islamic world but that also the islamic world itself is diverse

8255190 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8255191 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8255192 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8255193 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8255194 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8255195 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses

8255209 one run after the catch i think hes gotten better with his speed and athletic ability after he catches the ball
8255210 the other area i thought he really improved in the spring is in the blocking area of it hes become more physical hes got to improve on the blocking to become an all around tight end for us
8255211 for a big kid he could really run and when you threw him the ball he caught it
8255212 for me i want to do anything to help the team
8255213 the players change and when you get to the professional level its nice to be at a higher level of talent
8255214 but yeah the game is there when a pitcher starts to struggle you wonder if you give him time before talking to him get the bullpen ready the flow is pretty understandable
8255215 but its nice being able to help them out i dont mind the travel but when you do a lot of it it starts to wear you out
8255216 usually theyll be injury free for a while and then just like this like when we brought in edgard clemente and the second day here he pulls a hip flexor muscle pitchers you know are struggling because theyre getting overused a bit as the bullpen wears thin it seems to go in waves like that
8255217 they needed a field and they were going to use the school field at southern vermont
8255218 they asked if i wanted to be involved and i thought it would be just as trainer
8255219 no pretty much after i got done with coaching its just a little different with kids
8255220 the talents good its just sometimes the attitudes are a little different they play like they think theyre in the bigs my aspirations are done ive hung up my cleats
8255221 in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8255231 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three preseason games theres a lot of work we have to do
8255232 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8255233 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8255234 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8255235 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8255236 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8255237 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8255238 i guess especially in preseason we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8255239 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8255240 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8255241 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8255242 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8255243 so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means
8255244 we dont want to give the message that there are no connections
8255245 this is perhaps the tentative upside of a recession you gotta learn to do more with less you gotta live more within your means trim fat scale back bike and walk and recycle and maybe just maybe begin to become just slightly more aware

8255293 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8255294 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8255295 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8255296 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force
8255297 its absurd and disingenuous for the obama campaign to say we are running this ad they are trying to blame us and use a straw man to take this issue off the table if he thinks having a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist is not an issue that concerns the american people he is deluding himself or being naive
8255298 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support
8255299 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8255300 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8255301 as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8255302 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8255303 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8255304 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8255305 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions

8255330 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
8255331 yes it is a good idea to encourage employees to improve their health get in shape be fit
8255332 however being overweight even obese is not necessarily linked to ones diet
8255333 this is a situation where the carrot is better than the stick
8255334 assessing a cash penalty for lack of improvement can work but there may not be full buy in of the concept
8255335 many people who are of average weight are afflicted with the kind of medical issues typically associated with obesity
8255336 if the concern is about poor health why not focus on health issues instead of weight
8255337 with health care costs continuing to spiral it was just a matter of time before employers took out the hammer to achieve savings
8255338 this page would rather see incentives that reward healthy behaviors
8255339 there is no denying that when alabama has a population that ranks only second to mississippi in obesity exceptional measures are necessary
8255340 industry says its money is intended solely to keep doctors up to date critics charge that companies agree to support only classes that promote their products

8255342 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it
8255343 when this is all over medical education will not be the same as what its been
8255344 reforms based on transparency can foster accountability and build confidence in medical education and in turn the practice of medicine
8255345 americas pharmaceutical research companies have taken positive steps to help ensure they provide nothing but accurate and balanced information to health care providers
8255346 even though they are prisoners we have to ensure that they can stay healthy and are able to work like anyone else when they return to society
8255347 this is being done simply to save the state money and thats not a good argument for managed care
8255348 this is not about saving money this is about using the money we spend to purchase better quality coverage for medicaid patients
8255349 we used to have 6 500 doctors in medicaid managed care ready to serve the needs of hiv aids patients now we have 13 000 most medicaid fee for service providers serving aids patients are joining managed care networks to continue the doctor patient relationship
8255350 are finding it harder to compete against larger players for many reasons including the need for economies of scale and greater investments in expensive technologies and tools to comply with laws
8255351 very clearly this industry is going to continue to undergo consolidation
8255352 its tough for smaller plans to be able to make the investments to keep up with

8255356 the supreme personality of godhead said it is lust only arjuna which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath and which is the all devouring sinful enemy of this world
8255357 when a living entity comes in contact with the material creation his eternal love for krishna is transformed into lust in association with the mode of passion or in other words the sense of love of god becomes transformed into lust as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt then again when lust is unsatisfied it turns into wrath wrath is transformed into illusion and illusion continues the material existence therefore lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries if therefore the mode of passion instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment

8255363 abbiamo calcolato una spesa media di 1 500 euro per i 5 anni di un liceo classico e di 835 euro per un professionale

8255373 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8255374 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8255375 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will

8255404 the catalog internet business 28 percent of sales and a higher percent of profits is key to j crews operating model as it is not only highly leverageable but also an effective inventory clearing tool
8255405 while pressure on the business due to disruptions in the direct channel from the systems upgrade could be viewed as temporary the company faces too many headwinds in the near term for us to get interested in the stock at the current valuation

8255412 there are more people going to venues and more events held at the mcg

8255430 it seems like there is an insatiable demand for mobile videos in india
8255431 with the first mobile operators in india starting to offer mobile videos now these services are being priced and limited in choice as the operators define and provide the content viewable for their customers our multitude of clips as well as our support of media players like the ipod and the iphone makes our service unique and overwhelming when compared to what is available from operators
8255432 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8255433 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8255434 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8255435 we know that president obama will end the war in iraq responsibly bring our troops home and begin to repair our alliances around the world
8255436 that is why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemate and when hope replaces fear
8255437 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8255438 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8255439 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8255440 please respect his familys grief and privacy at this time
8255441 the company currently sells about 40 million bottles per year
8255442 wendys has been offering 2 fat white and 1 fat chocolate milk but with the move to nesquik both choices will now contain only 1
8255443 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y
8255444 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8255445 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8255446 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8255447 unfortunate that some in the media feel the need to twist every statement to fit a manufactured storyline
8255448 this was a serious discussion about solving some of the worlds most serious problems not party politics anyone who doubts president clintons commitment to electing
8255449 to dinner with three friends two gals and a guy very normal for a saturday
8255450 he came home by himself locked the doors and was going to bed when from what the coroner and detectives could tell he fell
8255451 they think it was a cerebral hemorrhage or a stroke in his head that caused it
8255452 he had nothing significant to drink two beers and didnt take drugs of any sort
8255453 he said im not going to have to go anyplace for a month and he was happy about that
8255454 made me very angry when he referred to the kind of work i did as shock jock something not even my worst enemy would accuse me of
8255455 i have written the judge giving him a resum of my media career and asking that he change that part of the judgment
8255456 you can ask the supreme court to reconsider a decision
8255457 if they make a mistake if they misstate something they now and then issue a correction
8255458 but on a thing like this which is the adjective used
8255459 the rule is that what a court says is absolutely privileged in terms of the court making defamatory statement
8255460 maybe i have more opportunities as a designer over there but im making a bigger statement over here
8255461 in the same way that ralph lauren stands for america chanel for france and versace for italy i want aschobi to stand for african fashion
8255462 the alliance will continue to protest until our demands are met this government has to resign
8255463 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8255464 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8255465 its been a clean race and a very close race if the votes hold up im looking forward to serving the students and the people of polk county
8255466 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients and the community we serve we have a responsibility to lead by example and provide a safe clean and healthy environment
8255467 theres always some folks very happy weve done it and sometimes you get people who want to have a cigarette
8255468 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8255469 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8255470 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8255471 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8255472 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8255473 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently the government newspaper
8255474 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse mr mugabe told the lunch
8255475 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day mr mugabe said
8255476 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said
8255477 hijack the leadership of zimbabwe and said the veteran leader was trying to ride roughshod over his political opponents
8255478 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8255479 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on mr chamisa said
8255480 number two i had the help of wonderful caring people who made a difference all i can say it was the lords will
8255481 anyway the debate on the appropriateness of mandating tanks for new houses will continue but its largely a sideshow on the question of where australias cities will get their water
8255482 i dont know if its compulsory to have the water tank attached to internal plumbing in victoria but that could help
8255483 mindy the problem with that is that you water your garden during dry summers guess what thats when tanks tend to be empty during the water the tank stays full and all the water ends up down the drain i should know thats whats happening to the water in my garden only tank right now
8255484 there is no hope for sensible water policy from an alp state government
8255485 sustainability south east queensland site opening at sustainability directory saving and recycling water with other sites
8255486 queensland water recycling guidelines sec 7 6 using recycled water to supplement drinking water supplies
8255487 if the money that has been invested in water tanks in melbourne had instead been invested in front loading washers and retrofitting high efficiency toilets wed have saved a hell of a lot more water
8255488 some people are doing all three a lot of people are doing the only one that lets them water their garden tank often not plumbed in when the other options would have been far better for them and the environment under a sane water availability and pricing regime

8255500 robert brothers are supposed to want each other to be the most they can be and make the most money they can you on the other hand just sat in judgment of me and were always jealous
8255501 i on the other hand only wished you the best and to win the lottery
8255502 so robert you have a choice you can come to my grave site to say hello out of love or piss on me for not giving you money
8255503 with regard to my estranged family who were never there for myself or my children but always there for their distorted version of catholicism i give and bequeath the sum of 1 each to my
8255504 and request that they donate same to their precious church to whom they had a greater allegiance than to their first child and sister
8255505 and cast over the side of a vessel into the ocean where my body may rest undisturbed by any person s in the deep
8255506 although i recognize that this request may very well violate certain laws of the state of new york and federal as well as multiple other jurisdictions i trust that my executor and friends will ignore same
8255507 this gift is conditioned upon each of them not telling their respective wives of said gift so they may not get their hands on same
8255508 in the event my friends brothers fail to provide me with a burial befitting my character then and in that event i curse each one of them as follows
8255509 to boom boom the electricity never be on when you need it to tr never will any of your radios work again

8255512 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8255513 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8255514 were looking forward to the next little section of this race
8255515 its relaxing that the election is behind me and its rewarding that we accomplished something
8255516 it was painful to do it was not what i wanted to do but we plan to relieve that burden in the future
8255517 sam ran a good race he was the overwhelming pick i hope it is a good four years i wish him all the best

8255551 when you talk of steam people think you are going backwards
8255552 anywhere where you are wasting a lot of heat we can go in capture the heat and turn it into energy savings steam has tremendous power if it can drive a steam locomotive why cant it drive an automotive engine
8255553 there is a lot of heat that is created and totally wasted
8255554 recycling exhaust heat and energy that is rejected from the engine has got to be the way forward in the future
8255555 a tank of petrol or a tank of diesel is such an incredibly good energy store that we have been able to afford to throw some of it away up until now
8255556 any technology that can be gradually introduced like that is a very sensible idea so i think they are doing exactly the right thing
8255557 its a perfectly feasible idea certainly it adds complexity to the engine and therefore cost and i think thats why we havent seen it before
8255558 obviously now with rising oil prices etc it becomes essential to extract more energy from the fuel you are putting in

8255565 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8255566 hillary clinton just gave the most amazing speech it was perfect in every sense
8255567 i have catch phrases now that i will be using to bash any mccain supporter that comes near me in a 10 mile radius
8255568 she proved why she is in a league of her own
8255569 hopefully now the democratic party will move forward unified as one
8255570 mrs clinton gave one of the most brilliant speeches tonight
8255571 although i enjoyed the speech i really thought that hillary should have been a little stronger in her words in support of barack obama
8255572 it was very clear right from the beginning within the first minute of her speech she said im for barack obama
8255573 she said it over and over and over again throughout the speech
8255574 dont believe it when they talk of bitterness there werent any bitter hillary supporters among us
8255575 we all said of course we were going to support our partys candidate sen obama
8255576 its going to be difficult to cast a vote for somebody who i thought made a wrong choice
8255577 if i do vote for obama it will definitely be because sen clinton asked us to do it but its not going to be a joyous vote
8255578 hillary clinton gave her speech and ive got to say it was fantastic she did an amazing job
8255579 she did a very good job of talking to her supporters and winning them over for barack obama
8255580 but i also think that she won a few barack obama supporters as well
8255581 die mannschaft hat im letzten jahr in der champions league gro e leistungen geboten
8255582 eigentlich rechne ich eher in zweieinhalb wochen gegen dortmund mit meinem comeback
8255583 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8255584 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8255585 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8255586 these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8255587 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8255588 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8255589 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8255590 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8255591 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8255592 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8255593 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8255594 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8255595 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8255596 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8255597 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8255598 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8255599 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8255600 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8255601 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8255602 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8255603 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8255604 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8255605 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8255606 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8255607 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8255608 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8255609 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8255610 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8255611 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8255612 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8255613 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8255614 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8255615 i cant really speak for anybody playing or not playing he has his own schedule
8255616 you might have thought he would have known that before he entered or pulled out of here
8255617 i have no idea how he faldo feels i have to perform this week

8255654 its not about rich versus poor young versus old and its not about black versus white its about the past versus the future

8255662 it is not i who arranges who the opposition leader should be
8255663 it is up to the opposition members to choose except for example if there is only one opposition representative in the house then the president of that party will be considered as the leader
8255664 let me tell you honestly it the debates will go on as usual
8255665 i dont see why the opposition is not efficient in this matter unless they are squabbling amongst themselves on who should be the opposition leader
8255666 to me theres nothing unusual in having anwar in the dewan rakyat but i expect decorum maybe he can control opposition mps from going overboard and breaching the standing order

8255678 during her illness there were times when she was not doing well but would bounce back

8255680 i designed this class to be really easy for you guys
8255681 you want it to be so right you want it to be so perfect and you put me on a pedestal and your eyes light up with everything that i do that i know that even if everyone in my life were to turn their back on me you would still see me as the greatest person alive all it has done is infect me i want to be that for you so i push myself to make sure that i am as good a person as you see me to be but it will never be enough and even though you never demand it of me even though you are satisfied with the mere sight of my presence in your vicinity you dont understand what that joy can do to the person that is at the other end of that the torture it causes in them because they know that it will never be enough because the eyes that look at them with that adoration are always so sad because those eyes refelect the the wall that is between them and everyone else they show that you will always be alone even when i have you in my arms and im whispering devotion in your ear

8255689 when you talk of steam people think you are going backwards
8255690 anywhere where you are wasting a lot of heat we can go in capture the heat and turn it into energy savings steam has tremendous power if it can drive a steam locomotive why cant it drive an automotive engine
8255691 there is a lot of heat that is created and totally wasted
8255692 recycling exhaust heat and energy that is rejected from the engine has got to be the way forward in the future
8255693 a tank of petrol or a tank of diesel is such an incredibly good energy store that we have been able to afford to throw some of it away up until now
8255694 any technology that can be gradually introduced like that is a very sensible idea so i think they are doing exactly the right thing
8255695 its a perfectly feasible idea certainly it adds complexity to the engine and therefore cost and i think thats why we havent seen it before
8255696 obviously now with rising oil prices etc it becomes essential to extract more energy from the fuel you are putting in
8255697 list of dudes who have no right to privacy from now on but have no clue
8255698 while cutting back on the use of eco technologies might provide a short term solution to reducing costs it is a short sighted view and makes a mockery of the governments zero carbon target
8255699 understandably in the current climate certain developers will be looking to cut costs but ignoring the benefits of incorporating eco technologies could have disastrous long term consequences
8255700 if simple eco technologies such as solar thermal became integrated into all new homes the reduction in the uks carbon emissions would be considerable further still the unit cost to manufacture these technologies would fall making such technologies more affordable and more accessible for all concerned

8255706 6 you feel as if you are constantly walking on eggshells there is a real degree of fear in the relationship you have come to dread his outbursts the hurtful things that he will find to say to you maybe the same anxiety and need to please spill over into your other relationships also fear is not part of a loving relationship but it is a vital part of a mentally abusive relationship it enables the abuser to maintain control over you 7 you can heal mentally abusive relationships cause enormous emotional damage to the loving partner who tries against all odds to hold the relationship together and ultimately cant do it because his partner is working against him whether you are currently in a mentally abusive relationship have left one recently or years later are still struggling with the anxieties and low self worth and lack of confidence caused by mental abuse it is never too late to heal but you do need to work with a person or a programme specifically geared to mental abuse recovery men who have suffered mental abuse expect radical change of themselves and they expect it right away this is why they often struggle and not uncommonly take up with another abusive partner mental abuse recovery is a gradual process low self worth and limiting beliefs about what kind of future the abuse sufferer can ever hope for are the blocks that can stop women from moving on but they are blocks that you can clear very effectively just as language was once used to harm you you can now learn how language can heal you you can overcome past mental abuse and keep yourself safe from it in the future you can also learn to feel strong believe in yourself and create the life and the relationships you truly want
8255707 you would be better withdrawing 2000 cash from your bank account and burning it in your garden than using the current framework of legal services in scotland because both actions now produce the same result a waste of money and a considerable degree of personal harm

8255779 while we view the long term story as attractive we view the high degree of risk around this key business as a near term offset
8255780 while pressure on the business due to disruptions in the direct channel from the systems upgrade could be viewed as temporary the company faces too many headwinds in the near term for us to get interested in the stock at the current valuation

8255839 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so but there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new the world is often unkind to new talent new creations the new needs friends

8255871 duck could post up from either side make jump hooks with either hand
8255872 we ran a little pick and roll for him a lot he could make the 15 footer from the baseline and he was a much better team defender than people realized because he took up so much room
8255873 when kevin first arrived he was a monster as far as physical size
8255874 he was competition so i scoped him out real well i watched him improve every day through a strong work ethic and finally you look up and say whoa this guy has some serious skills
8255875 im at a loss for words kevin duckworth hes not supposed to be gone so young i loved that guy he was a great teammate one of the best i ever had we were extremely close
8255876 and we got along great for as big a guy as he was he had a very tender heart thats what everybody loved about him
8255877 wed argue hed call me a fool you know how brothers are but everything was done in a loving manner
8255878 he was just a good guy to be around when he talked about hunting and fishing his eyes just lit up he was an easy going fun guy it doesnt matter what you look like on the outside its whats in your heart

8255887 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8255888 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8255889 the feeling around the club after the game was disappointment because the team had played so well in the first half and had chances to win or draw but they didnt the team had two or three good chances to score but couldnt take them
8255890 a lack of concentration was the problem for one of the goals i think in the first half we were very strong much like we had been the last two years in holland and it was just a little mistake in concentration that let arsenal in
8255891 the second leg will of course be difficult for twente it is not impossible but they have to score two of three goals arsenal are a really good team and you dont get too many chances against a team like that even taking last weekend at fulham that doesnt mean anything and arsenal are still a good team and it will always be tough against them
8255892 on the domestic season i think it is an advantage that twente would have played arsenal a couple of times before the league starts on the weekend maybe it is an advantage for arsenal though that they have already played in the premier league before facing twente it means they are in the rhythm to be honest though i dont know what affect it will have
8255893 everybody was impressed by the midfield at twente last season but now both of the players are elsewhere karim el ahmadi left for feyenoord and orlando engelaar went to schalke 04 however you could see in the first leg match in arnhem two weeks ago especially in the players like cheik tiote and theo janssen that the midfield can still be strong but of course engelaar will be missed
8255894 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8255895 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8255896 we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility

8255906 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
8255907 i dont agree with many of the conclusions in the movie
8255908 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
8255909 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8255910 wait isnt this what anyone else in her position would have been saying for the last two months instead of letting this whole rift fester

8255912 never doubt the american consumer they havent let us down for 25 years
8255913 we have a new character known simply as wyatt who is the company guy who is trying to track them this year
8255914 another new character is a hacker named roland our team has learned to have some level of trust among each other or at least they know everyone elses agenda but this is a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily have
8255915 we do learn a little bit this season why michael scofield is so smart this is not sci fi but there is something that is unique about his childhood that leads to why he has the ability to do some of things he can do
8255916 are finally together but like i said there have always been these physical barriers between them he was incarcerated she worked in the prison hospital so obviously theres a barrier he was on the run she was in another part of the country theres a barrier here they are finally able to be together but we are jumping ahead in time so theres that period thats unaccounted for so what happened to her what happened to him and hope they both help each other get past that get past these invisible barriers theres no physical barriers anymore between them but theyre both pretty banged up when they see each other and its about how they get past that to really find that real intimacy theyre all still trying to clear their names avoid jail time avoid death and so theres still that locomotive feel to it storytelling wise and while thats going on on on the fly these two people are trying to save each other
8255917 this was the first chance weve really had to live out our values
8255918 were not just keeping people on the payroll because were nice at the end of all this our hope is that well end up with a more skilled north american work force
8255919 its an expensive proposition toyota wont estimate the financial hit but keeping 4 500 of its workers on the clock at full pay and benefits for 14 weeks even at a conservative estimate of 20 an hour would represent at least 50 million the shutdown also means a production loss of 30 000 to 40 000 big ticket pickups and suvs at an estimated wholesale value of even 25 000 per vehicle that translates into as much as 1 billion in lost revenue other complications are developing toyotas assembly plants that still are producing are leery of others getting an advantage in intra company competition for future work so they are vying to take part in the retraining programs it was ms newton who first received word of toyotas decision last month of the production halt her instructions were clear all affected workers would remain on the clock at full pay until assembly resumes in november no one had developed a contingency plan so that left newton and her kentucky staff with about two weeks of late night meetings and weekend scrambling to create a plan of action their solution move the affected work force through a nonstop schedule of classes and training exercises aimed at improving their assembly skill levels among the classes they are rotating through safety drills productivity improvement exercises presentations on material handling and workplace hazards diversity and ethics classes maintenance education and a stream of online tests to measure and record their skill improvements but just as the plan got under way things became more complicated in toyotas manufacturing system its plants compete for each new vehicle program based on their achievements if one plant gets a leg up on worker skill levels or safety achievements it could sway a future decision on where a new vehicle gets manufactured
8255920 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well

8255951 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8255952 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8255953 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8255954 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8255955 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8255956 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8255957 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to the first month was especially hard i lived alone in a hotel which i left only for training i thought i would go crazy inside those four walls
8255958 nemanja vidic would like to clarify comments attributed to him in several uk newspapers which have either been taken out of context or misquoted
8255959 in the interview the defender did discuss how difficult he found it adapting to life in england including the rain manchester occasionally experiences when he first joined from spartak moscow in january 2006 but he feels compelled to clear up other comments attributed to him in the uk press
8255960 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8255961 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way
8255962 arshavin is a seriously good player he was one of the best when i was in russia
8255963 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england
8255964 i dont like the weather food women in rome barcelona helsinki
8255965 in manchester the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities

8256002 after a couple of months of development and a long delay im going to release this single player game for halflife 2 its a three part series and ends abruptly but i hope to add on a couple more parts to it in the future if i can find help currently this version isnt complete but its fun to play the idea is that ill probably make another map pack that will pickup where this one ends starting out in a room with a locked door just dont open it right away looking outside the window is sense of desperation in your situation dont jump out of the window because the door will be kicked open occasionally youll see a hev suit near the start of the levels those were put in while the levels were being built and i havent got around to removing them yet the end of the three levels is quite abrupt at the end of a large ditch thats just where ive stopped mapping im always looking for additional help with this project

8256211 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8256212 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong

8256438 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8256439 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing

8256444 one of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating noticing that jesus had given them a good answer he asked him of all the commandments which is the most important
8256445 the most important one answered jesus is this hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one
8256446 when jesus saw that he had answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god and from then on no one dared ask him any more questions
8256447 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8256448 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8256449 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8256450 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8256451 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8256452 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8256453 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8256454 i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8256455 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the world cup
8256456 ive actually extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8256457 im mentally strong enough to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8256458 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8256459 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8256460 im looking forward to seeing andrew providing real competition for gavin henson and sonny parker
8256461 although still a youngster andrew has already proven his worth to the ospreys and last season we really saw him starting to make an impact
8256462 isv virtual appliances should underpin a new surge in cloud use followed by self service mechanisms and enterprise connectors enabling organizations to cloudburst to using cloud services
8256463 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8256464 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8256465 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8256466 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8256467 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2
8256468 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers
8256469 we need a full review to determine whether the provincial government did all it could to prevent the listeriosis outbreak and whether it is properly equipped to address similar outbreaks in the future the governments reaction to date has been too little too late
8256470 in this case two months is a lifetime for a government that claims all went as it should the response was incredibly slow especially when you consider that lives are at stake doctors are telling us that if they had known of the risk earlier they would have been able to alert and closely monitor vulnerable patients

8256491 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park
8256492 newcastle can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8256493 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8256494 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8256495 i feel really good at villarreal and it is for this reason that we quickly reached an agreement
8256496 he is a super important player for us we have finished out recruitment and we cant make changes three days before the start of the championship

8256532 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8256533 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8256534 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8256535 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8256536 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8256537 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater

8256592 this fortified tower was built by sir john delves in 1364 on the site of a former moated manor house the tower was initially free standing and was probably intended as a place of refuge for the family in the 17th century it was incorporated into a range of domestic buildings which were known as doddington hall 3 in the civil war the hall became a garrison for the parliamentary forces it was taken for the king by lord byron in january 1644 but retaken shortly after in 1727 the house and estate passed to the broughton family the house was demolished around 1777 and replaced by the new doddington hall leaving the tower as a landscape feature which was possibly used as a gazebo or a banqueting pavilion the external staircase to the former house was retained when the house was demolished and it was attached to the tower

8256604 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines

8256609 an america defined by deep and meaningful equality from civil rights to labor rights from womens rights to gay rights
8256610 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding
8256611 meet the global challenges of our time democrats know how to do this
8256612 as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8256613 were not big on quitting but remember before we can keep going weve got to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states

8256615 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8256616 jefferson got it right at the dawn of the 19th century and its our challenge to get it right at the dawn of the 21st
8256617 this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8256618 but im going to be out there rooting for obama
8256619 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8256620 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver
8256621 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8256622 senator clinton congratulated her on her speech and michelle wished her good luck tonight
8256623 we know how were going to leave here but its still important that women have made this progress if were disenfranchised from casting a vote for hillary clinton it will be very difficult to feel a part of a unified process

8256629 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

8256719 he has the capacity to interact with all levels of teaching from little kids at to arrests he had made
8256720 there is no least he has made working very enjoyable
8256721 more by the spirit of the law than the letter of the law
8256722 hes a professional university policeman because hes friendly and respects every student faculty and staff member hes a genuinely friendly person were going to definitely miss him as he retires and goes fishing
8256723 athletic director brian quinn and president milton gordon really stepped up to keep me here and i couldnt be happier
8256724 if the school wins the ncaa tournament well build a statue and rename the gym
8256725 folks that i know in the profession told me this guy is a jewel and is definitely worth taking a look at
8256726 the turn around that hes been able make there is seriously nothing you can say about it
8256727 i wasnt really interested in either school but i wanted to hear what they had to offer
8256728 his interest is here and hes an old fashioned guy that is loyal
8256729 and he could have had more money if he went elsewhere but we had to keep him here
8256730 your reading about the pareto principle the rule of the vital few
8256731 uh yeah i guess i am its for a paper im working on
8256732 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8256733 most of the interest comes during the fall when people turn on their televisions thursday friday saturday and they see nothing but college football they look in the mirror and say we have 37 000 students on our campus why cant we have football too
8256734 a lot has changed since 1992 if you think back to 16 years ago we had two professional football teams in the los angeles orange county area the rams are in st louis and the raiders went back up to oakland long beach state at the time also had a program
8256735 this working group through the athletics advisory committee is going to be looking at the program looking at our infrastructure on campus looking to see how much is going to cost the university and students to actually see if it is feasible to have a football program back on our campus
8256736 personally i think the first step is a feasibility study we need to be able to have an outside consulting firm come in and find out what exactly needs to be done
8256737 a feasibility study tells you what will happen if you bring back football it doesnt tell you how to bring football back it would kind of give you an idea whether or not this community would wrap itself around a football program in terms of answering all the questions of scheduling and the gender equity issues i dont think a feasibility study will answer all those questions
8256738 i guarantee the university will take into account the results of a feasibility study
8256739 there are the ramifications within the department about the gender equity issues if we put 85 to 100 more participants on the male side we would have to put a similar or larger amount on the women side if we were to add two or three more women sports certainly it would be expensive and secondly where would we put them space is at a premium on this side of campus
8256740 every student who is a student at cal state fullerton can vote on it just like the regular voting booths when you go to vote for asi candidates it could be the next as elections during the fall or spring the fee increase could be another 50 a semester but the working group is also going to be looking into that
8256741 you have issues of who are you going to play our conference does not sponsor football therefore what conference do you belong to put together an 11 game football season
8256742 csuf is a state school and the entrance requirements are easier its easier to get the fringe athletes there is enough talent in the southern california area to support all three programs if you have the right facilities and staff
8256743 i constantly try to get my friends to come out to shows but they dont always have the energy or time to truck out to l a every night to see shows like i do
8256744 i wanted to introduce people to new music and at the same time get these great musicians playing in front of a big crowd
8256745 when we first started it was like i had never been skiing before and i went down a double black diamond run to begin with
8256746 it was a free for all and it went well
8256747 but the time was crunched it was a little too much
8256748 its not so much like a concert or a festival its more like a hang like were all at the same wedding or something
8256749 theres a lot of people on the boat that have seen me play but theres a lot of people that havent so its great
8256750 its a concentrated effort where i get to play for 15 20 minutes and give people a taste and get them excited about my cd so its like a first concentrated audiences to promote to
8256751 ive been on a couple cruises but never a boat like this with such a great vibe
8256752 this whole thing is an evolutionary expression of community based heart
8256753 erin hetrick has a huge heart and it really brings the community together
8256754 theyve invited me down there chile so i will be a little bit more experienced and a little bit more ready to go
8256755 im looking forward to maybe fighting to get a spot on the team but i will just be happy to be there and supporting everybody
8256756 girl look at how pale you are you need to get in the sun your skin just looks terrible

8256758 the responsible party is not in the area and we dont have any knowledge as to who it could have been because there was no package
8256759 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other

8256771 franks athleticism competitiveness and character is what first caught the eyes of our scouts his physical abilities are obvious but i think the intangibles he possesses will give him the opportunity to play in the nba one day
8256772 he didnt get to play as much as he had hoped during our summer league in salt lake city but was a wonderful teammate and did a great job when he did get the opportunity to play
8256773 coach burton was hard on me the whole time i was at fullerton
8256774 now that im gone and in this position i understand why he did what he did
8256775 he knew he wasnt going to play until he could guard someone and he really stepped it up on the defensive end
8256776 as he played with us throughout the summer he showed an unquenchable thirst to be coached and was eager to learn
8256777 i dont know if theres a player in my 39 years of coaching that i am going to miss more than frank

8256794 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8256795 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8256796 a more realistic assessment would be to consider the two factors of birth rates and immigration rates together when predicting population

8256812 the yesha council firmly objects to such draconian orders if a person or a group of people is suspected of planning to break the law it is the law enforcement authorities right and duty to deal with the matter

8256815 he opposed while in the illinois senate the born alive infant protection act which really is about infanticide
8256816 he did not want to protect babies who survived an abortion he did not want to provide basic medical care he wanted to kill them outside the womb allow them to die

8256825 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8256826 were announcing the launch of ubiquity a mozilla labs experiment into connecting the web with language in an attempt to find new user interfaces that could make it possible for everyone to do common web tasks more quickly and easily
8256827 the problem with the way the web stands now is that i have to go to services to use them

8256830 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states

8256832 you have a man running for president on the democratic ticket who believes in selective infanticide joined by a pro abortion catholic with delegates at the convention which are wildly out of step with what americans feel about this serious subject and you have the speaker of the house who doesnt even know what her religion teaches about the subject
8256833 if he obama were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8256834 i would say as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8256835 and saint augustine said at three months we dont know the point is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose
8256836 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8256837 to misrepresent what the catholic church teaches on the subject and which the catechism has said that from the first century the catholic church has been opposed to abortion that its never changed its teaching on the subject and when she said ive been studying this for a long time one has to wonder about her cognitive abilities
8256838 there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8256839 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8256840 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it

8256848 the benefits of biofuels cannot be achieved at the expense of food shortages and environmental degradation

8256895 es herrscht gewaltige sorge um den banksektor und die akteure rangeln um kapital
8256896 die meisten finanzinstitute sehen sich das kreditrisiko mittlerweile sehr genau an
8256897 wir sehen immer schw chere immobilienunternehmen und wir glauben dass sich der trend fortsetzt
8256898 der bankrott eines immobilienunternehmens kann eine sehr gef hrliche reihe von insolvenzf llen nach sich ziehen die die grundfeste des baugewerbes erheblich ersch ttern
8256899 vor acht wochen gab es keine zahlungsausf lle im anleihenmarkt

8256901 well see as much as the subprime losses again on the other side at the very least
8256902 the first stage is done were at the second stage the real issue is how much is how much the prime mortgage portfolio is going to be affected that is going to depend on how far house prices will fall
8256903 this is something we dont have a really good handle on i dont think anyone really knows
8256904 the imf figures seem most credible but if you believe others it could be a lot worse
8256905 thus it is still possible to envision a scenario under which the financial system avoids a sharp contraction in the supply of credit although this is significantly less likely now that it was as recently as may
8256906 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they will take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers preserve price stability while supporting growth and continue injecting liquidity as needed by an industry that is still far from having resolved its problems at a time of strong inflationary pressures and tightening credit conditions

8256913 helping others less fortunate than us and seeing thanks and appreciation is one of the best ways to feel good about yourself when you give to make the world better you earn the right to feel happy if you have two or more children have each pick a favorite charity to help out could be zoo visiting hospital soup kitchen etc dont think of it as trying to make them appreciate what they have although that wouldnt be a bad side effect think of it as tapping into their and your humanity and feeling the genuine and deserved appreciation of those with less

8256917 if there were a change in the currency the impact on the stock market would be as follows after an initial bounce we think a revaluation would have a negative impact as it makes investment in foreign markets relatively cheaper
8256918 listed companies that import would benefit from a revaluation those that have foreign earnings may lose out as rising inflation is eroding consumers disposable incomes and generating uncertainty for local companies it is likely that the tadawul all share index tasi would jump in the event of a revaluation
8256919 after this immediate euphoria has evaporated there is likely to be an outflow of funds this is because reducing the number of riyals necessary to buy a unit of foreign currency makes investment in foreign currency denominated assets more attractive

8256921 performance of all companies with foreign earnings will worsen in the event of a revaluation as these earnings will be worth less when converted into riyals and recorded in their financial statements
8256922 a revaluation would lower the value of commercial bank foreign assets and raise the value of foreign liabilities in addition to lowering the value of returns on foreign investment when reported in riyals insurance firms would see a similar impact on their balance sheets as would investment companies with large foreign holdings

8256941 he called and we talked for a bit he started talking about myspace and i told him that i had a confession and told him that i had broke into his e mails and had gotten her information i was expecting the usual ranting and raving and name calling but he didnt he said he was sorry and then from that point on told me everything about her and how she was his high school sweetheart and they had just recently met up again thanks to myspace
8256942 all that glitters isnt gold the grass is always greener why have such quotes stood the test of time and what do they mean obviously that many things look appealing at first but then turn out not to be
8256943 the only difference is at a bar you actually see and talk to a person in the flesh when you go on the internet you are getting a connection with a person in the machine and its really a fantasy to have an affair on a machine it is not real
8256944 why the attraction to high school honeys perhaps the single greatest reason is a tendency to idealize past relationships and fantasize about them rather than confronting problems in a current relationship
8256945 myspace facebook and other social networking sites are great for reconnecting with old friends and loves this is one more instance demonstrating the power of connection connecting with total strangers through social sites doesnt often pan out because the face to face meeting often has no chemistry but connecting with someone who shares your history can be very powerful
8256946 feeling tempted and fantasizing can cause you to act in such a way that your partner feels suspicious and threatened the most basic and common sign of temptation is a romantic charge that you feel and cannot deny and whenever you connect with this special someone somehow your day or evening brightens at this point you could diffuse the attraction by taking one simple action discuss it with your spouse if you felt the ease or freedom to discuss it you might discover what is driving the attraction it may be a quality that your spouse once had that now lies fallow or one that you and your spouse could foster if only you knew what it was

8257008 s 33 is silent with respect to canadian gathered evidence gives rise to the inference that parliament intended to permit such evidence to be admitted at an extradition hearing if it would otherwise be inadmissible under canadian law
8257009 is specifically addressed in s 32 2 of the act which makes it clear that canadian gathered evidence must comply with the canadian rules of evidence to be admitted at an extradition hearing
8257010 canadian gathered evidence except that forming part of a record of the case must comply with canadian rules of evidence nor in my view can that be reasonably inferred from these provisions when read together

8257016 the picture continues to look bright for scottish football with many clubs now displaying shrewd business acumen
8257017 the clubs demonstrated improved use of assets such as stadiums for corporate and hospitality events and strong strategies to tackle debt
8257018 while it is too early to predict the real impact of the credit crunch on scottish football this sounder financial footing with reduced debt and more affordable wage structures should help the majority of clubs to weather any financial storms as a result of a down turn
8257019 potentially one of the biggest impacts in 2008 09 will not be a decline in ordinary supporters buying tickets many are expected to continue juggling finances to ensure they dont miss any matches but in the corporate sector where sponsorship and support is discretionary and may be cut back if budgets have to be prioritised or shareholders pile on pressure
8257020 this years mantra is really steady as she goes with clubs finally consolidating their position ensuring they are strong enough to enough to weather the economic turbulence felt in the uk and further afield and developing strategies for growth in what is a tough marketplace

8257024 its an all too familiar tale she was in a relationship with this man and he was sent to prison
8257025 her partner had never been in custody before and he was finding himself vulnerable and a target for bullying
8257026 it was made known to him that harm would come to her and the child initially she would have nothing to do with it she refused and refused
8257027 there is no doubt that in normal cases a custodial sentence is appropriate for cases of taking drugs into prison
8257028 by any stretch of the imagination this was a minimal amount you took in if the prison value was 20 on the street it would be 10 or less
8257029 we will see what legislation the snp comes forward with
8257030 i want a stronger scotland a stronger scottish parliament within the uk
8257031 quite how that will then be judged will be up to the people of scotland but i do think its important to concentrate on issues that are important to them and not to politicians who love guffing on about the constitution
8257032 im not sure how you could have a multi option referendum in that sense
8257033 i think theres a real danger of independence getting in through the back door in that kind of construction of a referendum
8257034 and i will not do anything that allows that to happen
8257035 i think we need to not get obsessed by this i think politicians and the media are too obsessed by endless talk about referendums and the constitution
8257036 when calman produces its report when our own internal work is concluded on a blueprint for a stronger scotland and a stronger scottish parliament within the united kingdom then we will look at all these options but not until then

8257053 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8257057 in some moods or for some people the desire to improve can seem so natural as to be banal
8257058 the impulse drives forward so much in our culture that it can color our thoughts and shape our actions without being much noticed but in other moods or for other people this strenuous desire becomes all too noticeable and its demands crushing it can then drive a sleepless attention to ourselves a desolate evaluation of what we have been and what we are
8257059 but as they continue to explore the bafflements and enticements of a life that moves between two countries two cultures and two or more languages one senses that this emerging generation of foreign born jewish novelists short story writers and poets may contribute some new and especially interesting dimensions to american literature in the years ahead

8257069 i have written to our mps because we fear that this could be the start of trying to get rid of this boat

8257177 the quest for growth must always be balanced by a profound concern for social justice and equity
8257178 foremost is the preservation of social order without which there will be chaos freedom under the circumstances will be illusory in a truly democratic regime order is to be achieved through the exercise of authority with accountability not merely by the coercive power of the state
8257179 underpinning a humane economy is a philosophy of development guided by ethical and social concerns and founded upon the principles of justice and virtue
8257180 in a humane economy there is optimum utilization of scarce resources discipline in fiscal management promotion of a clear social agenda
8257181 orthopaedic intervention for stroke patients can help to maximize the chances that the affected arm for example may still be useful for activities of daily life
8257182 it is critical for the orthopaedic surgeon to become involved in the management of these patients immediately following the stroke to ensure the best possible outcome
8257183 during this time patients and families are primarily focused on the cognitive effects of the injury
8257184 but it is important to remember that there are numerous non surgical treatments that should be employed to maximize the functional use of the affected limb
8257185 it becomes crucial to consider surgery to reduce or eliminate painful muscle spasms and correct deformities the type of surgery performed depends on which areas are affected and whether or not the limb has been determined to be functional
8257186 as most people know usually by personal experience modern u s health care is hugely expensive and does not always assure safety
8257187 what were doing is exploring virtual worlds and ubiquitous computing that is the not so utopian and imminent world in which everything including objects is alive by virtue of being connected to a network as a model for efficient operations the ultimate goal is to move beyond modeling so that these systems may actually be used as tools in real hospitals real pharmacies and clinics and other care facilities
8257188 in the everything is alive vision objects talk to each other
8257189 our virtual objects do this and increasingly so can wirelessly connected real world objects so its time to generate a rich collection of vignettes or workflows that exercise this capability to understand it better for example well work on a situation in which a blood pressure machine interacts intelligently with an iv drip so that the latter can adjust appropriately based on information received from the former all of this can happen without fallible humans manually controlling both machines
8257190 some argue that my students and i are just having fun that we could model all of these things in older technologies such as queuing theory
8257191 my response is yes we are having fun and were beginning to see how virtual worlds excel in providing users with understandable simulations of business practices if the real world is moving toward identity management technologies like rfid to keep track of things we can get there first in a virtual world analyze business situations and then optimize to make them safer and less expensive

8257227 the primary literary sources pertaining to the period are contained in the biblical canon while undoubtedly based on ancient and oral tradition some of it reaching back into the mosaic period or even as far as the patriarchal age the biblical accounts are preserved in relatively late reworkings and are therefore not contemporary in a strict sense of the word with the events they describe editorial revisions were especially thorough when the subject matter pertained to the non monotheistic phases of early hebrew religion references felt to be offensive were toned down or abridged and we have of course no way of knowing how many were excised altogether in the narratives which deal with the subsequent period of the hebrew monarchy the monotheistic point of view is even more stringent so that all references to non monotheistic forms of popular worship are not only consistently derisive and unrelentingly condemnatory but are kept purposely in vague and general terms
8257228 the archaeological data while obviously suffering neither from subsequent modification nor from contemporary tendentious representation are disappointing because of their paucity or lack of clarity the temples sanctuaries high places altars and other religious structures which were unearthed from the early hebrew period contain as a rule no clear cut evidence as to the identity of the deity to whom they are dedicated
8257229 in a more general sense too there can be no doubt that down to the very end of the hebrew monarchy the worship of old canaanite gods was an integral part of the religion of the hebrews
8257230 it would appear then that only the baal was considered by elijah and the strictest yahwists in general as a dangerous rival of yahweh while the goddess asherah was regarded as his inevitable necessary or at any rate tolerable female counterpart
8257231 thus is appears that of the 370 years during which the solomonic temple stood in jerusalem for no less than 236 years or almost two thirds of the time the statue of asherah was present in the temple and her worship was a part of the legitimate religion approved and led by the king the court and the priesthood and opposed by only a few prophetic voices crying out against it at relatively long intervals
8257232 in the eyes of the yahwists to whom belonged a few of the kings and all of the prophets the worship of asherah was an abomination it had to be because it was a cult accepted by the hebrews from the canaanite neighbors and any and all manifestations of canaanite religion were for them anathema
8257233 it is clear that nothing can be added to the present limits and even dreaming of it has to be forgotten
8257234 there is no reason to presume that the economic forecast should differ in tone from the recent economic forecast

8257246 brother lawrence was one of the guys who pioneered that thought about doing every single little thing for the lord and staying connected with him throughout the day in prayer
8257247 rather than study the bible at some appointed hour i try to make worship much more just a natural flow and part of my day
8257248 a big challenge for me is to pray without ceasing as the bible tells us so i pray when i am out running or doing dishes when my mind is wandering i try and hone it back into praying im not very good at it yet
8257249 i want you to know that this family prays and prays for many things that it will be a good race that it will be a safe race but they never they never

8257397 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways

8257401 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8257402 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us

8257421 one of the things that ive been banging on about here and there recently is the way in which the costs of recycling systems are misstated for no one ever adds in the costs of the time taken by households to sort the materials so that they can be recycled my own crude numbers tell me that the costs of this labour are greater than the costs of the rest of the entire system put together no i dont think those numbers are right but i am insistent that the basic concept is correct which is why ive been rather blindsided by those who say that time spent not working for money doesnt actually have a value eh of course such time has a value theres an opportunity cost to your being forced to labour instead of doing something else

8257462 investigator francis g monaco met with several witnesses over the past months in regards to two incidents involving sheriff dean kelly and deputies from putnam county florida the date of each incident has been established to have occurred between december 2006 and january 2007
8257463 these incidents both involve large gatherings of young adults and juveniles
8257464 the brief description of the two incidents is as follows
8257465 the first incident involved a birthday party taking place at an area known as long pond in rural putnam county
8257466 the second incident reported was another party held and again sheriff kelly and deputies arrived and ordered the crowd to disperse at which time coolers and lawn chairs were thrown into the bonfire by sheriff kelly
8257467 at this incident a subject was told to leave the area and went to his friends residence on private property at which time sheriff kelly ordered him to leave the property
8257468 investigator francis monaco at each meeting with the persons interviewed has been told that there are many other witnesses but they are alleged too afraid to come forward allegedly fearing retaliation
8257469 the palatka daily news ran a story several weeks ago about the keg shooting incident at which time some anonymous calls were received by this investigator
8257470 only bits and pieces of information were gathered but addition names were provided

8257478 what i can tell you about is that wed like to try and make some signings between now and the transfer deadline
8257479 weve got a good number of targets in mind and those may or may not materialise that wouldnt be any different to any premier league football club
8257480 we wouldnt mind trying to add to the squad if at all possible
8257481 it didnt materialise at that time so i just go back and say to you that we would like to try and add to the squad if at all possible were making every effort to do so and we wouldnt be the only club
8257482 it is a pointless exercise to talk about players either coming into the club or potentially going out we dont really want to lose anybody if its at all possible

8257489 my game two weeks ago was poor in america and i took a couple of weeks off the second week ive been practising up here at gleneagles every day i feel very confident now in trying to win this event
8257490 this course has five par fives and they are our scoring holes with four of them reachable in two shots for the longer hitters i feel im going to have to be slightly more aggressive to win here than is normal
8257491 im looking for another 20 yards off the tee i think ive got 15 yards of it so im still five short

8257494 the players involved polish football and the national team have all lost because of this
8257495 i dont want to share the details of the events of that night because i dont want to destroy a players career and it would do that
8257496 there are different versions and a lot of speculation and i do have to defend my players
8257497 however boundaries were made clear right at the beginning and thats why i had to suspend three players
8257498 they are professionals and must behave like that they have to learn to take responsibility and learn from the mistakes they make everyone knows what the rules are
8257499 it was a very difficult decision to drop them one of the hardest ive ever taken
8257500 i spent the whole week thinking about it and struggled to get my head round it

8257531 it was a ridiculous decision its beyond me the way the fourth official reacted
8257532 there was no swearing or anything id been sitting on a towel and i threw it to the floor because i was so disgusted nothing else
8257533 the referee didnt speak to me he didnt ask to see me so i take it the matter is closed and nothing will happen because nothing should happen
8257534 if it does i will fight it because i did nothing wrong it was absolutely ridiculous
8257535 we had enough chances to win five games no question about that we played well created so many chances which is great but once again i must point the finger at the boys who did not capitalise
8257536 that has to be corrected whether through a change in personnel or by somehow getting the boys even sharper in those situations

8257545 its all right to feel anxious nervous even a little scared
8257546 but if youre feeling really overwhelmed talk to an adult dont feel that you cant talk to someone
8257547 now its disseminated in front of the whole world its one of the down sides of the internet parents need to be really on top of their kids and be aware of what their kids are doing online
8257548 theres the potential that future colleges or employers might pay to have this information and parents need to understand that the threat isnt just about giving information to predators
8257549 ive found that americans like peruvian foods so i wanted to open a place outside the downtown to help more people get acquainted with the food of my country
8257550 when this place went up for sale i grabbed it we did the whole place over
8257551 dont be a liar dont be a thief dont be lazy
8257552 i dont usually eat beef so i want to eat it today
8257553 i would say peruvian food is similar in some ways to japanese cuisine
8257554 the japanese serve sushi we serve ceviche which is fresh raw fish marinated in lime juice
8257555 i met him when i was dining in a peruvian restaurant in manhattan
8257556 i liked his cooking very much what i liked was that he cooks everything to order every thing is fresh
8257557 so when i decided to open a restaurant in danbury i asked him to be my chef he has been with me since we opened four years ago

8257560 the before you die element risks being a vulgarism implying that knowledge should be consumed voraciously however i took the view that putting these buildings together in a list would implicitly reveal their comparative strengths and weaknesses
8257561 it derives from the arabic classic the 1 001 nights and implies the endless potential of storytelling as well as the absurdity of limiting the knowable
8257562 its not the number of things you do in life
8257563 if you do one thing really well then that can make a life finding a cure for cancer for example is one thing but a very good thing that would be the advice of the greek philosophers
8257564 the risk of having 100 things to do can become a distraction and you only skate across the surface they become 100 distractions rather than 100 things lived for
8257565 its an implicit critique of consumerism that life is lived by consuming more rather than living well
8257566 we have not set anything yet and i kind of want to leave it that way for a little awhile
8257567 i can leave it open until the day before ive done that before if theyre that close i dont mind them feeling the pressure that they have to compete that long
8257568 it depends more on what they show me this week in practice
8257569 im not concerned about it because all of those guys have gotten better
8257570 im sure its a source of anxiety for these four guys who are competing but thats ok
8257571 whoever he chooses to put in its going to be the best for the team and thats the main goal to win
8257572 all of us are really good were just trying to represent this college i feel really good i just have to get the plays down
8257573 i think it means we have to be more leaders and know what were doing even more so
8257574 if coach doesnt feel confidence in our guard positions then he has to have confidence in us three now
8257575 theyre all trying to get ready to play whether all four will well find out
8257576 im good either way i really am im not trying to sit on the fence i see the positives of being down there i think going to denver is a good thing for denver and a good thing for the state having the kids play in invesco is a fun thing i think there are positives to playing on campus and having that home field advantage and that collegiate environment
8257577 the thing i think you try to avoid is to put too much in at this point
8257578 its for family and friends who have a loved one with a mental illness
8257579 if family members are educated it makes it easier for everyone
8257580 it makes it easier for family members to stay healthy and it helps the person who has the diagnosis of the mental illness be healthier as well

8257590 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands

8257600 we will not allow gherao type agitation to take place in west bengal
8257601 i am working now on a structure which i can be directly involved with for the development of other shooters and athletes i will actually try and groom people for the future i am in the process of starting off with a shooting plan
8257602 i will give more details on that when i have finalised the plan and things are a bit more concrete
8257603 i have not planned how to use it but i will certainly spend a portion of it on the development of olympic sports in the country
8257604 i want to use this time now when people are willing to listen to my opinion for the greater good of indian sport and actually go out there and make a difference
8257605 i would like to give back to not only shooting but also to the whole indian sport movement i would like to offer my help to all who seek it and also like to be available to other shooters so that i can share my experience with them
8257606 for the usual comment about how india underperforms it is very simple we dont have any sport structure whatsoever so the fact that we are even winning a couple of medals is phenomenal it is time we all join hands and try and change this acceptance of mediocrity
8257607 i think we should all be positive and actually offer solutions since it is pretty obvious we all know the problems
8257608 it is important that we do this in a team effort where the more the merrier and only when we all join hands can there be a change for the better in the indian system
8257609 performing at the top level always isnt really fun there is so much pressure to perform expectations to live up to facing your fears and doubts and yet one had to find a way out
8257610 it is certainly the pinnacle of my sporting career but i wont call it a turning point the turning point was the whole journey when i put in my everything to achieve my goal
8257611 olympic is a different experience altogether there is a greater aura around it as it is the greatest spectacle on the earth but the world championships is a tougher competition worlds best shooters participate there it is hard to answer
8257612 it is in 2010 which is still a long way

8257614 this time of year i start getting butterflies about all the things that can happen in a game
8257615 not just as a defense but as a whole team we got started late last season and we just want to start it off right this year
8257616 we didnt play as well in the kicking game and taking care of the football and tackling a very fine back and ucla certainly has a very fine back
8257617 its an all too familiar tale she was in a relationship with this man and he was sent to prison
8257618 her partner had never been in custody before and he was finding himself vulnerable and a target for bullying
8257619 it was made known to him that harm would come to her and the child initially she would have nothing to do with it she refused and refused
8257620 there is no doubt that in normal cases a custodial sentence is appropriate for cases of taking drugs into prison
8257621 by any stretch of the imagination this was a minimal amount you took in if the prison value was 20 on the street it would be 10 or less
8257622 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8257623 think about it youve got almost 200 delegates all really key figures within the democratic party all in one spot
8257624 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 he stiffed the city
8257625 i put like all the change i had into the meter
8257626 cornelius decided to take a stand against what he perceived to be bullying treatment carried out against him
8257627 in his words he wanted those who were doing this know he was not prepared to be a victim
8257628 we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep we have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts we have offended against thy holy laws we have left undone those things which we ought to have done and we have done those things which we ought not to have done but thou o lord have mercy upon us spare thou those who are penitent according to thy promises declared unto mankind in christ jesus our lord and grant o most merciful father for his sake that we may hereafter live a godly righteous and sober life to the glory of thy holy name
8257629 i have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud and your sins like a heavy mist return to me for i have redeemed you
8257630 for my part my son i no longer find pleasure in anything that this life holds what i am doing here still or why i am still here i do not know for worldly hope has withered away for me one thing only there was for which i desired to linger in this life to see you a catholic christian before i died and my god has granted this to me more lavishly than i could have hoped letting me see even you spurning earthly happiness to be his servant what am i still doing here
8257631 lay this body anywhere and take no trouble over it one thing only do i ask of you that you remember me at the altar of the lord wherever you may be
8257632 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8257633 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8257634 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8257635 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8257636 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8257637 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8257638 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8257639 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8257640 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8257641 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8257642 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8257643 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8257644 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8257645 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8257646 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8257647 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8257648 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8257649 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8257650 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8257651 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8257652 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8257653 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8257654 americans are as loved as they were 20 years ago
8257655 no problem whatsoever especially if you are a german speaker then they welcome you with open arms
8257656 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8257657 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8257658 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8257659 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8257660 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8257661 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8257662 what would you do if you didnt have enough skin to cover your entire body
8257663 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it
8257664 people can call in and talk to their favorite celebrity
8257665 this is what were asking the whole cancer community to do
8257666 put aside your competitive issues and come together for the greater good
8257667 outward success does not guarantee inner health it is the focus of well being instead of doing well it is a fundamental premise that if a church is well healthy it will also do well be successful in its mission the quality of the community is the quintessential test of the health of a church
8257668 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8257669 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8257670 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8257671 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8257672 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8257673 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8257674 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8257675 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8257676 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8257677 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm

8257682 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8257683 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8257684 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8257685 i resigned because of unpleasant events happened in the club the other reason of my resignation is that and the club is a part of financial frauds i stop my work in the club
8257686 mais masimov the president of the club and mubariz masimov the honorable president of the club offered favorable conditions for my job in the club
8257687 my resignation was coordinated with the president and the honorable president of the club although they did not want to accept my resignation at first later they agreed with my decision nobody keeps a man who wants to leave khazar lankaran

8257691 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8257692 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8257693 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8257694 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8257695 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8257696 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8257697 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8257698 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8257699 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8257700 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8257701 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8257702 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8257703 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8257704 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8257705 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8257706 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8257707 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8257708 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8257709 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8257710 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system

8257714 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8257715 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8257716 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8257717 senti bill non puoi startene l per le strade vieni a cantare nella band
8257718 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us

8257720 if you want to make god laugh tell him your plans
8257721 ali sistani has called on iraqis to register their names as the electoral list is regarded as an important document by the united nations
8257722 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8257723 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8257724 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8257725 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8257726 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8257727 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8257728 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

8257755 house bill 2167 allows extremely large boats as wide as 9 1 2 feet to be towed on any state road at anytime including night time any day of the week without a permit as required by all other states from texas to virginia this bill would also allow a blood alcohol level of 08 double that allowed by commercial vehicles of smaller size i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at a risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury north carolina has 60 000 miles of narrow two lane roads that cannot accommodate the 9 1 2 foot width and maintains roughly 1 000 bridges 18 feet wide or less which would require a 9 1 2 foot boat to cross the center line in violation of n c g s 20 146 and into oncoming traffic further if two 9 1 2 foot boats were to meet on an 18 foot strip of road or bridge it would be physically impossible to escape a collision i am deeply concerned about 9 1 2 foot boats meeting a school bus the buses travel primarily on rural roads and often in the dark during early morning and early evening hours i encourage the general assembly to let boat haulers use the current law of permitting for the rest of this season and then have the legislature take up this issue in january when there is time to thoughtfully avoid the consequences of this bill therefore i veto the bill
8257756 if this bill becomes law allowing these over width boats to travel on our highways and roads at night someones husband someones wife someones child will be killed and the governor and i dont want to be a part of that

8257837 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
8257838 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
8257839 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will

8257841 with snap we have the ability to populate approximately 60 to 70 percent of the information we need to process a workers compensation application with the touch of a button
8257842 that kind of time savings from an agencys perspective has to be worth money
8257843 snap will provide all the same capabilities for small workers comp except that this will be non exception based underwriting
8257844 when an agent is looking to place say a 5 000 10 000 or 15 000 piece of business it will either hit our sweet spot or not and were not going to waste either the agents time or ours
8257845 we just take the information from the expiring policy populate a new template within snap and put it through our rating algorithm with the new loss and payroll information
8257846 we estimate that it will shorten that process by 150 man hours per week

8257868 orthopaedic intervention for stroke patients can help to maximize the chances that the affected arm for example may still be useful for activities of daily life
8257869 it is critical for the orthopaedic surgeon to become involved in the management of these patients immediately following the stroke to ensure the best possible outcome
8257870 during this time patients and families are primarily focused on the cognitive effects of the injury
8257871 but it is important to remember that there are numerous non surgical treatments that should be employed to maximize the functional use of the affected limb
8257872 it becomes crucial to consider surgery to reduce or eliminate painful muscle spasms and correct deformities the type of surgery performed depends on which areas are affected and whether or not the limb has been determined to be functional
8257873 they need to know what they are spending their money on
8257874 this is the start of a budget now they have some more accurate numbers to work with
8257875 it certainly can help to show how saving to make a purchase and not just spending impulsively can help in the long run
8257876 if you are considering buying something ask yourself do i need it or is it just a want do not buy it right at that moment
8257877 leave the store and think about it and see if you decide to come back and purchase the item at a later date
8257878 if you overspend with a debit card and get an overdraft you are not ready for a credit card
8257879 i have found that if a young person understands that the same amount of money they pay every month for a minimum payment on their credit card could potentially make them a millionaire by the time they reach 65 they might think twice about using that credit card
8257880 parents need to take the time to talk to their children
8257881 if they parents are spenders they should tell their children you do not want to live paycheck to paycheck like we do if they are savers let them know how that has worked for them
8257882 a bad credit score can mean not being able to buy a car or home it also can mean higher interest rates and future credit costing you more
8257883 i think the credit card issue is about scaring students some but still letting them know that when they are used properly credit cards can be a good financial tool

8257886 stigmatization pollution signaling and symbolism earnings restatements and the market for directors
8257887 we like to think that we choose directors based on a rational assessment of their skills and track record but this does not appear to be the case instead its like a witch hunt companies get nervous about associating with other tainted companies and their directors are essentially used as scapegoats
8257888 it is difficult to know for sure if they leave voluntarily or are asked to leave
8257889 in the third year after restatement outside directors are much more likely to lose seats on other boards if the restatement reduced income if it was the result of fraud and if they were in office at the time of the restatement
8257890 nobody believed this could be the case yet the evidence suggests that board appointments and renewals are not entirely based on rational calculation
8257891 shareholders should look at the companies they invest in really carefully if theyre interested in corporate governance and protecting their own investments they need to rely on more than media accounts and a companies own press both of which can produce biased information

8257897 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8257898 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

8257900 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8257901 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8257902 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8257903 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8257904 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8257905 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8257906 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8257907 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8257908 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

8257929 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8257930 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8257931 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8257932 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8257933 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8257934 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8257935 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8257936 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8257937 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8257938 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8257939 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8257940 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

8257956 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8257957 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8257958 those are the reasons i ran for president these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8257959 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8257960 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8257961 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8257962 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8257963 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8257964 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8257965 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8257966 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8257967 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8257968 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8257969 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8257970 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8257971 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8257972 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8257973 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8257974 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8257975 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8257976 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8257977 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8257978 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8257979 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8257980 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8257981 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8257982 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8257983 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8257984 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8257985 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8257986 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8257987 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8257988 this mess just wont end and if it doesnt end soon like today the democrats will lose in november again the mess i refer to hillary supporters continued up the ante demands for respect and validation for hurt feelings to be soothed voices to be heard etc
8257989 but there was one big flaw in the pitch clinton never made the case that barack obama was ready to lead as commander in chief that was her strongest argument against obama during the primary so strong the mccain campaign is recycling her ad about the president answering the phone at 3 a m maybe joe biden is planning to address that issue for obama and clinton needed to stay focused on convincing her supporters still it felt like a hole
8257990 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8257991 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8257992 can barack obama dominate barack obamas convention or will it be dominated by the clintons
8257993 he then visited her banks web site where her user name was simply her first initial and last name
8257994 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it
8257995 people can call in and talk to their favorite celebrity
8257996 this is what were asking the whole cancer community to do
8257997 put aside your competitive issues and come together for the greater good
8257998 the us condemned actions made by the russians to invade georgia and destroy civilian infrastructure
8257999 were excited that canadian audiences have responded with such enthusiasm to flashpoint s stories of humanity and adrenaline
8258000 were extremely proud to have this opportunity to bring more of our homegrown stories to viewers in canada and around the world
8258001 flashpoint has hit its mark with north american audiences and remained competitive even during the olympics
8258002 viewers have embraced flashpoint and we are answering their call for more the cast and creative team have delivered a series that not only entertains with high intensity drama but with heart as well
8258003 celui qui affronte un policier risque la mort fredy villanueva et son fr re devaient le savoir
8258004 un des policiers a point lun des jeunes et lui a dit de sapprocher ce que celui ci a refus de faire expliqua cruz
8258005 le policier sest avanc vers moi et ma dit je tai vu jouer aux d s
8258006 do nous tions nous voyions la tension augmenter entre les policiers et les jeunes on savait que quelque chose de grave allait arriver comme le policier frappait le jeune homme les deux autres jeunes un noir et un latino se sont approch s du policier et ont tent de larr ter
8258007 jai vu une arme feu pr s de mon visage une douille voler et mon fr re par terre
8258008 j tais en train de devenir fou je voyais mon fr re par terre en train de se vider de son sang et moi javais des menottes
8258009 il y a eu un mouvement de panique dans le parc
8258010 les gens se sont mis courir partout personne ne savait qui avait tir sur qui

8258014 je nai aucune id e du pourquoi de lintervention polici re les policiers ne mont rien dit
8258015 le policier a utilis son arme dans le seul but de prot ger un coll gue les agents auraient t encercl s par une dizaine de personnes dans le parc
8258016 cest comme dans les banlieues fran aises les gens dici connaissent leur quartier mieux que personne ils ont fil travers les cours et sont revenus par derri re
8258017 ce nest pas un conflit entre blancs et noirs affirma un meutier cest un conflit entre les jeunes de montr al nord et la police

8258019 on a jamais vu quelque chose comme a montr al ajouta le chef de police 12
8258020 si la justice nest pas faite on fera la justice avec nos mains
8258021 il aurait alors suffi dun seul projectile lanc gauche ou droite pour que tout bascule nouveau
8258022 il ny a pas de doute il va y avoir une reprise des violences a fait beaucoup trop longtemps que la police se prend pour dieu dans montr al nord d clara un jeune homme alors quil entrait au complexe fun raire o fredy villanueva tait expos 16 il va y avoir de la violence a ne sarr tera pas l autant les mauvais jeunes que les bons sont r volt s par la mort de fredy
8258023 si le maire ne nous coute pas montr al nord va br ler une deuxi me fois

8258029 certains dentre eux navaient aucun lien avec fredy villanueva ni avec le quartier de montr al nord
8258030 on essaie de confirmer cela avec des t moins mais il y a des gens parmi ceux sur les photos qui auraient aussi t vus lors des v nements du centre bell
8258031 jaurais fait la m me chose sa place on pense tous comme a ici
8258032 ce faisant la haute direction en plus de ne pas soutenir ses membres sur la place publique a donn limpression davoir plus de compassion pour la famille que de consid ration pour les policiers
8258033 ce n tait pas la place du service de police affirma yves francoeur en entrevue au journal de montr al
8258034 les policiers ne lacceptent pas du tout ils se sont sentis trahis
8258035 le directeur se comporte comme un agent sociocommunautaire sindigna francoeur
8258036 le r le dun directeur cest d tre un g n ral les appels au calme la politicaillerie quon laisse a aux politiciens
8258037 on est convaincus qu cause des pressions sociales des pressions politiques il va y avoir des accusations d pos es contre notre policier la seule chose quon peut lui reprocher cest davoir bien fait son travail
8258038 nos gens taient l mais il ny avait pas dordre qui sortait pour les faire intervenir
8258039 nos yeux sont braqu s sur la direction parce que le prochain v nement ils sont mieux de le g rer comme du monde on est tann s davoir lair fou
8258040 quand jen arrive l cest parce que jen ai plein mon casque pr cisa t il le moral des troupes par rapport la direction est catastrophique
8258041 l meute de dimanche na pas r solu les probl mes de montr al nord
8258042 les politiciens navaient rien dire au sujet de la fusillade jusqu ce qu clatent l meute le jour suivant
8258043 leur t l phone cessera de sonner assez vite nous allons tous nous lasser de parler de montr al nord apr s les fun railles de villanueva aujourdhui moins quil ny ait dautres brasiers montrer en une et au bulletin de nouvelles nous avons un coup de coeur pour les flammes

8258046 le grand paradoxe finalement est que les policiers sont souvent les seuls repr sentants de l tat ou disons des autorit s publiques tre pr sents dans des zones comme celle l
8258047 vous voulez d noncer le harc lement policier formez une association composez une toune rap filmez ce qui se passe dans votre quartier et montrez vos images aux m dias bref faites quelque chose de constructif au lieu de tout d truire

8258053 cest triste mais souvent a prend des cas comme celui de cette semaine pour faire avancer le d bat
8258054 nous avons eu le m me d bat que vous il y a 20 ans apr s que plusieurs noirs eurent t tu s par des policiers en ontario et nous en sommes venus la conclusion que les policiers navaient pas les comp tences pour enqu ter sur dautres policiers
8258055 les enqu tes men es par la police dans des circonstances semblables ne sont pas aussi rigoureuses et ont tendance d montrer du favoritisme en fait lenqu te veut souvent justifier le travail policier plut t que d tablir les faits malheureusement votre syst me souffre du m me probl me

8258058 je nai rien contre la sq expliqua le d put c t

8258060 ces gens l policiers sont trait s de la m me fa on que les citoyens ordinaires
8258061 soixante pour cent des homicides sont lucid s en moins dune journ e en g n ral le principal suspect est interrog dans les heures suivant le meurtre les r gles sont diff rentes quand lauteur de lhomicide volontaire ou non est un policier

8258063 dans les directives on dit quil faut interroger les t moins le plus t t possible indiqua normandeau
8258064 lexplication des policiers est de dire quils sont traumatis s et quon doit attendre un certain temps avant de les interroger affirma le criminologue mais on pourrait dire que les autres t moins civils sont aussi traumatis s
8258065 les enqu teurs trouvent toujours de bonnes raisons pour expliquer le retard dun interrogatoire de t moin policier souligna louise viau professeur de droit luniversit de montr al bien entendu ces nombreux d lais offrent aux policiers loccasion de peaufiner leur version des faits
8258066 on ne peut pas avoir confiance en cette enqu te

8258091 our goal is to try to improve the forecast of severe weather as opposed to the daily forecast of weather that might disrupt a softball game but its not really going to tear your house down
8258092 you are watching the hurricane move towards the coast and you think oh its making landfall down by savannah georgia and i live in myrtle beach so im clear and then bam you get hit by a tornado
8258093 they happen a lot and people are caught unaware across the carolinas in 2004 and 2005 alone there were over 130 tornadoes in association with just seven tropical cyclones none of which actually made landfall on the north carolina coast it was just the remnants moving through its a fairly important forecast issue for our area
8258094 the traditional conceptual model is that the individual storms that comprise the hurricane rain bands are ordinary over the ocean and the increase in surface friction over land creates the miniature supercells
8258095 what we have been finding is that you can actually have these miniature supercells form out over the ocean and then produce tornados on or very near the beach
8258096 we are trying to provide proof of concept through high density observations
8258097 ultimately if we can understand what causes the supercell out over the open ocean then we can help forecasters to detect them earlier with radar and give everyone a little more forewarning
8258098 we are creating a neighborhood gym that is as comfortable and effective as any other

8258101 physicians share insights or barriers to delivering ideal care and providers are tasked with developing the appropriate educational curriculums to help address these challenges
8258102 that is why at pri med we listen to the needs of health care professionals to deliver education whenever however and on what topics to make for the best learning experience
8258103 in the absence of a traditional academic infrastructure in the us to provide readily accessible and innovative education to meet the clinical care gaps of the hundreds of thousands of physicians in active practice physicians rely on cme opportunities from professionally managed accredited organizations like pri med to fill the void and drive innovation in this area
8258104 we need all the help we can get for any hope of staying current
8258105 at pri med we acknowledge the industry debate surrounding cme
8258106 interestingly as the diverse discussions regarding the emerging direction have intensified the consumption and demand of cme remains and has actually increased among healthcare practitioners reflecting the fact that the value and importance of has never been greater therefore pri med remains committed to building and delivering the most clinically relevant innovative and fair balanced cme solutions to meet physician and ultimately patient needs

8258111 as most people know usually by personal experience modern u s health care is hugely expensive and does not always assure safety
8258112 what were doing is exploring virtual worlds and ubiquitous computing that is the not so utopian and imminent world in which everything including objects is alive by virtue of being connected to a network as a model for efficient operations the ultimate goal is to move beyond modeling so that these systems may actually be used as tools in real hospitals real pharmacies and clinics and other care facilities
8258113 in the everything is alive vision objects talk to each other
8258114 our virtual objects do this and increasingly so can wirelessly connected real world objects so its time to generate a rich collection of vignettes or workflows that exercise this capability to understand it better for example well work on a situation in which a blood pressure machine interacts intelligently with an iv drip so that the latter can adjust appropriately based on information received from the former all of this can happen without fallible humans manually controlling both machines
8258115 some argue that my students and i are just having fun that we could model all of these things in older technologies such as queuing theory
8258116 my response is yes we are having fun and were beginning to see how virtual worlds excel in providing users with understandable simulations of business practices if the real world is moving toward identity management technologies like rfid to keep track of things we can get there first in a virtual world analyze business situations and then optimize to make them safer and less expensive

8258133 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8258134 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8258135 a more realistic assessment would be to consider the two factors of birth rates and immigration rates together when predicting population

8258153 that you can do anything you want in life if you work really hard at it
8258154 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8258155 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area
8258156 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8258157 increases in the prevalence of these risk factors may have contributed to the upward trend in incidence
8258158 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8258159 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8258160 there is a feeling among doctors that you should not put somebody on a drug until you really really have to but this work suggests that giving drugs at an early stage has an effect over and above what you would expect

8258164 private property is highly regarded in this country and to enter a private premises to do that is something we have to look at very carefully
8258165 weve put it in as part of the process if there are too many difficulties constitutional difficulties it may not be part of the legislation
8258166 there are many other steps that we can take and that is a fairly draconian one
8258167 if theres an alarm going off and its been going off all weekend people will say please turn that off
8258168 the point is what are the legal implications can it be done easily are there severe constitutional difficulties
8258169 if it means a constitutional change it would be difficult to pursue if it doesnt then we can pursue it
8258170 in far too many cases when you have disturbance what people do is they contact the garda if gardai are not authorised officers there is little can be done

8258187 when you talk of steam people think you are going backwards
8258188 anywhere where you are wasting a lot of heat we can go in capture the heat and turn it into energy savings steam has tremendous power if it can drive a steam locomotive why cant it drive an automotive engine
8258189 there is a lot of heat that is created and totally wasted
8258190 recycling exhaust heat and energy that is rejected from the engine has got to be the way forward in the future
8258191 a tank of petrol or a tank of diesel is such an incredibly good energy store that we have been able to afford to throw some of it away up until now
8258192 any technology that can be gradually introduced like that is a very sensible idea so i think they are doing exactly the right thing
8258193 its a perfectly feasible idea certainly it adds complexity to the engine and therefore cost and i think thats why we havent seen it before
8258194 obviously now with rising oil prices etc it becomes essential to extract more energy from the fuel you are putting in

8258230 we havent talked for years but the game is sold out and i need some tickets
8258231 there are lots of tickets to be had even though my whole family wants to come to the game and most of my high school football team and kickoff is in 45 minutes
8258232 this is ridiculous i havent talked to these people for months marwan already coerced my tickets away from me and i didnt even know he knew my name
8258233 please marwan i know your car dealers family is in town and you like to fan yourself with unused game tickets but could i at least have two tickets for my grandparents
8258234 this is hopeless whats the point nobody cheers for me and my friends and family are all rider fans anyway
8258235 fine marwan go ahead and make that fan a couple tickets bigger it is hot out and you need to keep cool before the game
8258236 the closure comes following a further deterioration of the situation in the area where the clinic is located

8258247 a mid year review of the chap common humanitarian action plan for 2008 showed that we needed more funding than we had first thought
8258248 this is partly because of increased food costs which is the largest single cost component and the new humanitarian needs in the country particularly in the north
8258249 we are concerned that if the projects are not funded adequately the objectives set out in the chap would not be met
8258250 what is important is that with increasing needs here in sri lanka we get funds in the next months
8258251 because there have been a number of other humanitarian crises this year many potential donors to our chap have limited additional funds for sri lanka during the first part of the year the humanitarian needs in sri lanka may have seemed less pressing to some donors
8258252 ogni anno ha spiegato ermete realacci ministro dellambiente del governo ombra del pd che a fine giugno aveva presentato uninterrogazione parlamentare sul tema vengono segnalati un numero crescente di casi di morie di intere colonie di api e sarebbe un errore pensare a questo fenomeno come un problema che riguarda solo gli insetti e gli apicoltori le api infatti oltre a rappresentare un indicatore molto sensibile dellequilibrio ambientale contribuiscono per l80 allimpollinazione delle coltivazioni che costituiscono un terzo della nostra alimentazione per un valore stimato pari a 2 5 miliardi di euro allanno in italia e ben 10 miliardi di euro allanno nel mondo oltre che la maggior parte delle piante da frutto dipendono dallazione impollinatrice delle api anche la produzione delle colture foraggere fondamentali per i prati destinati agli animali da allevamento

8258254 la francia che rimane il primo paese europeo produttore di mais ha messo al bando da tempo i pesticidi ritenuti responsabili della moria delle api recentemente e senza troppi indugi la stessa germania il paese della bayer e la slovenia hanno deciso di sospendere luso delle molecole incriminate perch hanno riscontrato una spaventosa impennata dei decessi in conseguenza ai trattamenti con gli agrofarmaci e ora che si riveda radicalmente la procedura dautorizzazione dei prodotti fitosanitari ha rivendicato hubert ciacci presidente della s g a non ci si pu limitare alla constatazione degli effetti a breve periodo di mortalit acuta ma occorre studiare leffetto delle molecole sia singolarmente e sia in sinergia tra loro sulle api e sulla vita nel tempo e secondo tutte le variabili possibili e giunta lora che vengano considerate tutte le fonti di approvvigionamento delle api quali lacqua e il polline in primis quello del mais

8258564 it gets a little disheartening when you watch your team lose over and over again
8258565 for now it might just be a couple days of the week to start out with but eventually we hope to have entertainment out there whenever its sunny and nice especially during lunch hours when students are out there
8258566 we want to have a visible entertainment program for the students
8258567 its to inform entertain and educate the duke community but its also to achieve the goal of involving a lot of people who might not necessarily be involved already
8258568 we built a brand last year and theres an expectation there and its a matter of not just keeping up to those expectations but surpassing them
8258569 were thinking out of the box we want to be in a position where we cant even see the box

8258573 reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8258574 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8258575 the special reference to the palestinian issue implies that israel is practicing racism
8258576 it is only one paragraph that mentions the palestinians so the interest of israel was never badly damaged
8258577 inspired by the struggle of south africans against apartheid and in the spirit of international solidarity moral consistency and resistance to injustice and oppression
8258578 inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8258579 mirror efforts by islamic states at the un human rights council to insinuate islamic anti blasphemy prohibitions into international law yet un expert on religious freedom asma jahangir and other international human rights experts have expressly opposed defamation of religion resolutions which seek to alter international human rights law by defining religions instead of individuals as the bearers of rights
8258580 la grande marcia della distruzione intellettuale proseguir tutto sar negato tutto diventer un credo e una posizione ragionevole negare le pietre della strada diventer un dogma religioso riaffermarle e una tesi razionale quella che ci vuole tutti immersi in un sogno sar una forma assennata di misticismo asserire che siamo tutti svegli fuochi verranno attizzati per testimoniare che due pi due fa quattro spade saranno sguainate per dimostrare che le foglie sono verdi in estate noi ci ritroveremo a difendere non solo le incredibili virt e lincredibile sensatezza della vita umana ma qualcosa di ancora pi incredibile questo immenso impossibile universo che ci fissa in volto combatteremo per i prodigi visibili come se fossero invisibili guarderemo lerba e i cieli impossibili con uno strano coraggio noi saremo tra quanti hanno visto eppure hanno creduto
8258581 gareth made a decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8258582 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8258583 any talks regarding a potential new contract and aston villa will not be taking place until the end of the season

8258589 you may take one look at me and drop out of this course
8258590 his role is not to be just another not just to throw three more things out there
8258591 his role is to step away from the fray of interventions and step back and collectively look at we do
8258592 for the most part there are a lot of entities happening but no cohesive thread
8258593 thats where this office comes into play by putting together the pieces through health education with student involvement policies residential life and faculty running classes around alcohol and substances
8258594 if a student comes to me and says i want a job in investment banking its going to be tough and he or she might want to come up with alternative strategies and alternative types of career paths
8258595 i cant predict exactly what is going to happen but my best guess is that theres going to be a slow down i cant tell you how severe it is going to be thats why i dont read crystal balls
8258596 the trend is definitely toward more rather than fewer financial services in terms of careers
8258597 i really hope the fla delegation bkfast doesnt suck like yesterday sausage gravy tasted like it was made in an ashtray

8258603 in japan growth will be a little slower without something like germanys feed in tariff system
8258604 depending on the size of the subsidies the domestic market might just grow by a double digit percentage in three to four years
8258605 in a globalized society many more americans must learn to appreciate and navigate islamic cultures i trust many duke students will be included in the list
8258606 if youre a chemist you can stay at home and do it in gross chem but if youre eager to be credentialed with an islamic studies certificate you must travel to some part of the expanse of afro eurasia
8258607 i am fortunate enough to have so many opportunities that i dont want to pass those up
8258608 this incident itself is definitely a negative image i dont know how bad it really is sometimes it might be a good thing for people to hear this name to find some news about this
8258609 i hope i really hope this can be turned into something better than we thought
8258610 you get used to the chinese accent and not used to the real american accent especially the southern accent
8258611 when i first got here when i turned on the tv i didnt even want to watch it
8258612 i just didnt have the motivation to listen to more english you just give up
8258613 all the streets are very open and i look around theres no people only me
8258614 so i feel lonely i feel cold just nobody to talk with to play with especially in the evening
8258615 i dare not go out because of the robbery so you stay home
8258616 i didnt expect self segregation to be like this at duke
8258617 we dont drink that much but we talk a lot
8258618 we are chinese we are overseas were not in our mother land
8258619 when our traditional festivals come we have strong feelings and thinking home thinking mom
8258620 asian students typically give the stereotype that asian students study mathematics or study sciences and dont really talk much
8258621 but i think thats no longer the case asian students are active and eager to break the glass ceiling
8258622 in addition the living style in china is much closer to here now thus the culture shock is smaller and current students are richer than i was
8258623 if youve been exposed to so called western capitalists or materialistic stuff for a long time it wont be that bad
8258624 but if you come from little cities in china youre pretty much very shocked when you first get to america
8258625 as a chinese student i typically just go through the rankings on u s news
8258626 from what weve heard over the years is that chinese students seem to be very satisfied with their undergrad in their home country but in the research science fields they look to the u s
8258627 i think most people come here arent satisfied with the fact that theyre only graded on one test
8258628 before that you can talk to someone and itll be harvard and thats pretty much it
8258629 to look at the bars of signal on a phone is a very unreliable measurement method
8258630 there can be differences of 10 20 db by moving the phone half a meter or if a car drives by there is no standard on how the bars should be displayed
8258631 have no problems with the 3g communication in the test chamber they send and receive signals in a fully normal manner they do not disconnect earlier than the others we have tested when the signal becomes weaker
8258632 the sony ericsson with all the 3g bars makes it in 46 seconds for my iphone with edge it takes 32
8258633 i do not draw any conclusion from this there is so many factors influencing the outcome
8258634 we can at least be certain of one thing the three iphones we tested had nothing wrong with their antennas
8258635 at amp t has delivered hspa service at 850mhz wherever possible with more on the way this year as we redeploy additional 850 spectrum previously used for our tdma network

8258639 this course has five par fives and they are our scoring holes with four of them reachable in two shots for the longer hitters i feel im going to have to be slightly more aggressive to win here than is normal

8258646 quanto accaduto a san marco evangelista con laggressione allassessore alessandro grieco da parte di un gruppo di lavoratori del servizio di rimozione rifiuti costituisce un episodio inqualificabile e da condannare
8258647 tutto ci inammissibile specie se episodi di violenza come questi vengono perpretati allinterno di uffici pubblici ed in danno di amministratori al servizio della comunit da quanto risulta oltretutto la nuova amministrazione di centrosinistra anche in regola con il pagamento delle quote al consorzio per lo smaltimento dei rifiuti circostanza che aggrava se possibile la posizione degli autori dellaggressione allassessore grieco conclude la nota del pd provinciale va quindi la solidariet del partito che ribadisce la ferma condanna dellaccaduto ed auspica che simili deplorevoli episodi non abbiano pi a ripetersi
8258648 se afferma capodanno come denunciato da alcune associazioni dei consumatori dalle indagini promosse dallantitrust contro il caro libri espletate in questi giorni dalla guardia di finanza anche in campania emergeranno irregolarit allora a pagarne le conseguenze anche in relazione ad eventuali comportamenti omissivi dovranno essere in primis i dirigenti scolastici delle scuole dove si riscontrasse il superamento del tetto di spesa ed il direttore generale dellufficio scolastico regionale
8258649 particolare attenzione deve inoltre essere prestata da parte dei collegi dei docenti alle nuove edizioni le quali a norma dellallegato a annesso al citato decreto n
8258650 le istituzioni scolastiche devono comunicare entro e non oltre il 10 giugno 2008 sulla base di specifiche istruzioni che saranno tempestivamente comunicate allaie e allufficio scolastico regionale i dati delle adozioni effettuate
8258651 a questo punto conclude capodanno laddove si riscontrassero anomalie nella procedura seguita con conseguente superamento del tetto di spesa fissato per ciascun ordine di scuola e per le singole classi bisogner anche verificare se i dirigenti scolastici hanno posto in essere tutti le iniziative e quali tese a sensibilizzare i docenti e se il direttore dellufficio scolastico regionale ha effettuato le prescritte verifiche sul rispetto dei limiti di spesa con le eventuali conseguenti contestazioni

8258674 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30m or 40m players

8258677 hurricane gustav should pass near the southwestern peninsula of haiti tonight and move near or just south of eastern cuba on wednesday
8258678 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8258679 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides

8258681 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8258682 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8258683 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8258684 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8258685 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8258686 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8258687 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8258688 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8258689 when you go out you represent this house so behave for our names sake
8258690 and this is what we want to avoid this year
8258691 we have large chunks of the northern part of our country which could assure us food security in ghana if we also go about the planning of the agricultural development there properly

8258695 despite notable weaknesses in the implementation of the limited registration effort the overall credibility of the ghanaian electoral process has not been lost most polling officials and political party agents completed their duties with commendable professionalism
8258696 party agents in a number of registration centres acted as substitutes for the election officials in determining the eligibility of citizens to register
8258697 in some cases the eligibility of registrants was determined outside of the official procedure leading to concerns about foreign underage or multiple registration attempts in other stations the political parties provided food for the election officials these actions could compromise the appearance of impartiality on the part of the ec
8258698 the busing could have been legitimate in some cases however inadequate citizen education about the registration process coupled with the possibility that the busing was the product of political party attempts to rig the voters roll fuelled public suspicions that could undermine the credibility of the registration
8258699 these equipment shortages led to long delays and increased tension among citizens and political party representatives this tension in turn led to some election officials taking shortcuts to expedite the process
8258700 in several areas visited by observers it was clear that the lack of political tolerance produced an intimidating environment in some cases those situations devolved into violent confrontations between supporters of the two dominant political parties
8258701 the ec should ensure that political parties and citizens are informed of the mechanisms in place to resolve electoral disputes particularly in the event of a closely contested election
8258702 political parties and candidates should abide by the 2008 political parties code of conduct and respect the interventions of the code of conduct enforcement body
8258703 the ec should ensure that all ad hoc staff members are adequately trained in the task of administering elections and are aware of their appropriate relationship to political party agents in future registration efforts but also during voting operations

8258712 the heavy pace of foreclosures has also been a major force pushing home prices lower as lenders aggressively price their backlogs of repossessed real estate hoping to unload them before prices fall further

8258762 wendys has been offering 2 fat white and 1 fat chocolate milk but with the move to nesquik both choices will now contain only 1
8258763 were very excited that wendys has selected nestle nesquik as part of their nutritious childrens menu
8258764 this is the first time that weve created a fortified white milk product and were pleased to debut it at wendys alongside our ever popular chocolate flavored milk the nesquik name and the image of the bunny resonate well with kids kids will think theyre getting an extra treat while parents will know that their children are getting a nutritious beverage with their meal

8258775 eu o vi jogar na televis o antes de entrar em quadra vi alguns pontos de seu jogo ent o tudo o que posso dizer sobre ele
8258776 talvez tivesse sido melhor para mim enfrentar o capdeville contra quem joguei aqui na segunda rodada do ano passado ouvi dizer que eles fizeram um jogo longo e que estavam com c ibras no final mas ele ter dois dias de descanso e vai estar bem na seq ncia provavelmente vai ser algo similar a hoje contra gonz lez um jogador mais de fundo de quadra

8258809 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
8258810 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

8258814 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

8258825 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8258826 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8258827 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8258828 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8258829 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8258830 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8258831 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8258832 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8258833 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8258834 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8258835 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8258836 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8258837 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8258838 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8258839 who are open to doing something on the production side
8258840 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8258841 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8258842 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8258843 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8258844 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8258845 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8258846 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8258847 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8258848 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8258849 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8258850 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8258915 ive sort of created that image but its definitely a part of who i am one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in mini skirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels
8258916 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird but if i didnt have a sexy side i wouldnt have done playboy magazine and i wouldnt have done baywatch and a lot of other things

8258929 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8258930 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen

8258936 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8258937 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8258938 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8258939 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8258940 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8258941 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8258942 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8258943 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8258944 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8258945 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8258946 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8258947 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8258948 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8258949 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8258954 when kevin first arrived he was a monster as far as physical size
8258955 he was competition so i scoped him out real well i watched him improve every day through a strong work ethic and finally you look up and say whoa this guy has some serious skills
8258956 im at a loss for words kevin duckworth hes not supposed to be gone so young i loved that guy he was a great teammate one of the best i ever had we were extremely close
8258957 and we got along great for as big a guy as he was he had a very tender heart thats what everybody loved about him
8258958 wed argue hed call me a fool you know how brothers are but everything was done in a loving manner

8258973 ive seen people hit polls take out planters its that 6 oclock deadline everybodys riding those times and youve got all these people who think they have the right away and they dont its scary sometimes
8258974 its hard to actually pull out of my driveway in the morning
8258975 its a residential and people are speeding and to me its just not fair that this lane is causing trouble to us
8258976 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8258977 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8258978 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8258979 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8258980 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8258981 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8258982 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8258983 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8258984 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8258985 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8258986 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8258987 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8258988 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8258989 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8258990 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8259099 as the worlds population grows so will demand for food and energy using non food feedstocks for feed and energy is one way that agriculture can apply innovation to create renewable sustainable solutions
8259100 there are a number of challenges associated with harvest collection and storage of cellulosic biomass this collaborative effort brings together three agricultural leaders to identify and address the complexities that come with commercializing a new feedstock
8259101 expansions in biorenewable energy are possible if we are able to combine productivity and sustainability improvements in agriculture and forestry with a variety of biomass feedstocks and the most applicable conversion technologies
8259102 we are hopeful the collaboration of our companies will lead to innovative technologies to improve collection and provisioning of biomass feedstocks such as corn stover
8259103 advanced biotechnologies are protecting plants better than ever helping the plants to achieve their full grain yield potential
8259104 achieving this potential also means having healthier larger plants producing even more biomass this provides an opportunity to convert an underutilized resource into a new source of value for growers and processors its an exciting area of research to focus on and were pleased to be a part of it

8259123 we need non verbal cues to tell us what is important what is significant and what should we be looking for
8259124 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8259125 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8259126 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8259127 when she was talking about things that were important to her i did notice non verbals like healthcare
8259128 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8259129 i noticed that she does something with her shoulders maybe thats how she emphasizes
8259130 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8259131 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but thats so weak that we tend to miss it
8259132 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8259133 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth

8259164 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8259165 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8259166 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8259167 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8259168 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8259169 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8259170 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8259171 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8259172 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe

8259174 your oxygen mask is not supposed to inflate like a weather balloon

8259176 passengers travelling with young children should attend to their own mask first
8259177 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8259178 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son

8259207 violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent even obsessive theme of culture both high and low it engages the interest of children from an early age as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by grimm andersen and perrault are aware to shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic but deforming it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it

8259225 artinya barangsiapa yang melaksanakan shalat malam pada bulan ramadhan karena iman dan mengharapkan balasan maka dia akan diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lewat

8259336 felt like a big shot like a big big star

8259432 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8259433 that is not the same thing as having health insurance
8259434 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8259435 people are working harder than ever but the jobs they have dont provide health insurance

8259460 en muchas familias hay una cultura de la violencia como una forma v lida de educar a los hijos

8259462 hay otros padres que tienen una creencia de que los hijos son una amenaza para ellos
8259463 las personas que maltratan a sus hijos pueden ser personas que presentan alg n tipo de patolog as siqui tricas pero son los menos
8259464 en general son personas que tienen carencias afectivas que son inmaduras emocionalmente o que validan como parte de su control conductual con los hijos la violencia

8259474 ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia whose doctrine on its nearby neighbours is reminiscent of sphere politics
8259475 it is important from a stability point of view that the eu sends a clear political signal that ukraines integration into the union is possible if the country continues goal directed promotion of reforms in line with european values
8259476 but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbour and threatened its democratic government russia also cannot stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbours so it purposely created tension in the region

8259556 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8259557 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8259558 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8259559 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8259560 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8259561 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8259562 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8259563 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8259564 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8259565 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8259566 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8259567 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8259568 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8259569 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8259570 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8259571 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8259572 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8259573 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8259574 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8259575 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8259576 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8259577 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8259578 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8259579 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8259580 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car

8259582 weve seen our jobs disappear overseas our wages go down and the price we pay at the pump skyrocket to record highs
8259583 weve been hit hard but were ready to fight back and were ready for a president who will fight for us
8259584 there was a time when the democratic tent wasnt big enough to include pro life catholics
8259585 sen caseys speaking role is a clear signal that those days are over
8259586 if you look past the speeches to his record one thing is clear
8259587 john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8259588 but once elected they broke their energy promises to the american people and let big oil determine and even write our national energy policy
8259589 the only thing green in john mccains energy plans are the billions of dollars hes promising in more tax cuts to oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed george bush approach to energy policy
8259590 hes not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8259591 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8259592 gov rendells allegiance to special interests representing personal injury lawyers in spite of his own constituents loss of critical medical care is abhorrent
8259593 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8259594 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8259595 and i believe that as president hell pursue the common good by seeking common ground rather than trying to divide us
8259596 there was a time when the democratic tent wasnt big enough to include pro life catholics
8259597 senator caseys speaking role is a clear signal that those days are over we are hopeful that tonights address will begin to heal the deep divisions that exist in our country and pave the way for common ground efforts to reduce abortion

8259623 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8259624 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8259625 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8259626 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8259627 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8259628 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8259629 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8259630 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8259631 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8259641 after watching hillary clintons speech tonight i am truly sorry not to see hillary running in this election
8259642 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8259643 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week
8259644 of course were frustrated because we wanted to proceed further in the competition there isnt a man happy about the loss especially when we had a great chance to win
8259645 we will try to win every game in the acl to make up for the loss in the abc cup
8259646 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8259647 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8259648 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8259649 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8259650 no one works for someone we all just work together
8259651 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8259652 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8259653 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8259654 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8259655 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8259656 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8259657 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8259658 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8259659 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8259660 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8259661 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8259662 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8259663 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8259664 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8259665 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8259666 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8259667 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8259668 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8259669 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8259670 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8259671 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8259672 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8259673 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8259674 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8259675 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8259676 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8259677 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8259678 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8259679 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8259680 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8259681 he doesnt want to join either of them manchester city and everton and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8259682 because of all the problems there eastlands and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure he is speaking with the manager at the moment but he is settled in london
8259683 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8259684 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8259685 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8259686 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8259687 i want to be a team player and the coaching staff is making me feel very welcome
8259688 life really isnt fair and im not wanting to cry about anything im proud of who i am as a person and what i have accomplished as a player
8259689 we spoke for quite awhile about jeff and she let me know he truly appreciated this opportunity
8259690 his attitude has been right from the beginning and he seems to like it here
8259691 im really glad now to be with a team that believes in me i felt like a kid again
8259692 i see it will still take a bit of time for them to coordinate they need more structure and discipline on defense but i want to give them more freedom on offense to create right now
8259693 i just need to set an example and play hard there is always pressure as a striker to score goals right now though im trying to enjoy the game and the goals will come
8259694 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8259695 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8259696 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8259697 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8259698 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8259699 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8259700 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8259701 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8259702 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8259703 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8259704 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8259705 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8259706 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8259707 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8259715 an unorthodox country first lieberman selection would reinforce what has been attractive about mccain and what has allowed him to run ahead of though not yet enough ahead of the generic republican ballot
8259716 joe lieberman is a dangerous pick but he also has a huge upside
8259717 to me he wouldnt be the best pick but he wouldnt be the worst either
8259718 the domestic issues on which republicans and mr lieberman have major differences are pressing and cannot be ignored
8259719 students can work with professors who are engaged in the latest ideas on reducing climate change and producing new energy sources

8259723 sales have dropped significantly and the number of indisposed properties increases drastically in the past three months the drop is of 30 40 for the external market and 5 for the domestic while forecasts say that it will continue until the end of the year early 2009
8259724 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8259725 the future of the property market is gloomy due to the slowdown in the number of sales across cyprus the commercial plots and land are exempted since the demand by foreign investors russians mostly who want to expand their business activities to the island is big
8259726 the interest rate increase which pushes monthly installments up is the main reason for the drop in domestic demand which will continue in the next few months
8259727 if the crisis goes on lending will become more difficult for other professional groups too such as hoteliers and traders
8259728 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8259729 the way i see it the real long term problem facing markets with significant amounts of holiday properties is going to rear its head when retiring baby boomers start dying off lots of people croaking plus very few in a position to buy their second homes potential problems worthy of further analysis

8259748 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8259749 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8259750 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8259751 i came in and lost a lot of weight doing it it felt good i felt strong so it just basically started out by talking about it and i think actually henry blanco sotos defense minded backup catcher and one of his mentors might have bought some of the dinners for him and got him started on it
8259752 we have been looking for a site in lewes for some time and we are thrilled to acquire such a prestigious pub
8259753 our pubs in brighton are performing well and a move into nearby lewes was the logical next step
8259754 fullers always looks to offer the best pub in any area and we are looking forward to working with the local community to ensure the lewes arms is a pub they can all be proud of
8259755 the moment we arrived and sat on the benches at the entrance to the park an elderly woman arrived and told us it wasnt nice of us to take up the entire playground for her children
8259756 we didnt want to fight with her but other people began arriving and yelling at us one woman sat next to my brother in law so he would get up the secular jews surrounding us began arguing over whether or not we should leave some said no and some said yes
8259757 the children began to cry because they were frightened by all of the yelling around us so we went to the other end of the park where we thought we would have peace but they just followed us
8259758 what bothered me was that they just wanted to make us feel bad so we would leave i was offended it was excessive we heard it was a nice park and wanted to spend time there but weve never been so offended we were driven out because we are haredim my family and i will never go back there

8259788 una aspiraci n del gobierno bolivariano es que estas asociaciones populares tengan una participaci n importante en esta actividad

8259796 a las cementeras y a sidor se les puso una pistola en el pecho al decirles que si en 60 d as no hab a acuerdo se proced a a la ocupaci n
8259797 de acuerdo con la legislaci n venezolana en materia de expropiaci n no es posible que una propiedad la ocupen o a alguien le quiten el control de una empresa sin una sentencia firme de las autoridades judiciales pero eso se viol con las ocupaciones de sidor y cemex
8259798 con estos decretos se cre un procedimiento expropiatorio distinto al previsto en la constituci n y en la ley de expropiaciones por causa de utilidad p blica y social el cual contempla que no se puede ocupar un bien de manera previa ni definitiva sin haber iniciado un juicio de expropiaci n con la participaci n del poder judicial y sin que el estado consigne el justiprecio establecido en el marco de ese procedimiento judicial
8259799 las empresas extranjeras prefieren recurrir a la v a diplom tica o amenazar con el arbitraje internacional porque perciben que no hay posibilidad de que la sala constitucional declare la nulidad de las expropiaciones
8259800 se debi designar una comisi n de aval o formada por tres miembros uno que representa al estado otro por el particular que es objeto de la expropiaci n y un tercer perito que es nombrado de com n acuerdo por las partes

8259818 the president of russia is ready for confrontation with the west
8259819 is a bomb set between russia and the wests relations for many years to come
8259820 if our partners want good relations with russia they will understand the reason for our decision and things will be calm but if they choose confrontation well we have lived under such conditions and we can do so again
8259821 russia does not count on wide support for its initiative it is simply doing that which it has become impossible to avoid
8259822 formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is the fulfilment of a moral and political obligation to them no more no less
8259823 it is rather curious if one remembers that less than one month ago the kremlin actively spoke of the need to build a new system of european security and to conclude a new partnership agreement with europe
8259824 this means moscow doesnt intend to completely break with the west but is now ready to hold negotiations only on its own terms

8259855 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is nadhmi auchi
8259856 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
8259857 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
8259858 mr rezkos lawyer said his client had longstanding indebtedness to mr auchis general mediterranean holding gmh by june 2007 he owed it 27 9 million under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court m auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as 3 5 million transferred in april 2007 that agreement provided for the outstanding loans to be forgiven in return for a stake in the 62 acre riverside park development
8259859 mr auchi first met mr rezko after the 2003 iraq war and they have a business relationship
8259860 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe he in a statement from his media lawyers claims he is appealing against the sentence
8259861 a 2004 pentagon report obtained by the washington times identified auchi as a global arms dealer and iraqi billionaire who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principle sic international financial manipulator and bag man
8259862 the report to the pentagon inspector general stated that significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to bribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the american led mission to remove saddam hussein

8259865 the libel lawyer peter carter ruck who died on friday had a chilling effect on the media he was a chancer out for the maximum fee and he did for freedom of speech what the boston strangler did for door to door salesmen he established the idea that libel law was complicated and merited very high fees in the process he became very rich i like to bill the clients as the tears are flowing he told me
8259866 the name nadhmi auchi was just another name for saddams intelligence service or so we thought said nibras kazimi a former iraqi dissident who is now a visiting scholar at the hudson institute in washington d c
8259867 mr auchi is a business partner of syrian born businessman antoin tony rezko who has supported mr obama financially since his first run for the illinois state senate in 1996
8259868 in 1996 according to european news accounts belgiums ambassador to luxembourg charged that banque continentale du luxembourg a bank that nadhmi auchi and paribas jointly controlled until 1994 had handled personal accounts for former dictator of iraq saddam hussein
8259869 auchi has been able to collect british politicians the way other people collect stamps

8259873 the united kingdom has become a popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world because under english law it is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the united states
8259874 ala is concerned that foreign libel lawsuits threaten u s authors and publishers and our freedoms of speech and the press through its chilling effect such venue shopping also denies the american people the right to read and to access information another inherent first amendment right essential to our democratic form of government
8259875 a presidential candidate must be prepared to face extraordinary levels of scrutiny if obama and his supporters think they can silence questions about his background his leftist terror bomber backers his god damn america pastor his cocaine use his financial dealings with indicted syrian born businessman tony rezko or with saddam hussein crony and oil for food banker nadhmi auchi they are mistaken

8259877 the magazine should be forbidden from saying similar things forced to publish a rebuttal and made to compensate muslims for injuring their dignity feelings and self respect

8259888 we had no role in the team selection as a coach i think we should have more say in selection matters but here people with no knowledge about shooting have the say in team selection as coaches we know the shooters better than the selectors

8259961 akhil boxes with his guard down and that is something which i wont advise any youngster to follow but i dont want to change akhils style because i dont want to fiddle with his natural approach to boxing he has good reflexes and that helps him to relax and box freely with his guard down
