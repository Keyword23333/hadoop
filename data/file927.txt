9270000 you always want to contribute and sometimes regardless if you win or lose just going out there and throwing quality innings up there gives your team a chance
9270001 for whatever reason thats where the streak has come from
9270002 he was changing speeds spotting the ball well on the attack
9270003 any time youre going to have success its going to be because you got good starting pitching and your defense is good
9270004 hes done a phenomenal job all year and youve got to figure that at some point hes going to hit a bump in the road because everyone does
9270005 when you throw the ball down the middle i dont care who youre playing its not going to get major league hitters out
9270006 for the first few innings every time i tried to pitch inside it was right down the middle camerons home run was right down the middle sure theyre a good hitting team but when you throw pathetic pitches it really doesnt work
9270007 the most important thing at this point in the season is to continue to find ways to play well youve got to play tough every day were doing that right now
9270008 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9270009 you just have to be smart about your body and how it feels
9270010 were going to see how it reacts and the way it has been is good hopefully ill have an opportunity to get in there soon
9270011 thats the way you have to manage now if you did this in april and may you may run the risk of burning people out
9270012 but they have not been overworked theyve been good for us
9270013 obviously well see how he feels tomorrow and well discuss it
9270014 i was just trying to put my glove on it and do anything to prevent it from getting by me
9270015 i didnt ever feel like we had a chance to turn it i gave it a shot at first and we got him
9270016 he made an unbelievable play i dont know how he made that play let alone get two outs on it
9270017 i think he might have been just a little too far away to do a shovel pass
9270018 it was a little low but thats a play hes made many times before
9270019 we need to win some games and maybe spoil some people
9270020 its nice to do some good things and get a win out of it
9270021 you dont want to hurt them but if we need them we need them
9270022 im on vacation i dont got nothing to lose i got one more month left you know go to the house relax and see what my situation is going to be
9270023 as far as how we pitch him were missing our location on him is what were doing right now
9270024 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9270025 the other side is the best team in the national league we play everybody hard
9270026 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm
9270027 i kind of found it and started pounding the zone with all my pitches
9270028 ive already did what i am going to do in my career
9270029 even though im not walking guys my command just isnt there
9270030 im throwing plenty of strikes but the strikes just arent as quality as theyve been in the past
9270031 i looked up and i knew the third baseman wasnt going to get it so right when i hit home i turned around hoping he was charging right behind me
9270032 it wasnt a bad bunt and bobby can run a little bit too
9270033 it would have taken a perfect throw in a perfect spot to get him i was kind of shocked by it
9270034 joes a very good athlete and a very good fielder
9270035 he could have made that play you miss one play in a game and its a tough loss its not an easy throw
9270036 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9270037 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9270038 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9270039 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9270040 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9270041 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9270042 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9270043 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9270044 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9270045 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9270046 and you know moehlers going to battle he ended up pitching a great game for us you know hes a gutsy guy and hes aggressive and going to give us a chance we just had to get some runs for him
9270047 im an old man and i saw it with my natural eyes
9270048 that took a run off the board for us and probably at least a double away from a kid whos scratching for hits
9270049 i knew it short hopped me and i popped up like i caught it i knew it was a short hop i also knew it was a tough one it was up to the umpire and it was a tough call for him to make
9270050 thats not his game or anybodys game and he got it up and got nailed
9270051 i just had to make an adjustment and get the ball down i kept trying to pound the strike zone and get ahead and i was just missing a lot and falling behind when you do that theyre going to make you pay
9270052 ummm did you have a compilation dvd there of the apartment and annie hall
9270053 oh my fucking god do you realise how much i want to tongue you right now
9270054 yes very but hey two for the price of one
9270055 chico malo que vas a hacer cuando vengan a por ti
9270056 its a mystery its difficult to discern exactly what the problem is it doesnt appear to be anything structural

9270059 we want to offer 5 000 for information leading to her whereabouts or to her recovery
9270060 its moving toward an arrest but at this time were linking evidence
9270061 i did get hit out of bounds a couple of times
9270062 i compete really hard so when i get hit out of bounds i dont really know whats going on i just want to get back on the field i guess vince was right there he was probably talking trash
9270063 colt played as good of a game as ive seen tonight
9270064 theres a lesson to be learned any time you talk before a game you learn to keep your mouth shut
9270065 i know one thing theyre a lot tougher than we are
9270066 i dont know if my remarks helped their team if they did then i apologize to my team
9270067 i thought the whole defense played well after the young secondary got settled down at halftime

9270254 yeah i notice that guys who act all wussy never get the hot women
9270255 whats she doing with him im ten times better than that dude

9270261 the part that sucks is everyone expects me to show up at the mall looking like im on a photoshoot
9270262 i dont walk around in a g string and pasties i dress pretty conservative if they know me first then see my photos they are like wow howd you get that body im not one to really flaunt my figure unless im working or going out i just dont want any attention sounds conceited but true i started having panic attacks they are tragic like staring death in the face i want the attention when im working ya know not when im in a grocery store or with my sons they get really offended and protective i was that way about my mom too

9270267 i have just listened to your fantastic interview with david deangelo on double your dating and was really impressed with what you had to say and your whole approach to meeting treating women the reason you stood out for me compared to some of the other experts advice was the fact that you still treat women with respect in everything you do and youre still a nice to women without being a nice guy if that makes any sense i checked out your website and immediately bought date to win what a difference a day makes you are an amazing teacher and to be able to implement your stuff took me minutes not days of stressing out i can be me but as you say you will show me how to be a more powerful me

9270287 questa non pu che essere la risposta della citt di palermo alle parole di chi pubblicamente e reiteratamente aveva indicato al paese come eroe un noto uomo di mafia

9270299 the production team has stepped up their game creatively as proven by the strong ratings
9270300 this is the only show where truly unique and talented performers can achieve their ultimate dream theres nothing like it on television
9270301 the hard thing is getting people to be honest and not have it be a fluff piece because thats not what were trying to do
9270302 all about relationships the differences between men and women and the universal issues that every couple must face
9270303 faces a variety of mental and physical challenges which will test the love and passion they have for one another as well as their competitive spirit

9270305 i certainly dont mind a society with a christian world view so go vote
9270306 we might have done more for society if we had been good sunday school teachers of little bill clinton than if we raise a million signatures on a petition
9270307 not yet just wait though youll see just how sorry you can become but know no matter what i do it will never compare to the pain you caused to the person you hurt and all ive done its all for you
9270308 better just remember that you wouldnt have shit yet if it wasnt for me

9270317 most of the western press have misunderstood what happened before the war meaning most people think that georgia either fell into russias trap or that georgian president sakaashvilli was reckless
9270318 in the course of the georgian action there were no known atrocities
9270319 if the georgian attack was such a surprise as the russians repeatedly call it
9270320 how were they able to mobilise 80 000 troops on such short notice
9270321 at 14 42 georgian officers in the joint peace keeping headquarters where russian peacekeepers were also based suddenly left saying they were following the instructions of their capital
9270322 shelling of the headquarters started thereafter and an hour later we had lost 10 russian peacekeepers from the contingent
9270323 the georgians began shelling the capital tskhinvali at 22 35 using long range artillery and multiple rocket launchers
9270324 that the russians came up with such a figure so quickly within 48 hours gives solid grounds to question the accuracy
9270325 it takes a long time to gather accurate statistics on casualties not just from hospitals but also families who have buried relatives without reporting a death
9270326 but there is no doubt that the georgian attack produced serious civilian casualties as any indiscriminate use of force will do
9270327 one has to begin asking if when governments are increasingly throwing out terms like that whether it is diminishing the meaning of the word
9270328 who started the conflict is not an easy question with an easy answer
9270329 of course it was georgia that started it and the dialogue we have with georgia will have to include this
9270330 also on gas we must not make ourselves even more dependent on one side

9270395 we look after them with our pension money because it is our duty if we dont who would
9270396 there are still a lot of serious questions about barack obamas preparedness to lead the country
9270397 we are in the hunt for the white house barack obama is going to have to step up with more than a smart tongue snappy words and a nice suit
9270398 mccain really does admire and respect her and honours the campaign that she ran
9270399 this is going to be the most vicious campaign we have ever faced
9270400 lee atwater ruined the business of politics it all began with him
9270401 there is a reason why steve schmidt who was mentored by rove who was mentored by atwater is running john mccains campaign
9270402 corsis book has not really succeeded not like the swift boats did

9270408 quinn said isnt it amazing that the missouri republican establishment is unanimous in its unabashed support for palin a maverick republican who butted heads with the republican establishment in alaska whose position on earmarks fiscal responsibility energy and ethics reform are almost identical to sarah steelmans
9270409 i am thrilled with john mccains bold selection of sarah palin for vice president governor palin represents the direction and principle that our nation needs
9270410 as governor she has fought for the people of her state and for a government that truly serves them in alaska she fought against cronyism and corruption and restored faith in what principled leadership can accomplish in battling wasteful and reckless spending by congress governor palin called for a ban on earmarks even when they would benefit her state thats the kind of leadership america needs
9270411 at approximately 11 00 a m thursday august 28 2008 john mccain formally invited governor sarah palin to join the republican ticket as the vice presidential nominee on the deck of the mccain family home
9270412 at a time when americans want change in washington sara sic palin is a fresh and energetic voice joining the debate i am thrilled with sen mccains choice and i look forward to having this strong and independent woman who brings a lot of substance to the campaign
9270413 it is interesting to hear all of these liberals whine about foreign policy experience where were they when the democrats were nominating bill clinton a governor of arkansas to be president how about jimmy carter a peanut farmer from rural georgia
9270414 this move the day after obamas greek temple speech has sucked the air out of obamas 15 minutes of fame i predict that obama will end up back in the senate humiliated by a devastating defeat
9270415 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9270416 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9270417 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9270418 palin has more experience than obama biden and mccain all three

9270421 i believe we are at a crossroads and the next ten years will determine the future of this country in particular the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community is closer than ever to gaining full equality we are teetering back and forth right now and we need to act together to push us in the right direction what we are asking for is only fair and right we as a society lgbt or straight can show that civil rights are important and discrimination is wrong across the board through our vote i believe by voting for barack obama we will do just that
9270422 i think it is a dangerous thing that the media has been focusing on the divided democratic party hillary obama i think that is not true we had an awesome woman and an awesome man to pick from and we came up with barack obama and we are all united behind that and its a fallacy its a lie to put out there that we are not

9270433 performance as absolute and measurable as it might seem also has a lot of subtlety there are many elements and many tradeoffs involved in achieving performance that meets everyones expectations we know that even meeting expectations folks will want even more out of their windows pcs and thats expected weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area in windows 7 and ie 8 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams fundamentals
9270434 how much memory a given scenario allocates during a run as you know there is a classic tradeoff in time v space in computer science and were not exempt we see this tradeoff quite a bit in caches where you can use more memory or disk space in order to improve performance or to avoid re computing something
9270435 disk footprint while not directly related to runtime performance many folks see the footprint of the os as indicative of the perceived performance we have some specific goals around this metric and will dive into the details soon as well well also take some time to explain windowswinsxs as it is often the subject of much discussion on technet and msdn here rather than runtime tradeoffs we see convenience tradeoffs for things like on disk device drivers assistance content optional windows components as well as diagnostics and logging information

9270481 evidence further suggests that carniviora enhances the action of natural antibiotics produced by the body by reducing the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria
9270482 it thus is effective in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis candidiasis
9270483 additionally carnivora is being studied for its effect on infections caused by rna viruses including influenza hepatitis c herpes and hiv
9270484 i first discovered the venus flytrap plant in 1973 while traveling through maine to spend a vacation with my family i had just completed a
9270485 while there i had the opportunity to treat patients with many forms of conventional chemotherapy and radiation but was appalled by the horrific side effects i witnessed on my way through maine i stopped at a flower shop where i happened to observe a venus flytrap plant capturing insects
9270486 i stood fascinated by this process and watched for some time i recalled my recent experiences at schlossberg and reasoned that perhaps this plant contained substances that could digest primitive tumor cells and other pathogenic forms
9270487 now the pharmacology of venus flytrap extract has been extensively studied and evaluated in both animal and human studies and a variety of compounds have been isolated from this phytonutrient by sophisticated and universally recognized laboratory techniques such as chemical analyses have shown that so called naphthoquinones plumbagin 3 chloroplumbagin and droserone as well as hydroplumbagin glucoside are among the main constituents of carnivora
9270488 an array of constituents that support the bodys natural immune system and which have also been shown to be effective therapeutic agents for immune deficient and autoimmune disorders
9270489 the effects of venus flytrap juice could be characterized as immunomodulatory as demonstrated mainly by a decrease of
9270490 i have treated patients who suffer from the key in this instance is prolonged treatment i will tell you that a majority of my cml patients and all of my cll patients are still alive
9270491 inasmuch as im well informed about german alternative cancer treatments having referred american patients to that countrys clinics frequently i was particularly impressed with results achieved by dr keller
9270492 i was treated for four weeks with intravenous iv carnivora
9270493 this procedure has kept me in permanent breast cancer remission for over seven and a half years
9270494 all cancer markers have been turning up normal for me my immune system is fine im doing well
9270495 i had become totally disappointed with the horribly poisonous side effects of chemotherapy and was disillusioned with the oncology specialty i was electing to make my lifes work
9270496 there i saw a number of the venus flytrap plants in a corner and observed how they were catching and digesting bugs i was fascinated with their feeding actions and remained in that flower shop watching for at least an hour
9270497 my instinct told me that here was a possible treatment for overcoming malignant growths in humans for me it became worthwhile to invest study money and time in such a research project i became determined to do that little did i understand then that applying the therapeutics of juice from the venus flytrap would become my lifes work
9270498 in 1973 i discovered why the juice of the venus flytrap is such an effective dietary supplement for the immune system
9270499 as you know this plant is expert at trapping its own meals through a sensitive biological response process when a fly or other small insect touches the delicate hairs of the plants mouth it causes the mouth to close quickly trapping the insect inside the plant
9270500 juicy liquids inside the plants mouth are capable of digesting animal and vegetable materials
9270501 interestingly they do not digest the plant itself from this observation i have concluded that the venus flytrap must possess an advanced type of immune system capable of distinguishing between harmful intruder organisms and its own materials
9270502 i assure you that carnivora can be safely ingested and at low concentrations will produce the immune system supportive response noted by researchers and immune system monitors
9270503 the reason these results are impressive is that they show that the treatment works and is suitable to act as an effective partner to other nontoxic treatments that also work
9270504 for patients with early malignancies who come to me for treatment before undergoing any noxious therapies cancer remission can be achieved for almost 98 percent of them
9270505 after immune abilities have been ruined by chemotherapy or radiation is when cancer patients find their way to nontoxic therapies as a last resort holistic oncologists fighting to save lives this way are being presented with impossible odds
9270506 nontoxic cancer therapies alternative to the present poisonous and inadequate treatment methods utilize a patients immunological self defense system nontoxic cancer therapies regenerate immunity and readily kill off millions of tumor cells this happens not out of neglect or abuse of ones immune system but by its being nurtured bolstered and reinforced
9270507 the current treatment procedure for malignancies should be turned on its head with cancer patients trying harmless therapies first
9270508 only if nonhurtful care fails them might the patient accept the risk of cytotoxins because they may offer some small chance to stay alive for awhile
9270509 cancer is curable but not with chemotherapy or radiation toxic cancer therapies do much more patient harm than good and should be avoided if possible conventional oncological practices that employ cytotoxic agents are killing off the most important organ of an ill person the immune system
9270510 in cases where patients are either compromised by toxic therapy or considered

9270514 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9270515 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto
9270516 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9270517 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9270518 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9270519 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9270520 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up
9270521 when you have a veteran player like carlos polk who has been here and been a big part for us those are tough
9270522 we knew we were going to have some tough cuts at the end we have young talented players that are the future of this team and can contribute right now and can do things for us in the kicking game and do things for us in special situations on offense and defense
9270523 this is one of the three elite teams in the nfl so i knew it was going to be hard at first but once i got out here and realized i could play with these guys i had it set in my mind that i could actually play this game and play for this team
9270524 they are like pet raccoons what they do not tear up they poop on
9270525 they draft two guys at your position and its an eye opener
9270526 you know youve got to step up its my third year and the expectations have to kick in sometimes i knew it was time to do something
9270527 it kind of clicked for me and slowed down this offseason working with coach ross and coach bradley for hours watching film of receivers it just starts to click im confident that i can make plays when im out there
9270528 ive been performing well in training camp in practice and i wanted to continue to do it in the preseason games
9270529 i wanted an opportunity to play i got that and i feel like i made the most of it
9270530 we had a sense of urgency about helping ourselves in the secondary
9270531 everyone has talked about antoine cason and rightfully so but cletis gordon stepped up and had an outstanding training camp with the way people want to spread you out and all those things having those corners you couldnt ask for more than that
9270532 this league is a passing league and teams are going to spread us out and attack us
9270533 look at new england and indy and a lot of teams theyve got four or five guys to attack you with your secondary needs to be good and deep i know i can be a part of a group thats both of those
9270534 i just wanted to come in and show my teammates and coaches i could play
9270535 i think i did that it was a fun preseason for me hopefully its just the start of a really fun season
9270536 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9270537 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9270538 youve got to put it in a spot where only he can get it
9270539 it wasnt scripted or smooth hes in there with a bunch of young guys he had some pressure he had to handle it i thought he threw the ball away when he had to
9270540 billy volek has had an outstanding preseason and hes gotten better in each game you go out and 6 for 6 and spread the ball around on that drive mike tolbert was impressive
9270541 weve been playing very aggressively and they took advantage of something we were doing that might help us in the opener
9270542 the guys fought back and its always fun to win no matter what the circumstances
9270543 i left it all out there hopefully it was enough
9270544 i came to camp in a lot better shape this year and i was so much more comfortable with the defense
9270545 i felt like i had a strong camp if it doesnt work here hopefully i did enough to earn a job somewhere
9270546 weve watched all of these guys very closely for about four months now
9270547 we got our young players a lot of experience and a lot of experience in interesting situations it was good for them
9270548 you work hard all summer and do everything you can
9270549 its a tough deal all you can do is be confident in the work youve done for a while then you see how things play out
9270550 im still going to stick my nose in there and i wont shy away from contact
9270551 in the final preseason game i dont want to risk it some of the guys gave me a hard time about it but thats okay
9270552 we do it in practice and we do it in games
9270553 good teams take the ball away and its something weve done very well thats encouraging
9270554 my nickname is yogi and that was my bear dance
9270555 i was a little disappointed i didnt play more because i feel like i still have more to prove
9270556 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9270557 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9270558 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9270559 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9270560 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9270561 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9270562 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9270563 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9270564 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9270565 and you know its great that its the u s open
9270566 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9270567 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9270568 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9270569 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9270570 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9270571 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9270572 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9270573 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9270574 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9270575 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9270576 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9270577 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9270578 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9270579 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9270580 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9270581 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9270582 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9270583 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9270584 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9270585 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9270586 and i am also scared to spend a lot of money after listening to
9270587 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9270588 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9270589 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9270590 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9270591 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9270592 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9270593 my experience with jesse since hes been a has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9270594 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver brad smith can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9270595 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9270596 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective

9270608 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9270609 i still cant believe it i felt happy and more positive thats why i felt i could fight through
9270610 im not surprised im sure he will be a very good player
9270611 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9270612 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9270613 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9270614 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9270615 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9270616 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there

9270631 wir haben bei den j ngsten operationen festgestellt dass die taliban ber eine gesteigerte f higkeit verf gen zu organisieren und zu man vrieren und wie wir in diesem vorfall gesehen haben scheinen sie keine probleme zu haben sich munition zu beschaffen
9270632 frankreich ist entschlossen den kampf gegen terrorismus f r demokratie und freiheit fortzusetzen es ist eine gerechte sache
9270633 politische diskussionsforen im internet und zeitungs blogs mit kommentaren berschwemmt werden in denen sarkozys transatlantische neigung verurteilt wird die junge m nner in einen krieg geschickt hat mit dem sie nichts zu tun haben
9270634 wir h tten die jungen m nner nicht dorthin in den tod schicken sollen es ist offensichtlich dass sie in einem hinterhalt starben wie gejagtes wild
9270635 unsere soldaten d rfen nicht f r onkel sam sterben diese soldaten haben ihre pflicht erf llt aber sie sind nicht f r frankreich gestorben sie sind in dem endlosen krieg gestorben den die vereinigten staaten in afghanistan k mpfen um ihre eigenen interessen zu verteidigen
9270636 die zahl der opfer ist laut diesen soldaten vor allem auf die langsame reaktion des f hrungsstabs und ernsthafte probleme bei der koordination zur ckzuf hren
9270637 wir hatten keine munition mehr um uns zu verteidigen nur noch unsere famas gewehre

9270640 ganz klar glauben dass sie jetzt gewinnen und das veranlasst sie etwas k hner zu werden
9270641 die klare botschaft beinhalten die augenblickliche westliche strategie in afghanistan sei am scheitern bis heute verschlie en die westlichen f hrer die augen vor dem wirklichen ausma der taliban pr senz in afghanistan und ihrer f higkeit sehr schnell auf die afghanische hauptstadt zu marschieren

9270664 the idea to form a separate core group has been mooted recently to ensure that official discussions are not hampered while the leaders of the pro peace group remain busy with meetings and interacting with the masses
9270665 it will be a small core group of say four to five people selected from within ulfa that will hold discussions with various government agencies to see that the peace process moves forward at a good pace
9270666 we still have direct communication with our leadership which primarily includes ulfa president arabinda rajkhowa and its commander in chief paresh baruah it seems that they are also slightly getting convinced of whatever we are doing there will be differences of opinion but that does not mean that we have parted ways

9270671 we were so happy to get that bronze off that semifinals match the day before
9270672 it would have been really disappointing to go home with two losses in a row but we turned it around we were thrilled to have that medal and well have that for the rest of our lives
9270673 we started off a little slow and brought it back
9270674 i think im definitely at my best as far as understanding the game
9270675 im trying different types of shots lately trying to add some variety
9270676 i think shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best
9270677 id much rather share that triumph with a team member and then with my sister than anything else
9270678 i think the wimbledon win helped to change my mentality to realize not everything had to be perfect all the time

9270683 i wanted to win an atp event and i wanted to get my ranking into the 30s
9270684 i won the vegas event in march and my ranking was 38 in may so i accomplished both of those my real goal now is to end the year in the top 32 id love to be seeded at the australian open next year thats the goal i set for myself
9270685 a lot of things have changed the last two years
9270686 he wasnt playing a lot then right now hes a very good player with big potential and big serves its going to be a very tough match
9270687 i know i have to play very well if i want to win
9270688 im learning about myself and how i like to warm up and what routine i like before matches
9270689 my backhand is 10 times better my transition game coming to the net and beginning aggressive is better than it used to be its starting to show in my matches
9270690 i would sometimes let my mind wander for a game or two and against these guys if you do that it could be a set so im much more consistent and level headed

9270694 rodney moore has been in the industry since 1992 so he understands that to be successful it takes running ones business as a business he also understands the importance of supporting industry associations since such associations keep the best interest of the industry rodney became an asacp member over three years ago and has increased his support by becoming a corporate sponsor he has continually supported asacp efforts to protect children with its child pornography reporting hotline and its restricted to adults rta website label asacp is honored to have this industry leader included among its sponsors
9270695 its unfortunate that many uninformed and biased people automatically equate adult video with child pornography the fact is that nobody i know or have ever encountered in the adult industry would ever have anything even remotely to do with that when you hear or read about people being arrested for possession or distribution of child pornography its always someone with a mainstream job never ever someone in the adult business in addition to helping to fight child pornography asacp helps to educate people to the truth about our industry and how we feel as strongly as anyone that child pornography is wrong and should be fought
9270696 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9270697 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9270698 right now the chief minister will not touch the visa issue which has become extremely sensitive after he was refused entry into the us in 2005 the bjp had launched a scathing attack on the bush administration but non resident gujaratis told modi to go slow on the issue else they would be singled out in the us their second home
9270699 we are leaving for now because we dont want to sit idle it is very unfortunate whatevers happening i really cant say whats going to happen but i hope it works out for the best
9270700 we dont know when the blockade will be lifted and when we can return to work we have been told it may be possible to come back in about a weeks time so maybe then we will return
9270701 we had to leave because of the political turmoil at the project site we have never seen anything like this our bosses in japan are very keen to see the project through i hope we will be able to come back in a week or so after the fiasco is over
9270702 our contractor has gone home out of fear they the protesters are assaulting workers
9270703 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are not conducive for resuming work today we continue to assess the situation closely
9270704 we never saw this kind of protest in bihar they are having fun on the highway and inconveniencing common people
9270705 the nano project helps in the fulfilment of the common minimum programme for every additional car that rolls out of the factory five jobs would be created the project would not only lead to development of the state but would also produce a new demand centre for local produce and agricultural products
9270706 but it came as a shock to us we were only worried that the pace of recovery was not fast doctors last evening had said not to worry
9270707 within days of the passing away of his wife we have lost a couple that stood apart in high mindedness and public spiritedness
9270708 we cannot yet say the deadlock over negotiations has been broken
9270709 but whats an important achievement is that all the sides are now talking to one another they are doing it through us we want to keep it going
9270710 there is no other option but to timetable the final call
9270711 we cannot be expected to operate in such a hostile environment we wrote to her mamata several times but she did not respond
9270712 what gives us some hope is that each side has begun to realise that everyone can emerge a winner by tempering their individual positions

9270754 the take home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against mrsa
9270755 she will improve with a less specific antibiotic as long as she also empties her breasts either through feeding or pumping and if theres an abscess gets it treated
9270756 the physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has
9270757 we found that youre not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results then switch her to more powerful medication if she has mrsa

9270787 american issues project clearly has struck a nerve inside the obama campaign but even more important is the reaction of the american people who are starting to question why sen obama would have such a close relationship with an unrepentant domestic terrorist
9270788 the heavy handed response of the obama campaign definitely misfired the more the obama campaign has tried to bully the ad off the air with its spurious legal threats and intimidation the more voters have wondered what he has to hide

9270799 many buyers ask me about what is the best cheki camera i recommend all models because quality of pictures are great but i have to confess that im using this model i like pictures like everybody and i have a digital one but cheki is another experience like polaroid in their best moments but more funny and i dont have to show my pictures through a miniature lcd panel or wait until printing well cheki mini 7 is the cheapest mini 55 the top but i like cheki 25 varnished look and self mirror i can assure you that this camera could be the best gift you ever made
9270800 the kinds of people whom you select as your characters their attitudes and capacities the kind of relationships they get into all are going to add up to something

9270802 the xa the first model of xa series apeared in 1978 at the foto kina and came out on the market in next may

9270818 david que tierno esta bien no te voy a romper el coraz n
9270819 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because republican presidential candidate mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9270820 we love al gore we believe he was cheated in the 2000 election and that he would have been a great president
9270821 were proud that he keeps on serving this country and the world
9270822 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9270823 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities

9270887 there must be a muslim leader when the muslim army becomes stronger when islam has grown enough
9270888 islam is keeping away from disbelief and from the disbelievers the people who disbelieve
9270889 loyalty is only to the muslim not to the kaffir disbeliever
9270890 its part of islam of the correct belief that you love those who love allah and that you hate those who hate allah
9270891 it is not befitting for muslims that he should reside in the land of evil the land of the kuffaar the land of the disbelievers
9270892 some conditions can take you into disbelief to take the british citizenship whether you like it or not for these people you are selling your religion its a very serious thing it is not allowed to give allegiance to other than allah

9270908 id like that ukrainian politicians be wise and find a correct explanation to the developments work out a united stance of our state
9270909 if there is no unity on elementary principles it will pose a colossal threat to stability of any territories and our region
9270910 an infringement on any territorial integrity is an infringement upon our territorial integrity as well
9270911 and i would ask respecting our relations with neighbors with russia with georgia respecting the relations with the whole world to try to achieve stability and the rule of law

9270918 i dont like obscene profits being made anywhere id be glad to look not just at the windfall profits tax thats not what bothers me but we should look at any incentives that we are giving to people or industries or corporations that are distorting the markets

9270924 theres absolutely no doubt that if the reserve bank moves that all banks should follow there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time
9270925 so over time the banks will be coming down or should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserve rate
9270926 over and above that there have been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well
9270927 that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions and other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle

9270941 but when i drove him to school this morning i watched an amazing transformation in the car nick was speaking animatedly about something as we arrived at his school though i saw him scan the playground for his friends he got out of the car still buoyant with a bounce in his step but as soon as he caught sight of his friends he instantly fell into that slouchy i dont give a sh amble that teenagers get i think i actually watched him become a guy
9270942 how could this happen he came from such a good family
9270943 too many of my friends think gangsta is the way to go
9270944 but in my family being a man meant stepping up and being responsible that was what being a morehouse man meant to me i can live with that

9270953 bulan ramadhan adalah bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang haq dan yang batil
9270954 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya pada malam kemuliaan dan tahukah kamu apakah malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dari seribu bulan
9270955 siapa saja yang beribadah pada malam kemuliaan lailatul qadar karena iman dan mengharap pahalanya niscaya diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
9270956 demi dzat yang jiwaku berada di tangannya bau mulut orang yang berpuasa benar benar lebih harum di sisi allah daripada bau minyak kesturi
9270957 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka beribadah kepadaku
9270958 maka demi rabbmu mereka pada hakikatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu muhammad hakim terhadap perkara perkara yang mereka perselisihkan
9270959 dan hendaklah kamu memutuskan perkara diantara mereka menurut apa yang diturunkan allah dan janganlah kamu mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka dan berhati hatilah kamu terhadap mereka supaya mereka tidak memalingkan kamu dari sebagian apa yang diturunkan allah kepadamu
9270960 siapa saja yang tidak memutuskan menurut apa yang diturunkan allah maka mereka adalah orang orang yang kafir

9270966 sesungguhnya allah telah menjadikan bulan sabit sebagai tanda awal bulan jika kalian melihatnya bulan sabit ramadhan maka berpuasalah dan jika kalian melihatnya bulan sabit syawal maka berbukalah apabila penglihatanmu terhalang maka genapkanlah hitungannya menjadi 30 hari ketahuilah setiap bulan tidak pernah lebih dari 30 hari
9270967 diriwayatkan dari kuraib bahwasanya ummu fadl telah mengutusnya menemui muawiyah di syam
9270968 janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga kalian melihat bulan hilal dan janganlah kalian berbuka puasa mengakhiri ramadhan hingga kalian melihatnya pula maka jika pandangan kalian terhalang oleh awan sempurnakanlah bilangan bulan sebanyak 30 hari
9270969 pendapat yang layak dijadikan pegangan adalah apabila penduduk suatu negeri telah melihat bulan ruyatul hilal maka ruyat itu berlaku pula untuk seluruh negeri negeri yang lain
9270970 apabila ruyatul hilal terlihatnya bulan sabit telah terbukti di salah satu negeri maka negeri negeri yang lain juga wajib berpuasa
9270971 siapa saja yang menyeru kepada ashabiyah fanatisme golongan bangsa seperti nasionalisme maka ia tidak termasuk golongan kita kaum muslimin

9270973 siapa saja yang datang kepada kalian sedangkan urusan kalian ada di tangan seorang khalifah dan orang itu hendak merusak kesatuan kalian atau memecah belah jamaah kalian maka bunuhlah ia

9271294 the state cant give you freedom and the state cant take it away
9271295 the truth is that the whole business was so utterly infantile that the question of offensiveness almost didnt apply

9271297 a son is a son till he gets him a wife a daughters a daughter for the rest of your life
9271298 desear a una persona de la forma que se muestra en un giorno perfetto es una cosa que me fascina mucho no se comprende qui n es la v ctima y qui n el verdugo
9271299 en los peri dicos se puede leer acerca de monstruos que matan y de cosas horribles que pasan pero la pel cula muestra el esp ritu de estos monstruos que despu s de todo son personas como nosotros

9271304 it reminds us that there are unexpected consequences of co2 buildup and these can be quite dire indeed
9271305 people will more readily believe a big lie than they will a small lie
9271306 if we look at the vast segment of the electorate for whom abortion influences their vote and thats approximately one third or more of the electorate then we find within that segment that there is a two to one margin in favor of pro life candidates
9271307 theyve already started by saying she doesnt have much experience well you know what if i was the obama campaign id be very careful about talking about peoples experience because the relative inexperience of the republican ticket is in the second spot whereas the inexperience in the democratic ticket is in the first spot
9271308 we have a young evangelical leader who stands for our particular issues who will be now be a leader into the future
9271309 i t was a very courageous choice by john mccain
9271310 they want to present a woman as their vice presidential choice to further entice disgruntled hillary voters over to their side someone who is accomplished
9271311 shes articulate shes attractive shes somebody with good conservative credentials
9271312 so that will make a lot of people who arent overly enamored with john mccain feel better about voting for the ticket so in that way she sort of seems to be kind of a home run
9271313 the rap youll hear from the obama people if they can somehow pull this off with a straight face is that she doesnt have enough national experience
9271314 and if the media should sort of take that line and present without their own smirking about obamas lack of experience it will show what weve sort of known all this year that the media are sort of in the tank for the obama ticket
9271315 true character of a person can be judged by observing what he does when he has nothing to do
9271316 a weed is a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered

9271324 the ineptitude of top democrats in this state leaves me speechless
9271325 they claim to be for the working man but are only interested in using our money to pay for their political junkets
9271326 is this the only show youve worked on with such a zealous i e fanatical passionate fan base
9271327 1 how did you get into acting was it a lifelong goal or is something you sort of fell into as some actors do and how did you get the role of amelia banks
9271328 2 youve worked on several stagate atlantis episodes do you have a favorite episode and if so why
9271329 did your character get to beat up someone on the show
9271330 what other work have you done in television been working on in television do you have any plans now that sga has been canceled any particular hopes you had for your character to go into
9271331 1 when you first got on the show did you think it would just be a one time thing
9271332 sharon is that you in ghost in the machine it sure looks like youve reprise your role as a replicator im honestly surprised that you reprised that role after you were so firmly established as the atlantis tech in quarantine but in any case it was great to see you play two different roles i think its kinda funny that you play two very similar roles an atlantis technician and a replicator technician are you actually playing the same character a replicator pretending to be human haha i absolutely loved seeing you in quarantine its nice to see the nerd girls we dont get to see them very often nerd girls meaning females in technical scientific roles and arent superhuman like sam
9271333 so what did you think of playing the techy role do you get to do a lot of tech no babble not sure if anyone has asked this yet but have you watched a lot of stargate are you a fan of scifi do you think youre likely to do more scifi work

9271340 el periodismo en mi opini n se encuentra entre las profesiones m s gregarias que existen porque sin los otros no podemos hacer nada sin la ayuda la participaci n la opini n y el pensamiento de otros no existimos la condici n fundamental de este oficio es el entendimiento con el otro hacemos y somos aquello que los otros nos permiten ninguna sociedad moderna puede existir sin periodistas pero los periodistas no podemos existir sin la sociedad de all se deriva que una condici n fundamental para ejercer este oficio consiste en ser capaz de funcionar en conjunto con los otros en la mayor parte de los casos nos convertimos en esclavos de situaciones donde perdemos autonom a donde dependemos de que otro nos lleve a un lugar apartado de que otro decida hablarnos acerca de aquello que estamos investigando un periodista no puede ubicarse por encima de aquellos con quienes va a trabajar al contrario debe ser un par uno m s alguien como esos otros para poder acercarse comprender y luego expresar sus expectativas y esperanzas conviene tener presente que trabajamos con la materia m s delicada de este mundo la gente con nuestras palabras con lo que escribimos sobre ellos podemos destruirles la vida nuestra profesi n nos lleva por un d a o acaso por cinco horas a un lugar que despu s de trabajar dejamos seguramente nosotros nunca regresaremos all pero la gente que nos ayud se quedar y sus vecinos leer n lo que hemos escrito sobre ellos si lo que escribimos pone en peligro a esas personas tal vez ya no puedan vivir m s en su lugar y qui n sabe si habr otro sitio adonde puedan ir por eso escribir periodismo es una actividad sumamente delicada hay que medir las palabras que usamos porque cada una puede ser interpretada de manera viciosa por los enemigos de esa gente desde este punto de vista nuestro criterio tico debe basarse en el respeto a la integridad y la imagen del otro porque insisto nosotros nos vamos y nunca m s regresamos pero lo que escribimos sobre las personas se queda con ellas por el resto de su vida nuestras palabras pueden destruirlos y en general se trata de gente que carece de recursos para defenderse que no puede hacer nada
9271341 ciao sei bellissimo ti andrebbe di uscire con me sofia
9271342 what does it mean then to allow jesus to be lord of our lives just this whatever controls us is our lord the person who seeks power is controlled by power the person who seeks acceptance is controlled by the people he or she wants to please we do not control ourselves we are controlled by the lord of our life if jesus is our lord then he is the one who controls he has the ultimate power there are no bargains we cannot manipulate him by playing lets make a deal if he is lord the only option open to us is to do his will to let him have control of course jesus remains lord whether we accept him or not his lordship his essence is not affected by what we choose but our lives are drastically changed by our choice

9271436 the sco states welcome the adoption in moscow on august 12 of six principles of settling the conflict in south ossetia and support russias active role in contributing to peace and cooperation in the region
9271437 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
9271438 i hope the sco stand will send a serious signal to those who try to justify the bloody adventure of the georgian leadership
9271439 im amazed at the wests failure to acknowledge the fact that it was georgian armed forces who attacked peaceful civilians in tskhinvali

9271450 our main focus is to get rid of the insurgency in oil smuggling and drugs
9271451 we wanted to provide them with the battlespace they could call home
9271452 it sets them up for success to have an area for them to conduct operations and support our battalion
9271453 having them here to eliminate the flow of drugs and oil smuggling is beneficial because theyre denying the enemy use of the terrain
9271454 ever since theyve taken over the battlespace there has been a dramatic decrease of problems in that area
9271455 we have been benefiting from tips that had been passed from the iraqi troops and coalition forces
9271456 it was a rewarding feeling to provide care to people who have gone through so much
9271457 they are good people but theyre in a bad predicament right now so they need someone like us to help them
9271458 i feel very happy about the coalition forces coming here to care for me and my people
9271459 we feel a lot safer with them and the iraqi highway police around because of their protection and assistance
9271460 we gathered together to leave the country because the situation was horrible in baghdad and the rest of the country

9271553 august was dominated by a ridge of high pressure sitting over southeast queensland for most of the month while cold fronts surged across the southeastern states
9271554 this ridge kept skies clear winds light and humidity down the perfect mix for very cold nights

9271563 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9271564 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9271565 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9271566 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9271567 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9271568 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9271569 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line

9271579 its better to be a pirate than to join the navy
9271580 theres absolutely no doubt that if the reserve bank moves that all banks should follow there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time
9271581 so over time the banks will be coming down or should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserve rate
9271582 over and above that there have been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well
9271583 that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions and other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle

9271594 conditional sentences generally in this community have only been given out where theyve shown merit to do so
9271595 judges have acted responsibly and they have acted appropriately in regard to doing that in this community

9271597 theyre willing to throw people to the wolves for their own election purposes and i dont like that at all
9271598 theres a segment of society who believe that some of those folks are being treated harshly
9271599 but these are people who have treated society harshly and are going to face severe penalties
9271600 there is a belief by the average citizen that a sentence is a sentence these conditional sentences tend to be used over and over and over
9271601 there are some people from the law enforcement community and law abiding citizens who think judges have used their discretion too much
9271602 there is always the first timer who gets caught up in a bad situation and doesnt necessarily deserve to go to jail
9271603 there are crimes committed in jail there are drugs there are very little programs to get rehabilitated

9271825 ive been talking to all of them but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9271826 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9271844 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9271845 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9271846 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9271847 he doesnt look like the other presidents you see on money
9271848 mccains choice allowed him to wrest media attention from obama whose speech in front of a crowd of 80 000 in denver on thursday night is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever nielsen media research said it averaged 38 4 million us viewers across all major networks reaching nearly a quarter of all us households it easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of both of obamas two immediate democratic predecessors and the 27 6 million viewers george bush drew on the fourth night of the republican national convention in 2004 when he was nominated for a second term

9271856 love and life coincide without one the other is sure to wilt with one and the abuse and redefinition the other will grow sour but its the dwelling that defines and destroys life and love will shatter upon a broken dream like rain drops hitting stone this is the tragedy of the world lives lost in dreams without the hope of awakenment
9271857 love is not something that has to be studied to be understood but if you dont know what you hold then you can be reckless with its grasps on your heart i want to feel those freeing thoughts again and look into the eyes of those i love and see nothing but those feelings reflected rather than the faces of dissappointment or frustration lets run away from these times of difficulty and find ourselves with nothing more than the feelings that carry us on stand by me stand with me
9271858 lives built on mistakes can only grow stronger and know no criticism more than the one that digs deep at the root of the heart build on and dont let the mistakes of yesterday decide your tomorrow only you can decide how this story ends and i plan on including you in its ending until the last breath draws or the last image may fade from existence walk with dreams set in front of your feet and do not waste your time finding the things that you tripped over in its progress walk forward and never look back time can change a person and mold the inner core of ones heart spend your time with the ones you love so that your heart may be filled with joy and hopefully overcome every harsh word that may try to pull you down dont look to your leaders obey and learn their faults then build your own life accordingly if this path fails teach your children your faults and hope that they may overcome them the next time around

9271874 senator mccain has lost any chance of having a balanced or moderate ticket with this choice and has instead opted for the same business as usual reliance on the outdated oil companies that has been the hallmark of the bush cheney administration on the third anniversary of the hurricane that knocked loose oil rigs and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf coast that is bracing for another hit mccain is sending a terribly indifferent message by selecting a candidate who only repeats big oils talking points

9272445 co regulatory approach that could be adopted in order to facilitate and ensure co operation between internet service providers isps and rights holders to address the problem of illicit use of peer to peer file sharing technology to exchange unlawful copies of copyright material
9272446 the government recognises the value of the current discussions between internet service providers and rights holders we would encourage the adoption of voluntary or commercial agreements between the isps and all relevant sectors while a voluntary industry agreement remains our preferred option we have made clear that we will not hesitate to legislate in this area if required to that end we will consult on the form and content of regulatory arrangements in 2008 with a view to implementing legislation by april 2009

9272448 he could not tell them what the army saw when it marched back into atlanta the acres and acres of chimneys standing blackly above ashes piles of half burned rubbish and tumbled heaps of brick clogging the streets old trees dying from fire their charred limbs tumbling to the ground in the cold wind he remembered how the sight had turned him sick remembered the bitter curses of the confederates when they saw the remains of the town he hoped the ladies would never hear of the horrors of the looted cemetery for theyd never get over that the sight of that cemetery still gave frank nightmares hoping to find jewelry buried with the dead the yankee soldiers had broken open vaults dug up graves they had robbed the bodies stripped from the coffins gold and silver name plates silver trimmings and silver handles the skeletons and corpses flung helterskeleter among their splintered caskets lay exposed and so pitiful and frank couldnt tell them about the dogs and the cats ladies set such a store by pets but the thousands of starving animals left homeless when their masters had been so rudely evacuated had shocked him almost as much as the cemetery for frank loved cats and dogs the animals had been frightened cold ravenous wild as forest creatures the strong attacking the weak the weak waiting for the weaker to die so they could eat them and above the ruined town the buzzards splotched the wintry sky with graceful sinister bodies
9272449 ill talk frankly he said slowly but i wouldnt want you to be alarming the other ladies with what i say the war cant go on much longer there arent any fresh men to fill the ranks and the desertions are running high higher than the army likes to admit you see the men cant stand to be away from their families when they know theyre starving so they go home to try to provide for them i cant blame them but it weakens the army and the army cant fight without food and there isnt any food i know because you see getting food is my business ive been all up and down this section since we retook atlanta and there isnt enough to feed a jaybird its the same way for three hundred miles south to savannah the folks are starving and the railroads are torn up and there arent any new rifles and the ammunition is giving out and theres no leather at all for shoes so you see the end is almost here

9272495 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president

9272497 state house speaker john harris a republican from valdez was astonished at the news he didnt want to get into the issue of her qualifications
9272498 former house speaker gail phillips a republican political leader who has clashed with palin in the past was shocked when she heard the news friday morning with her husband walt
9272499 mccain said in april that he was determined to avoid a pick like dan quayle the little known indiana senator whom george h w bush put on his ticket in 1988 the choice proved embarrassing
9272500 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9272501 john mccain on friday announced a running mate whom he met only six months ago and with whom he spoke just once on the phone about the position before offering it in person earlier this week mccains first encounter with sarah palin came at a washington meeting of the national governors association in february according to a campaign provided reconstruction of how the little known alaska governor was thrust into the national spotlight the two discussed the position by phone on sunday before mccain invited palin and her husband to arizona to formally make the offer mccain joined by his wife cindy did just that thursday morning at their home near sedona ariz
9272502 1 hes desperate lets stop pretending this race is as close as national polling suggests the truth is mccain is essentially tied or trailing in every swing state that matters and too close for comfort in several states like indiana and montana the gop usually wins pretty easily in presidential races on top of that voters seem very inclined to elect democrats in general this election and very sick of the bush years mccain could easily lose in an electoral landslide that is the private view of democrats and republicans alike 2 hes willing to gamble bigtime lets face it this is not the pick of a self confident candidate it is the political equivalent of a trick play or as some democrats called it a hail mary pass in football mccain talks incessantly about experience and then goes and selects a woman he hardly knows who hardly knows foreign policy and who can hardly be seen as instantly ready for the presidency he is smart enough to know it could work at least politically many republicans see this pick as a brilliant stroke because it will be difficult for democrats to run hard against a woman in the wake of the hillary clinton drama

9272507 the us india civil nuclear deal would not be the end of moving the us indian relationship forward well do more work on that the next secretary of state will and so will the next secretary of state
9272508 you have to tend your relationships with countries it is important to make certain that you are seeing your key allies on a regular basis even if there is no particular crisis or work to be finished in that particular business
9272509 but if you can conclude something like that the nuclear deal youve pushed it to the next level and im always looking for the work that you can conclude to push something to the next level push your relationship to the next level
9272510 we set out at the beginning to try and improve extend broaden and deepen the us india relationship because very early on the president george w bush and i both saw it as an emerging big democracy and the relationships never been very close
9272511 and you can do all of the kind of small things you know not small things but expected new agricultural cooperation new cooperation between businesses
9272512 and so setting out to do that then puts the relationship on a completely different level
9272513 we really started pursuing the india civil nuclear deal in 2005 so there was a period of getting to know the relationship and building on what had been there before

9272549 but thats only half the truth if we think of the eiffel tower the statue of liberty cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark good visibility due to the size or location of the building direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea
9272550 it should be two or three years from now but you never know
9272551 past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays
9272552 one has only to think of the sydney opera house which took 30 years longer than intended and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue
9272553 planning wise it will be tight although l think it can be done
9272554 the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharouns berlin philharmonie built in the early 1960s which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one
9272555 many concert halls these days get designed in the so called vineyard style on several levels in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further with ideas coming from several sources including la scala in milan

9272572 with his record as with all my records i want people to roll back the rug and go for it

9272815 mccain supported this years amnesty bill amnesty for illegals thats straight talk for being in washington too long
9272816 i think we can set up a program where amnesty is extended to a certain number of people who are eligible amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20 30 or 40 years who have raised children here paid taxes here and are not citizens that has to be a component of it
9272817 i dont describe your plan as amnesty in my ad
9272818 amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20 30 or 40 years who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens
9272819 i support the latino and immigrant fairness act lifa negotiations between the white house and the leadership which endorsed more limited immigration reform have resulted in a compromise this bill makes meaningful but insufficient progress on amnesty for those wrongly denied it
9272820 pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing and doing nothing is silent amnesty
9272821 why would we want to pass some kind of initiative that a significant portion of our population considers an assault on their heritage

9272823 you really need to have a lot more people helping kids get their education

9272850 medical facilities in the phc were not up to par there were many lacunas and there was only one medical officer to monitor so many villages
9272851 then i noticed the mandal and the good work they were doing for the community they had started initiating micro planning in the villages and attended their meetings with their help we chalked down plans to improve the health facilities for the community
9272852 we met panchayat leaders and village elders to convince them organisng health camps wasnt enough as we still had to nag people to choose family planning we wanted people to come on their own
9272853 in the camp 97 out of 104 cases registered in the phc went for family planning operation 60 females and 37 males we also implemented the state sponsored savitribai phule kanya yojana where bpl families got money if they went for family planning after two girl children the money was in the form of bonds and girl children would get it when they turned 18
9272854 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete in many ways like usain bolt
9272855 i guess the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team and in my opinion you need to be committed 100
9272856 thats all facets of being an international cricketer and we believe for the best interests of this team for the best interests of andrew to have some time away from the game and lets try and get him right as soon as possible
9272857 andrew was very disappointed but he accepts our decision i know andrew pretty well and i hope he goes away and gets himself right because hes a very important player and we certainly want him as part of our squad
9272858 in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world so we have standards and they might be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9272859 i hope he doesnt take it personally because andrew and i are very good friends its certainly not personal and i guess thats why weve made this decision because we want andrew back in our team
9272860 we need to make sure our senior blokes are 100 spot on to the way they go about presenting themselves and that was an issue that wasnt being carried out with andrew
9272861 the statistics show a dangerous trend the scenario is quite fearsome
9272862 bengaluru is one of indias fastest growing cities but it is sad that a modern city like bengaluru with the best of amenities witnesses a rapid rise in suicide deaths
9272863 in bengaluru all are stressed out be it a child an it professional or a migrant labour the city does not provide social and mental security to its wide range of population
9272864 most of our callers suffer from stress and a sense of loneliness and deprivation often we counsel the callers over the phone and if one is ready to visit us personally we encourage them to do so till date we have counselled 3 600 persons
9272865 work related insecurity extended working hours and stringent deadlines contribute to rising number of suicides in the city no one has time for anyone we are all becoming very very self centric severing us from all human bonding and love thus a sense of insecurity is driving many to end their lives
9272866 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9272867 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9272868 i demand an immediate apology from michael moore to the people of south louisiana for his offensive and inappropriate comments
9272869 people in louisiana regardless of political affiliation are making plans to leave to protect their families from this serious storm and the god i know would not share michael moores glee for our plight
9272870 i mean i certainly hope nobody gets hurt i hope everybodys taking cover
9272871 and finally how suggestible is he going to be when he grows up
9272872 customers already spoil our toilets by either breaking the taps or by spoiling the floor installing cvm in toilets will be an added burden we cannot keep on calling the bmc saying the box has been broken
9272873 we are a fine dining restaurant we get customers from well to do families it is totally illogical to have a cvm installed in our premises
9272874 we have heard about it but as of now we have not got any confirmation if it becomes compulsory we will challenge them bmc in court it shouldnt be made mandatory
9272875 if they are planning to make it compulsory they should consult us every mall will not have enough space to install it
9272876 soon 3 000 more cvms will be set up in the city we will soon shift our attention towards south mumbai and western suburbs that includes malls and multiplexes
9272877 mall owners are very reluctant about the concept this is phase i of our pilot project in phase ii we may make it mandatory for all eateries and malls to have cvms

9272882 a child born in a glasgow scotland suburb can expect a life 28 years shorter than another living only 13 kilometres away a girl in lesotho is likely to live 42 years less than another in japan in sweden the risk of a woman dying during pregnancy and childbirth is 1 in 17 400 in afghanistan the odds are 1 in 8 biology does not explain any of this instead the differences between and within countries result from the social environment where people are born live grow work and age
9272883 economic growth is raising incomes in many countries but increasing national wealth alone does not necessarily increase national health without equitable distribution of benefits national growth can even exacerbate inequities wealth alone does not have to determine the health of a nations population some low income countries such as cuba costa rica china state of kerala in india and sri lanka have achieved levels of good health despite relatively low national incomes but the commission points out wealth can be wisely used nordic countries for example have followed policies that encouraged equality of benefits and services full employment gender equity and low levels of social exclusion this said the commission is an outstanding example of what needs to be done everywhere
9272884 much of the work to redress health inequities lies beyond the health sector
9272885 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
9272886 based on this compelling evidence the commission makes three overarching recommendations to tackle the
9272887 the real elephant ahem in the middle of the room is the unacknowledged fact that the dnc and their selected candidate abused the intelligence and trust of the party base and subjected the bases preferred candidate to outrageous abuse month after month in the primaries the blogospheres hysterical overreaction to the palin selection reveals the fear that their hate filled explicitly misogynist tactics will backfire on them and that a significant enough percentage of this disaffected base will do more than sit out the election in november but will actively cast a protest vote exactly how revolting the republican ticket is thats why we voted for hillary thats why we rejected the obama message of bipartisanship and content free hopey changey obamacans were the ones happy to play patty cake with these bastards and throw our economic and legal concerns into the toilet hillary is still out there fighting for uhc btw while obamas good buddy john kerry declares that a democratic congress isnt even going to try to get it in front of a democratic president
9272888 in my students view the olympics were great because they brought all the people of the world together furthermore everybody was competing on an equal playing field he also felt that the spirit of the olympic movement wiped out race class gender and sexuality issues in other words the olympics made all of these things moot and nobody cared about any of these things when watching the olympics
9272889 lets start with gender if you watched careful there were a few occasions when i saw events for men labeled in a neutral way i e the basketball finals but events for women were labeled as womens events i e the womens basketball finals isnt it interesting that even though women participate in most sports at the olympics the mens events are still central in most of those sports ive also noticed that some countries have significantly fewer successful women athletes and that is often related to the limited number of opportunities for women to compete in those countries think about those kenyan and ethiopian runners it has only been recent that women in those countries have been recruited and trained to run like their male counterparts what about patriotism and ethnocentrism as a very public sociologist noted in the thread last week the us media listed the medal count as opposed to the gold medal count china ran away with the gold medal count but i guess it makes us look better to note that we won more over all medals you could also see the bias in coverage for the most part if the us wasnt doing good in an even then the coverage of that even was either non existent or relegated to a sound bite
9272890 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9272891 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9272892 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9272893 the whole global economy will be weaker than the market expects for quite a considerable time
9272894 i would guess at least two years of sustained disappointment
9272895 if the global economy is going to disappoint the cost of holding them just seemed too high
9272896 i worry on behalf of the global economy at the consequences of china stumbling
9272897 the whole level of global imports and exports would start to drop
9272898 the potential downside could be abrupt leaving little opportunity to make defensive changes after the fact
9272899 thats never a problem its getting money out you need to worry about
9272900 but real estate is very cheap up there in northern south korea everyones worried theres going to be a war thats probably a good place to start
9272901 if youre sitting in beijing youre saying weve already lost two percentage points of economic growth
9272902 thats a big turning point for the chinese economy that means questions of profitability questions of unemployment questions of social stability

9272938 cheerleading and synchronized swimming like sage are noncurriculum related groups
9272939 the appellants challenge our previous findings regarding the classification of the cheerleading and synchronized swimming groups asserting novel arguments that were not raised previously we decline to address those new arguments and need not address the appellants arguments regarding the black achievers student group rather we conclude that the district court correctly found that the spirit council was a noncurriculum related student group mislabeled as a curriculum related group the appellants thus violated the eaa by providing the spirit council with greater access to communication avenues than it provided to sage

9272974 you will have great success in your career in the bathroom
9272975 there have been a series of rumors and tales circulating the towers and surrounding villages of late
9272976 there is some truth in what you heard and yes there is in fact a threat looming which could possible cause a great deal of harm to the realm and all within
9272977 the most notable gaffe was the mispronunciation of her last name on television and radio
9272978 several pundits called her pal in instead of pay lyn rhymes with van halen as alaskans call her even mccains spokesman tucker bounds got her name wrong
9272979 the link to the press release was not working as of 12 30 p m et
9272980 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9272981 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9272982 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9272983 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9272984 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9272985 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9272986 the government has no policy of blocking web sites accessibility to any web site is open
9272987 i just like the way he talks it has meaning
9272988 another thing is hes against the war thats one of the reasons i hope he wins because the war is killing us
9272989 fifa today confirmed that the match is cancelled due to the current suspension of the ethiopian football federation eff from international football
9272990 the ban imposed by fifa is illegal and eff will take its case to the international court of arbitration for sport
9272991 by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
9272992 for if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart and knows all things
9272993 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
9272994 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passes away behold all things have become new
9272995 for he who lacks these things is shortsighted even to blindness and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins therefore brotheren be even more diligent to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will never stumble
9272996 i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for my anger has turned away from him
9272997 our athletes have placed the country among the elite of countries that excel in athletics
9272998 we as a country and government are very proud of the achievements
9272999 the fans have repaid our success with their enthusiastic welcome
9273000 the link to the press release was not working as of 12 30 p m et
9273001 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9273002 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs

9273006 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9273007 i never thought id live this long to see this
9273008 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
9273009 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
9273010 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
9273011 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
9273012 if i am not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
9273013 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
9273014 and you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
9273015 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9273016 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9273017 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9273018 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9273019 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9273020 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9273021 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9273022 the theta dimension is at the fringe of contemporary science
9273023 i make brain sync part of my everyday life i cannot thank you enough for taking me on a journey of new realities and self discovery my thoughts are clearer im more aware and i finally feel like i know my true purpose in life without your cds this may have taken years more for me to discover thank you ever so much
9273024 guess ill just go home and listen to saaaad music on the phonograph
9273025 why why are you trying to sell girl scout cookies
9273026 this question really springs from the last week when i built a new comp for myself i read reviews searched forums had a few forum discussions and one subject that is pretty controversial for some not so much for others is the dual vs quad core in my case intel a good example of this is the intels e8500 vs say the q9450 and q9300 that was discussion in the tr review of the q9300 the benchmarks for these is certainly depending on which application that is tested but the quads isnt that bad even less then what their per core disadvantage in clockspeed would suggest although it might be that the extra cache manages to alleviate the clockspeed difference somewhat so my question is really if you could do a piece with something of the following dual vs quad when if ever will quads be able to really be on par with duals even in non optimized applications how are the overclockability between the two technologies
9273027 lets get it done in as few steps as possible
9273028 i am thinking about opting out for this month you have got to tell me i am not allowed to do so
9273029 biarpunmasalah berat sedang aku hadapi tiap bulan aku ada ritual khusus untukperawatan kecantikan seperti facial lulur dan scrub

9273032 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
9273033 yet in your brochures all i have is your cv
9273034 its always a compromise what you do in a brochure
9273035 you talk a little bit about yourself you talk about the broad strokes of your program
9273036 i asked about the riding and to leave aside the position papers
9273037 on your web site we can see mr beryl wajsman who was part of that banned list contributed to your campaign
9273038 why are people who are banned from the liberal party of canada involved in your campaign
9273039 mr beryl wajsman is perfectly entitled as a canadian citizen to make a donation to any party this is certainly within the law and this is a democracy that we live in and he decided to contribute to my campaign and i see no problem with that
9273040 i think the conservative government tried to slip in the rights of the fetus into the back door of this bill i think its very disturbing as a feminist who is pro choice as are the majority of quebecers im very opposed to this measure and i would say that its unfortunately also that a number of liberal mps voted in favour of this legislation
9273041 were going to sell you the stuff that makes you sick and then were going to sell you stuff that makes you better
9273042 right now this economy depends on us being sick we have to be sick for the economy to do well

9273045 es un tema de ndole rom ntico que presenta la historia de dos amigos uno de ellos tiene su pareja pero no la trata bien ah es cuando l le dice a la joven que le tiene mucho amor para regalarle es como una novela
9273046 el p blico estaba esperando este disco luego de dos a os sin grabar material in dito y aqu estamos trabajando con mucho amor
9273047 no debe haber ning n tipo de maltrato ni hacia las mujeres ni a los ni os ni siquiera a los animales rechazo todo maltrato
9273048 you know youve got a point i think that my mind is now made up
9273049 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9273050 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9273051 dit is de moeder van alle stormen we moeten maken dat we wegkomen
9273052 is that your son i see a scholarship in his future
9273053 i have to tell you this thing this may be my only chance
9273054 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
9273055 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
9273056 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out
9273057 kurdistan is part of iraq and we encourage iraqis living in the south and center to visit the kurdish region
9273058 we have very tight security we dont want sulaimaniyah to be like fallujah
9273059 the bible engages the varieties of chaos confusion and trouble that mere humans experience
9273060 can you taste the difference the psalm is sweet not bitter its full not empty you arent trying to grab the wind with your bare hands someone else takes you in his hands you are not alone
9273061 its a crunch for us and were at the maximum that we can charge
9273062 were not going to buy romaine lettuce or leaf lettuce for a little while
9273063 were going to have to stick to plain old iceberg for a while
9273064 with the turkey ham you put it on a sandwich add more lettuce cheese and tomato to make it a little more edible
9273065 if you have a couple of children you maybe cant afford to have them buy the few times a week they used to
9273066 i have two kids and you double the cost every week now its 3 a day so no way
9273067 were serving things that require a little bit more labor theyre a little bit more costly
9273068 were looking at what type of bread were using and maybe replacing it with something less expensive
9273069 it was a rather small offering there were a few fruits but there wasnt any cheese on it
9273070 they say they would like lobster and shrimp on the menu but unfortunately we cant accommodate them
9273071 epo wordt nu pas toegediend wanneer het hemoglobineniveau het aantal rode bloedcellen red onder 10 zakt vroeger probeerde men dit tot 12 of 13 te laten stijgen
9273072 vooral bij pati nten van wie we denken dat ze volledig kunnen genezen in een vergevorderd ziektestadium wordt epo nog gebruikt want het verhoogt de levenskwaliteit sterk
9273073 dat is periodegebonden ik fiets niet altijd met dezelfde goesting een echte verklaring heb ik niet maar ik heb wel geleerd dat je nog altijd gemotiveerd kan zijn voor een doel dat je in het verleden reeds hebt bereikt
9273074 erop of eronder een middenweg was er niet ofwel leerde ik heel veel uit die periode ofwel staken ze me onder de zoden
9273075 die eerste dagen waren nochtans verschrikkelijk ik had schrik om buiten te komen ik vreesde de reacties van de mensen ik was bang dat de eerste auto die ik zou tegenkomen met zijn lichten zou flikkeren ons moeder heeft me bijna gedwongen om op de fiets te stappen ik zocht binnenwegen fietste door de bossen om toch maar niemand tegen te komen bij de tweede wagen draaide een vrouw haar raampje naar beneden en begon op me in te praten dat de mensen achter me bleven staan dat ik moed moest houden ik kreeg de tranen in mijn ogen bij het naar huis fietsen moest ik bijna bleiten vanaf toen was ik zeker ik zou er alles aan doen om terug te komen vanaf toen was het foert ik steek me niet meer weg
9273076 het gaat niet zomaar om faits divers maar om ernstige zaken
9273077 witse wordt namelijk onderworpen aan een tuchtonderzoek de manier waarop hij leiding geeft en zijn relatie met zijn collegas worden in vraag gesteld die bezwarende feiten worden langzaam opgebouwd in de eerste aflevering is hij bijvoorbeeld alleen maar wat nalatig hij laat na zijn beschermende vest aan te trekken maar dat soort dingen verzwaart zijn dossier het onderzoek grijpt ook terug naar de dood van zijn eerste partner dimitri zijn collegas krijgen de vraag of ze zich wel veilig voelen bij witse
9273078 het zijn er steeds meer en ze worden steeds jonger
9273079 een meisje van veertien vroeg om een neuscorrectie ze was heel onzeker geworden over haar uiterlijk nadat ze uit drie scholen was weggepest
9273080 het corrigeren van flaporen bij kinderen van zes zeven jaar is het bekendste voorbeeld in die leeftijd worden kinderen immers bewust van hun uiterlijk het is dan dat pestgedrag ontstaat
9273081 in de puberteit komt daar nog bij dat de jongeren plots heel erg groeien het komt inderdaad vaak voor dat jongeren dan een negatief zelfbeeld ontwikkelen omdat hun neus plots heel groot is hun kin te lang of hun borsten klein als het hen kan helpen zich te ontwikkelen zonder complexen kan plastische chirurgie een goede zaak zijn
9273082 natuurlijk kan een schoonheidsoperatie bij minderjarigen alleen als de ouders het ermee eens zijn tenzij het om een ernstig onevenwicht gaat in het uiterlijk stel ik de ouders altijd voor niet te opereren voor hun kind zestien is
9273083 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9273084 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9273085 enthusiasm is why bush won the 2004 election over john kerry it allowed him to maximize republican turnout in ohio and other key states
9273086 laat staan dat we vermoedden wat er ons in seizoen 4 te wachten stond het enige dat de makers ons verteld hadden was dat we eindelijk nog eens propere kleren mochten aandoen lacht
9273087 tuurlijk ik was de dichtstbijzijnde ex verslaafde die hij kon vinden lacht
9273088 alle ex verslaafden denken er op dezelfde manier aan terug was het cht zo erg nee toch maken ze zichzelf wijs pas als vrienden en familie je vertellen wat je allemaal gezegd en gedaan hebt besef je ja het was erg onaanvaardbaar zelfs maar ja het was een way of life geworden ik w nde haast in de pub ik was ook aan alcohol verslaafd moet je weten en voor mij was dat de normaalste zaak van de wereld op een gegeven moment reed ik onder invloed met de wagen met mijn zoontje naast me de angst stond in zijn ogen te lezen en toen ik dat zag heb ik beslist om af te kicken
9273089 clearly the price of gas reserves have gone up there is an energy shortage in the world and the players are totally different and its really a question of size does matter
9273090 everyone thinks ever since ive been at qgc they think were well and truly easily controlled
9273091 im not sure that history will show that we are
9273092 the real issue is that weve got to develop the infrastructure to enable gas to be transported and we need to create an efficient gas and gas competition market
9273093 this is the lords way of doing this and that
9273094 the lord never said we cannot do this and that
9273095 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day
9273096 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9273097 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9273098 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9273099 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue
9273100 historically the september october period has been poor for shares
9273101 in fact september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares
9273102 no 1 be bold and aggressive on issues and priorities most important to the american people
9273103 no 2 make sure that people understand that barack obamas views are not in the best interest of the country
9273104 a strong record of increasing taxes on energy which is exactly the wrong direction for the country
9273105 john mccain issued one statement that was definitive clear and reflected the reality of the situation
9273106 in contrast barack obama issued three or four statements steadily evolving over several days essentially into sen mccains position
9273107 this was a snapshot of the value of having experienced wisdom and judgment on these matters
9273108 mccain was able to articulate what he believes in a crisp decisive manner
9273109 in contrast it was one of those instances where you dont see barack obama with a teleprompter hes kind of stammering wandering halting hes asked basic questions like why do you want to be president when does life begin and he gives fairly unconvincing fairly unclear answers
9273110 mccain has an extraordinary compelling story of accomplishment and service and putting country first even if it meant great peril for him physically politically or otherwise
9273111 obamas resume is quite thin at least for the purpose of someone who wants to be president of the united states
9273112 barack obama has not led the country on an issue of national significance in a way that has cost him anything politically he always toes the partisan line
9273113 everybodys for that that wasnt some act of courage to take on his party
9273114 they dont want to go back to school and not be able to be on the beach
9273115 if it wasnt the needles whatever it would be the weather
9273116 this was the gathering place for all the kids in green ridge
9273117 joe wouldnt back down from a fight he was fearless
9273118 there were no drugs or anything like that we played baseball went to the movies
9273119 the first principle of politics the foundational principle i learned in the 1950s in my grandpops kitchen when i was about 12 or 13 years old
9273120 once we spent our limit on penny candy from simmeys charlie roth larry orr tommy bell and i would head down to the roosie roosevelt theater for the 12 cent double feature usually a pair of westerns or tarzan
9273121 this was our first grade classroom we sat right here biden and bell
9273122 joe biden lived here for 10 years and in this house
9273123 everybody that leaves here they stick to their roots they have wonderful values religion is a big part of it and the kids all learned how to get along with each other because there were so many of them
9273124 i wasnt that smart even when i still had my full mind
9273125 i wish you were still my sunday school teacher because you tell stories with legos
9273126 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9273127 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9273128 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9273129 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
9273130 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
9273131 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
9273132 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
9273133 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
9273134 shes not from these parts but youre going to be as impressed as i am
9273135 she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
9273136 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good
9273137 it is sooo good to be here in steelers country
9273138 shes going to excite things and tell it like it is
9273139 i think hes made a wise choice im not a barack obama fan and this helps me to decide
9273140 just leave it to my friend john to say its about time the republican party put a woman on the ticket
9273141 and not just any woman shes not a soccer mom shes a hockey mom
9273142 i liked that but i still need to know more about her
9273143 my initial reaction was its nice to see a woman
9273144 but when i heard her speak and use hillary clintons very words about the glass ceiling i was insulted she doesnt get it women and men did not vote for hillary based solely on gender
9273145 i panicked when i realized theyd close after labor day so i started stockpiling extra quarts of it for over the winter
9273146 in some ways only being open at a certain time of the year may make the experience of coming here more special
9273147 most of our help are in high school or college so by the end of august theyre getting ready to head back
9273148 we really have no choice but to close because we just dont have the people to keep the store running
9273149 theres never been a set date that well close one year we closed right on labor day other years weve tried to stay open a few weeks beyond
9273150 as the town thins out it becomes a matter of diminishing returns you may have less people to sell to but the cost of keeping the place running is the same in september and october as it is in july
9273151 but im very big on quality and almost immediately after labor day it gets very quiet on this end of town you end up not having enough people to serve the customers you have
9273152 then at some point you dont have enough customers to make it worthwhile to stay open so we just close
9273153 we have one lady who religiously orders four dozen crumb cakes on labor day
9273154 she said she cant live without them and they freeze great she comes back year after year
9273155 summer isnt something you can put off its fleeting and there are certain aspects of it you have to enjoy while you can thats what i like about coming to the shore
9273156 the shore is an experience a moment a taste and its sad when its over you have to do whatever you can to get by without it until next summer
9273157 that money will mean so much to this community and to what we are trying to accomplish with our young people god bless her
9273158 i would go to the end of the earth to see her
9273159 but to see her speak in my hometown is a dream come true i love her she is such an inspiration to me and to everyone here today
9273160 but i believe he will move this country in a direction that creates a better future for every single one of us i do believe that a vote for barack obama is a vote for yourself
9273161 honey your love for this town is one of the most beautiful things ive ever witnessed in my life one of the most beautiful
9273162 since they say the waters will be here until the end of october im making a boat
9273163 we will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies
9273164 from tonight we will begin supplying them with cooked food
9273165 we have had nothing to eat except some rice cakes and palm sugar
9273166 nobody can say that the party isnt unified after the jobs that hillary clinton bill clinton and barack obama did in their speeches
9273167 obama showed that he will hit back democrats worried about having another john kerry on their hand were appeased
9273168 disaffected democratic women are not going to vote for an evangelical pro life creationist
9273169 there is plenty of anecdotal and survey evidence that not all clinton supporters have embraced
9273170 but in all likelihood most liberal leaning clinton supporters will slide over to the obama column
9273171 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9273172 we in the united states are two to three years behind most western countries at this point we may be gaining or not gaining depending on the rate at which their life expectancy is increasing the male versus female difference in life expectancy has declined over the past 15 years it was previously eight years its now five another positive trend is that the life expectancy of blacks has been increasing relative to that of whites
9273173 it was a monstrous tour de force that may sound like a clich but it was true
9273174 i can assure you that the toll increase whatever he comes out with will not be even close to what he proposed before
9273175 if we as a society and as a state agree that we need to fund transportation and we agree that the only real way to do that is by raising the money then we have to decide whats the fairest way
9273176 were going to confront it and make it a priority
9273177 i just hope its not an election year or leading up to an election year gimmick but its true reform
9273178 i can say to you that my words that i give you are yours to feel to keep and to be loved by i hope that this blog helps create the warmth i feel within me
9273179 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9273180 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9273181 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9273182 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9273183 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9273184 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month

9273186 we heard a loud kaboom just in that silent area where the ferry crosses and i said boy thats strange and i looked to my left and saw a boat engulfed in flames
9273187 it just was completely engulfing the boat there was a pontoon boat and another boat adjacent parked at the dock those seemed to escape the flames
9273188 what do i feel like making with the ingredients decomposing in the fridge

9273227 the total system we call the biosphere is so complicated that we cannot know in advance the consequence of anything we do we think we know what we are doing each generation writes off earlier errors as the result of bad thinking by less able minds and then confidently embarks on fresh errors of its own

9273289 also clinton probably was not willing to play that 2 role
9273290 i didnt expect much and i didnt get much because they dont want somebody there who will emphasize where theyre coming short
9273291 but no one likes a con man who doesnt know what we think we want
9273292 for on that day we first created a lot of customers
9273293 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
9273294 people said hold it we dont want our infrastructure owned by foreigners
9273295 our concern is that some sources of financing see this as a quick opportunity to make money
9273296 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing
9273297 it thinks there is a boatload of capital and when it is politically convenient it will be able to take advantage of it but the capital is going into infrastructure assets available today around the world and not waiting for projects the u s the public sector may sponsor in the future
9273298 look at the physical neglect crumbling bridges the issue of energy security environmental concerns
9273299 its more relevant than ever and we have no vision
9273300 incidentally i am exceedingly aware of my numerous shortcomings and they are indeed numerous but they have nothing whatsoever to do with anything youve said to me
9273301 actually all i could find were links to people claiming that shes abstinence only not to any credible sources
9273302 adamantly supported our cause since i first understood as a child the atrocity of abortion
9273303 i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life
9273304 i believe that honoring the family structure is that important
9273305 surely thats photoshopped surely the person whos running to be second in line for the presidency hasnt been posing for sex kitten photos
9273306 how does my comment question indicate that i have double standards
9273307 i would be equally embarrassed if an ex porn star were to become vp or p
9273308 the office of the president should be approached with seriousness and dignity and is not a place for porn stars and public sex kittens what she does behind closed doors is entirely her business
9273309 such a picture is very possible in the context of a haloween or costume party
9273310 i hate to provide oxygen to slanderous idiocy that targets a 16 year old girl who didnt ask for any of it but look
9273311 its funny i provide you with two concrete examples of people not doing the things you accuse the left of doing and you take them as further proof of your own skewed perceptions

9273316 you know im getting really forgetful this morning i was standing at the top of the stairs and i couldnt remember whether i had just come up or was about to go down

9273320 it has a lot to do with our need to be in control
9273321 people are saying i cant control the big things so im trying to control the little things
9273322 they say its on special but it still doesnt seem like a good deal
9273323 if you really stop and think about it a lot of times its not
9273324 if you walk into your target store its still fun its still highly stylized its still cool and hip were just being more direct with the low price
9273325 we remain keenly focused on ensuring our prices are the same as on all identical and similar products in local markets

9273331 they have mindsets like homeowners and understand the need for it
9273332 when you give a gift to someone youre hoping to give them something that they can enjoy without aggravation and without incident
9273333 we try to put the information that is most important on the outside of the packaging
9273334 we really want our consumers to understand the product that theyre buying and are looking for new ways to improve that process all the time
9273335 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
9273336 may be the extra nudge some women need to get started
9273337 i think the human psychological underpinning of buying and selling stocks is pretty universal for both the amateur and the professional
9273338 if youre a younger person with a much longer time horizon with much greater risk tolerance markets like this give you an excellent opportunity to put more money to work
9273339 establish what your needs are what your goals are what your plans are and the professionals will sit down and put together a program with an acceptable level of risk tolerance
9273340 you need to be well armed with an array of plans for all situations
9273341 you need to spend time educating yourself so that youre prepared for all different types of markets
9273342 people hold on to losers because they dont want to admit theyre wrong they think things are going to get better
9273343 when you go into a trade you have to have some idea of when you get out of a trade
9273344 at the moment you enter a trade you should set that exit plan up
9273345 if you find yourself rooting for or cheering for your stock as if its a sports team you have to step back
9273346 when youre anxious and youre stressed you tend to overreact
9273347 that tends to escalate your anxiety and makes matters worse
9273348 its very hard at that moment to start applying these principles
9273349 just because you have decided to become a self directed investor and make your own decisions you still shouldnt go it alone
9273350 you can get so deep into your own analysis tunnel that popping your head out into the sunshine is a great thing to give you some alternate perspectives on your view
9273351 when dad dresses the kids you can usually tell as a mom you may want to make fun of that but unless you want to have the responsibility to do that all the time you have to let that go
9273352 at work for whatever reason weve applied more management tools than we have at home which doesnt make sense because a family is an organization
9273353 weve never recognized the incredible cost of winging it which is what we do
9273354 initially it feels overwhelming but it brings clarity to the job
9273355 parents who work need to have that same mindset what are the things that are important for me to do as an individual and what are the things that can be outsourced
9273356 on a friday we will sit down and ask what are our goals for the weekend
9273357 i can safely say hand on heart that i have not been given the nod

9273361 i think he could say wow hes really playing well right now or he could be thinking he just doesnt have nearly enough experience hard to say
9273362 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didn t want to finish the last two tournaments like this

9273366 we have one or two bugs that are keeping us from going gold
9273367 let me say it as gently as possible your moral compass took a major nap
9273368 you asked your friend to move the speakers you didnt give him instructions or a manual your response sort of felt like beating a child because he spilt his milk if he had decided on his own to move the speakers then you might have a point and a legitimate column as it is it comes off as an xyz generation selfish reaction to a genuine attempt to help you at your party miss manners would not approve
9273369 the idea that the friend is legally responsible is ludicrous
9273370 the friend is not described as a technical expert in stereos and would not be expected to understand the vulnerability of an apparently poorly designed device sharp really needed to put a prominent warning decal on the stereo warning users to not attempt to move it while it was operating this should be thrown out of court and will also lose a friend the owner should sue sharp if anyone
9273371 in my opinion if your sensitive electronics cant withstand simply being moved while being powered you have a poorly engineered piece of electronics
9273372 have someone install a second zone with marine grade outdoor speakers with separate sound control hooked right into your system a little pricey yes but well worth it if you like your tunes and much more convenient
9273373 but if my friend had broken my stereo i would have paid for it myself if you would have asked me to pay the whole 400 i would have questioned your friendship
9273374 lower base pay and smaller tips are giving waitress and waiters the summertime blues
9273375 were focused on what people do every day shopping online and turn that into doing good
9273376 we get a lot of thanks from groups for enabling their members to offer support without actually making a donation
9273377 its a way to let church members know what other members are doing
9273378 and the church gets a percentage of the advertising revenue
9273379 its tough times for everybody and churches are not exempt
9273380 when you have times like these people have to make difficult giving choices and the greater need causes the churchs resources to be stretched
9273381 is a great idea and congregants will embrace it as long as they feel confident their gifts are going to be utilized efficiently and effectively
9273382 we understand that this is not something that happens right away
9273383 churches will have to promote it make it part of their culture
9273384 it has some appeal and were definitely going to look at it
9273385 new opportunities to raise money come our way frequently we look for things that are good for the congregation and good for the community

9273387 the protest was an abysmal failure with a crowd of about 20 profit bashing protesters far out numbered by press bloggers police horses and looky loos i was able to work unimpeded covering the pathetic showing until the truthers showed up for their youtube moment desperate to salvage the fizzled demonstration 9 11 nutball alex jones started barking at me and attempting to make a scene and incite a riot these are people who think the government killed americans and it was a big conspiracy this guys a fringe talk show host and he showed up at what was supposed to be a peaceful event
9273388 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster

9273392 heres a governor who may have served two years but her accomplishments are worth eight
9273393 shes got as much experience for being vice president as barack does to be president
9273394 that money will mean so much to this community and to what we are trying to accomplish with our young people god bless her
9273395 i would go to the end of the earth to see her
9273396 but to see her speak in my hometown is a dream come true i love her she is such an inspiration to me and to everyone here today
9273397 but i believe he will move this country in a direction that creates a better future for every single one of us i do believe that a vote for barack obama is a vote for yourself
9273398 honey your love for this town is one of the most beautiful things ive ever witnessed in my life one of the most beautiful
9273399 shes not from these parts but youre going to be as impressed as i am
9273400 she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
9273401 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good
9273402 it is sooo good to be here in steelers country
9273403 shes going to excite things and tell it like it is
9273404 i think hes made a wise choice im not a barack obama fan and this helps me to decide
9273405 just leave it to my friend john to say its about time the republican party put a woman on the ticket
9273406 and not just any woman shes not a soccer mom shes a hockey mom
9273407 i liked that but i still need to know more about her
9273408 my initial reaction was its nice to see a woman
9273409 but when i heard her speak and use hillary clintons very words about the glass ceiling i was insulted she doesnt get it women and men did not vote for hillary based solely on gender
9273410 this was the gathering place for all the kids in green ridge
9273411 joe wouldnt back down from a fight he was fearless
9273412 there were no drugs or anything like that we played baseball went to the movies
9273413 the first principle of politics the foundational principle i learned in the 1950s in my grandpops kitchen when i was about 12 or 13 years old
9273414 once we spent our limit on penny candy from simmeys charlie roth larry orr tommy bell and i would head down to the roosie roosevelt theater for the 12 cent double feature usually a pair of westerns or tarzan
9273415 this was our first grade classroom we sat right here biden and bell
9273416 joe biden lived here for 10 years and in this house
9273417 everybody that leaves here they stick to their roots they have wonderful values religion is a big part of it and the kids all learned how to get along with each other because there were so many of them
9273418 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
9273419 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
9273420 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

9273426 so they pulled their boats up on shore left everything and followed him
9273427 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god

9273429 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself take up his cross and follow me
9273430 any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple

9273432 jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness among the people
9273433 after this jesus traveled about from one town and village to another proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him
9273434 so they set out and went from village to village preaching
9273435 he told them take nothing for the journey no staff no bag no bread no extra tunic
9273436 go i am sending you out as lambs among wolves do not take a purse or bag or sandals
9273437 when morning came he called his disciples to him and chose 12 of them
9273438 when jesus called the twelve together he gave them power and authority
9273439 an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest
9273440 they found the eleven and those with them assembled together
9273441 the use of aggressive bullying between girls has been on the rise since the early 1990s based on issues such as physical attributes and social status

9273928 fight club 2 well apparently if you go in with that mentality you are just setting yourself up for disappointment if you intend to read any of these reactions like i did ensure you have a salt shaker handy all i am saying
9273929 the footage i screened tonight was met with disappointment and concern
9273930 im still excited to see the finished product im just a little disappointed could it be that the film wasnt what i expected or maybe not what i wanted
9273931 i hadnt heard this bad buzz the handful of people ive spoken to who saw the show reel either last night or this morning had generally positive things to day aside from some general skepticism as to what the films reported two and a half hour final cut will look and feel and play like
9273932 the movie is gorgeously mounted in minute period detail complete with swooping crane shots and intricate camera moves button has a burnished sepia polish
9273933 my friends had one unqualified positive reaction which was to the performance by taraji p henson as brad pitts adoptive mother but beyond that the button footage felt vaguely underwhelming
9273934 it just wasnt particularly exciting or engrossing one explained excellent visual effects old pitt as a baby etc and fine cinematography but with a kind of enervated waiting for something to happen quality the footage showed portions of the entire film the other friend said but in a way that kept you from getting into it with cuts coming too abruptly and so people were kind of whatever grunting and muttering on the way out
9273935 i sat at my desk and got all kinds of things done today

9274122 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka para manusia dari jalan mu yang lurus kemudian saya akan mendatangi mereka dari muka dan dari belakang mereka dari kanan dan dari kiri mereka
9274123 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaubatlah kepada allah dengan taubat yang semurni murninya mudah mudahan rabb kamu akan menghapuskan kesalahan kesalahanmu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam surga yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai
9274124 setiap keturunan adam itu banyak melakukan dosa dan sebaik baik orang yang berdosa adalah yang bertaubat
9274125 barang siapa yang tidak meninggalkan kata kata dusta dan perbuatannya maka niscaya allah tidak akan membutuhkan penahanan dirinya dari makanan dan minuman tidak membutuhkan puasanya
9274126 seandainya kamu berpuasa maka hendaknya pendengaranmu penglihatanmu dan lisanmu turut berpuasa dari dusta dan hal hal haram dan janganlah kamu menyakiti tetangga bersikap tenang dan berwibawalah di hari puasamu janganlah kamu jadikan hari puasamu dan hari tidak berpuasamu sama
9274127 inilah ketakwaan yang sejati adapun mencampur adukkan antara ketaatan dan kemaksiatan maka ini tidak masuk dalam bingkai takwa meski dibarengi dengan amalan amalan sunnah
9274128 kewajiban orang yang berpuasa adalah menahan diri dari hal hal mubah dan hal hal yang terlarang mengekang diri dari makanan minuman dan jima hubungan suami istri ini sebenarnya hanya sekedar menahan diri dari hal hal mubah yang diperbolehkan sementara itu ada hal hal terlarang yang tidak boleh kita langgar baik di bulan ramadhan maupun di bulan lainnya di bulan suci ini tentunya larangan tersebut menjadi lebih tegas maka sungguh sangat mengherankan kondisi orang yang berpuasa menahan diri dari hal hal yang pada dasarnya diperbolehkan seperti makan dan minum kemudian dia tidak berpuasa menahan diri dan tidak berpaling dari perbuatan perbuatan yang diharamkan di sepanjang zaman seperti ghibah mengadu domba mencaci mencela mengumpat dan lain lain semua ini merontokkan ganjaran puasa
9274129 dan tidaklah seseorang mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan suatu amalan yang lebih aku cintai daripada amalan amalan yang ku wajibkan
9274130 barang siapa yang shalat karena allah selama empat puluh hari dengan berjamaah dan selalu mendapatkan takbiratul ihram imam akan dituliskan baginya dua jaminan surat kebebasan bebas dari api neraka dan dari nifaq
9274131 carilah lailatul qadar pada malam malam ganjil dari sepuluh hari terakhir bulan ramadhan
9274132 demi allah aku mengetahuinya lailatul qadar perkiraan saya yang paling kuat dia jatuh pada malam yang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memerintahkan kami untuk bangun malam di dalamnya yaitu malam dua puluh tujuh
9274133 barang siapa yang ingin mencarinya lailatul qadar hendaklah ia mencarinya pada tujuh malam terakhir dari bulan ramadhan
9274134 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam jika memasuki sepuluh terakhir ramadhan beliau mengencangkan ikat pinggangnya menghidupkan malamnya dan membangunkan keluarganya
9274135 sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan batas akhir bagi amal seorang mukmin melainkan ajalnya
9274136 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam merupakan orang yang paling dermawan dan beliau lebih dermawan sekali di bulan ramadhan
9274137 alangkah buruknya tingkah mereka mereka tidak mengenal allah melainkan hanya di bulan ramadhan
9274138 akan muncul setelahku para pemimpin yang tidak mengambil petunjuk dari petunjukku amp tidak mengikuti sunnahku dan akan tegak diantara mereka orang2 yg hatinya adalah hati syaitan dalam jasad manusia
9274139 apa yg akan aku lakukan wahai rasulullah jika aku menemukan yang demikian
9274140 engkau mendengar amp taat kepada pemimpin walaupun dia memukul punggungmu amp mengambil hartamu maka dengar dan taatlah
9274141 setiap jiwa pasti akan merasakan kematian dan kami benar benar akan menguji kalian dengan kejelekan dan kebaikan dan kepada kamilah kalian akan dikembalikan
9274142 dan tiadalah kehidupan dunia ini melainkan hanya permainan dan senda gurau belaka dan sungguh kampung akhirat itu lebih baik bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa maka tidakkah kamu memahaminya
9274143 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan di dunia dan di akhirat dan allah akan menyesatkan orang orang yang dzalim dan memperbuat apa yang dia kehendaki
9274144 kita mengimani adanya adzab kubur bagi orang yang berhak mendapatkannya kita mengimani juga pertanyaan malaikat munkar dan nakir kepadanya di dalam kubur tentang rabbnya agamanya dan nabinya berdasar kabar dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam serta para sahabat ridhwanallahu alaihim ajmain alam kubur adalah taman taman jannah atau kubangan naar
9274145 kepada mereka ditampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat dikatakan pada malaikat masukkanlah firaun dan kaumnya ke dalam adzab yang sangat keras
9274146 kemudian dibukakan baginya pintu naar sehingga ia dapat melihat tempat tinggalnya di sana hingga hari kiamat
9274147 celaka engkau wahai yazid siapa yang akan mendirikan shalat untukmu setelah engkau mati siapa yang akan berpuasa untukmu setelah engkau mati siapa yang akan memintakan maaf untukmu setelah engkau mati
9274148 wahai manusia mengapa kalian tidak menangis dan meratapi dirimu selama sisa hidupmu barangsiapa yang akhirnya adalah mati kuburannya sebagai rumah tinggalnya tanah sebagai kasurnya dan ulat ulat yang menemaninya serta dalam keadaan demikian ia menunggu hari kiamat yang mengerikan wahai bagaimanakah keadaan seperti ini

9274154 remember when goldman sachs gs was considered the cream of the crop in the financial sector and could do no wrong after avoiding the subprime mortgage crisis goldman sachs justifiably cemented its reputation on wall street that it was the most adept trading firm on the street but just like everything else on wall street investors may have taken this line of thinking to extremes suddenly it seemed that any time goldman sachs put out a research report the call made headlines regardless of what the specific analysts record was when one of their analysts said oil could hit 200 in the not too distant future rather than question the analysts thesis as to what besides a rising price justified the increase in his target which had been 95 in december investors just wanted to know when recently sentiment on goldman sachs gs has turned negative as more and more analysts are questioning its king midas reputation in our weekly look at analyst earnings estimate revisions for bespoke premium subscribers goldman sachs showed up on the list of stocks with the most negative estimate revisions

9274398 thank you for being so patient with them i dont know whats wrong with them they just arent motivated to practice
9274399 so while god made you without you he doesnt justify you without you
9274400 beloved there is much we can do to open ourselves to receiving his favors
9274401 how long have you been driving do you not look ahead when driving why were you going that damn fast when any damn idiot can see that the street is backed up and why do you think cars come with fucking break lights
9274402 why because you werent paying attention and you were going way too damn fast and hit me which resulted in me hitting the guy in front of me
9274403 the reason why i refuse to take existentialism as just another french fashion or historical curiosity is that i think it has something very important to offer us im afraid were losing the real virtues of living life passionately in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are the ability to make something of yourself and feel good about life existentialism is often discussed as if it were a philosophy of despair but i think the truth is just the opposite sartre once interviewed said he never felt once minute of despair in his life one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance of feeling on top of it its like your life is yours to create ive read the post modernists with some interest even admiration but when i read them i always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out the more you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as being fragmented of marginalised what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses and when sartre talks about responsibility hes not talking about something abstract hes not talking about the kind of self or souls that theologians would talk about hes talking about you and me talking making decisions doing things and taking the consequences it might be true that there are six billion people in this world and counting but nevertheless what you do makes a difference it makes a difference first of all in material terms to other people and it sets an example in short i think the message here is that we should never write ourselves off or see each other as a victim of various forces its always our decision who we are

9274405 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9274406 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9274407 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes his mother and others who have struggled against difficult circumstances
9274408 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
9274409 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9274410 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9274411 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9274412 regarding the karl rove john mccain playbook you make a big election about small things
9274413 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich

9274449 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons
9274450 earlier today i ordered americas armed forces to strike military and security targets in iraq they are joined by british forces
9274451 their mission is to attack iraqs nuclear chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors
9274452 along with prime minister tony blair of great britain i made it equally clear that if saddam failed to cooperate fully we would be prepared to act without delay diplomacy or warning
9274453 instead of inspectors disarming saddam saddam has disarmed the inspectors
9274454 in halting our airstrikes in november i gave saddam a chance not a license if we turn our backs on his defiance the credibility of u s power as a check against saddam will be destroyed
9274455 if saddam can cripple the weapons inspections system and get away with it he would conclude the international community led by the united states has simply lost its will
9274456 he would surmise that he has free rein to rebuild his arsenal of destruction
9274457 the best way to end that threat once and for all is with a new iraqi government a government ready to live in peace with its neighbors a government that respects the rights of its people
9274458 saddam hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious debate currently before the house of representatives would distract americans or weaken our resolve to face him down

9274490 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9274491 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9274492 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9274493 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9274494 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression

9274565 but it lacked the force and spirit needed for public acclaim perhaps saint just was trying to set his own mind free rather than to achieve fame organt sometimes suggests the misadventures of saint just with his violent enthusiasms and resentments but the eroticism is heavy and few of the themes of his later work appear friends scarcely mentioned it and his enemies derided it the book was seized by the authorities in june 1789 and although it had been issued anonymously saint just was prudent enough to hide at a friends home in paris in the midst of the revolutionary upheaval saint just eager to participate found himself ignored neither a parisian nor a popular orator nor a leader of men he was also not inclined to approve of slaughter he did not speak of the storming of the bastille which he had witnessed until a year later when his attitude seemed reminiscent of that of the british politician edmund burke who opposed the french revolution saint just returned to his hometown at the end of july the provinces like paris were in full revolt militia or national guard units were spontaneously forming everywhere and saint just became commander of the second unit organized in bl rancourt but first he had to overcome the handicap of his youth and the opposition of local cliques as a militia commander he went to paris for the f te de la f d ration on july 14 1790 he did not linger there and later spoke of it in tones of disillusionment saint just realized that he could play the role to which he aspired in the revolution only by election to a key post as an administrator or preferably as a deputy he had however not reached the legally required age of 25 for most men the political clubs provided the necessary stepping stone but not for saint just who was never a club man doubtless because he was too overbearing instead he became the municipal corporation counsel of bl rancourt championed communal welfare and free trade and set himself up as a spokesman for the voters at the same time however he resumed his friendship with the woman whom he had been unable to marry and in defiance of gossip met her publicly he succeeded in establishing his reputation beyond bl rancourt in the district where he was considered an energetic and able candidate for the next

9274574 the differences between sen joe biden and gov sarah palin couldnt be more stark gov palins 18 months in office pale in comparison to sen bidens years of service to our country while gov palin has zero experience in world affairs sen biden chairs the foreign relations committee while gov palin supports big oil joe biden shares barack obamas dreams of energy independence and while sarah palin opposes a womans right to make her own health care choices joe biden has a long history of supporting womens rights it is clear that barack obama and joe biden will be the best people to lead our nation forward
9274575 heres a candidate who doesnt just talk change she is change gov palin has a remarkable record of accomplishment in her personal life as well as public life shes stood for principle over party and has record breaking support in her state for it shes demonstrated strength of character when faced with adversity its the kind of situation where the more you learn the more you like and respect her

9274579 cest certain que nous avons gagn assez nettement je crois que lavantage majeur que nous tirons de la partie de ce soir cest que le d bat sur la d fense marseillaise est ce quelle tient ou est ce quelle ne tient pas est clos pour lheure on reverra a la prochaine fois

9274588 there is a difference when your playing according to the flow then technical skills dont really matter
9274589 love is at the bottom of all we may give a reason of other things but we cannot give a reason of his love god showed his wisdom power justice and holiness in our redemption by christ if you ask why he made so much ado about a worthless creature raised out of the dust of the ground at first and had now disordered himself and could be of no use to him we have an answer at hand because he loved us if you continue to ask but why did he love us we have no other answer but because he loved us for beyond the first rise of things we cannot go and the same reason is given by moses deuteronomy 7 7 8 the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you that is in short he loved you because he loved you all came from his free and undeserved mercy higher we cannot go in seeking after the causes of what is done for our salvation

9274593 my son and his wife are coming to take me to lunch today youll get to meet my granddaughter oh shes just sweet as pie and such wonderful manners
9274594 jesus loves the little children all the children of the woooooooorld
9274595 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
9274596 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god to those who believe in his name
9274597 and when you pray do not use vain repetition as the heathen do for they think they will be heard by their many words
9274598 and it is appointed for men to die once but after this the judgment so christ was offered once to bear the sins of many
9274599 oh sorry i forgot to tell you theres another list
9274600 too often we are so occupied with the destination we forget the journey
9274601 i shall pass through this life but once any good therefore that i can do or any kindness i can show to any fellow creature let me do it now let me not defer or neglect it for i shall never pass this way again
9274602 the supreme happiness of life is in the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves
9274603 flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you
9274604 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting
9274605 i am more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of live than on the nature of those events themselves
9274606 space you dont fool me youre not a something youre nothing
9274607 every time something separates it becomes clearer what something is for then the different kinds of somethings can be compared therefore i will know myself better the more i divide into new kinds of something
9274608 this is nothing until now every time we separate something we found higher states of something but now we have found nothing so what happens if we separate nothing

9274616 if we werent grieving following an emotional loss something would be wrong
9274617 concentrate on offering comfort and reassurance with an older child you can share more details
9274618 it was important for them to know that the body will deteriorate they had to understand that she was not going to get better
9274619 your emotional response to the loss may be very different from your childs and different from your husbands everyone had a unique relationship with the person who died
9274620 children may be crying not out of grief but fear
9274621 they may be scared that their own mom or dad is going to die next
9274622 we dont want to cheapen gods comfort that he offers in times of suffering
9274623 through our faith were equipping our kids to understand their emotions and to know how christ gets us through these difficult seasons of life
9274624 it thrilled my heart to see them pray to receive christ
9274625 wed been sitting there visiting all morning going through the tract and for the first time they saw the scripture in their own language we established a bond and now we are sisters in christ
9274626 we planned everything so that we could retire at 55 to do volunteer missions
9274627 we actually thought at first god wanted us to go as full time missionaries through the foreign mission board now international mission board but he showed us quickly that was not to be the case instead he was calling us to serve through short term missions
9274628 i am fully convinced that every person created by god should have the opportunity to hear the gospel and respond yes or no
9274629 in order to do that someone has to go and tell we are simply trying to be obedient to what the lord has called us to do
9274630 i confess that when i first saw mussa and the mama i did not think they were going to make it well
9274631 but they did and they were a testimony to the people one older man said he could not come to the gathering to hear the gospel preached and then he saw the mama walking from hut to hut sharing the gospel and he got up and went one day we all stopped for lunch but the mussa never came back to eat he kept sharing the gospel this is a great example to us
9274632 it has been awesome to be on this trip and to share this experience with them they have such a love for the lord and ive learned a lot just being with them papaw always has some word of wisdom hes sharing with me
9274633 i would say to retired people dont retire just move on to what god has called you to do next
9274634 if you are still living and breathing you are a missionary you dont have to go overseas to be a missionary but if you do god will provide the resources and if he calls go dont hesitate go do it
9274635 ive known roy all his life all he does is run from his problems but of all the mistakes ive seen him make the biggest one was ever leaving you i promise you ill never make that mistake
9274636 pride doesnt win football games hard work wins football games individuals dont win football games teams win football games
9274637 its a cool place to visit but it aint home
9274638 jesus gave us a brain and he gave us a heart thats all you need if you concentrate on what you dont have you forget about what you do have
9274639 that guys gone i mean im still me but that character that alter ego is backstage somewhere waiting to get on stage the director has a whole other perspective going on
9274640 but by me and ice cube teaming up we were able to fight it i didnt want to do a throwaway mindless movie with fart jokes just to make 6 year olds laugh i want to provide my children with some substance
9274641 you shall not misuse the name of the lord your god for the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name
9274642 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows
9274643 but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
9274644 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb
9274645 what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun
9274646 after every major systemic war there is the hope that this will be the war to end all wars
9274647 those with the dream are always disappointed the victorious coalition breaks apart the defeated refuse to play the role assigned to them new powers emerge that were not part of the coalition anyone may have ideals and visions the reality of the world order is that there are profound divergences of interest in a world where distrust is a natural and reasonable response to reality in the end ideals and visions vanish in a new round of geopolitical conflict
9274648 the chief sources of global strife have been ideology nationalism religion and ethnic conflict
9274649 economics could now join this list because the balance of power is shifting
9274650 we need to pray for those people no matter where they are south ossetia or georgia or abkhazia who have been in conflict and are on the edge that they would find peace
9274651 i must have forgotten my bill of rights at home
9274652 once i started reading up on the faith and reading the quran its amazing how similar the monotheistic religions really are islam judaism christianity they all come from the same root and from the same place the same small area of land
9274653 let me make one thing clear as a place to begin
9274654 you gotta find what works with that group were working on quick because were not big
9274655 thats my job is to figure out whats gonna work and were going to work on it well
9274656 you just cant expect them to be as consistent as somebody thats been playing
9274657 theyre going to make mental mistakes the olderplayers wouldnt make
9274658 i dont reckon the coaching is much different i just give em all a hard time
9274659 i think we coaches have to work a little bit harder
9274660 we need them out there as much as possible out playing and on the court making a decision instead of us every time telling them everything establishing that we trust them to try something
9274661 we have a pretty evened out team of juniors and seniors now
9274662 no one had an attitude at the ashley summer slam scrimmage and thats the one thing i was looking forward to seeing and everyone was happy and jolly and that was good to see
9274663 you need to be getting your butts moving out of new orleans now

9274667 when thinking about politics and government do you consider yourself to be very conservative somewhat conservative moderate somewhat liberal very liberal unsure refused
9274668 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
9274669 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention

9274774 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9274775 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9274776 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her

9274802 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9274803 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9274804 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9274805 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9274806 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9274807 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9274808 tomorrows summit must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas

9274829 baseball betting systems at large how to manage and implement them
9274830 above all we in the baseball betting architecture field have a guide that will serve as the foundation of any large project
9274831 and im going to be setting up a special hearing to inform my superiors and subordinates alike about the topics covered in this all important baseball betting manual
9274832 were not talking about the saturday night movie theatre crowd were talking about seasoned technology professionals with years of coding and design experience
9274833 i agree with nicolaysen walch i think this baseball betting instructional manual is first rate my colleague englehart dienhart may think otherwise but i think we can both agree that this is a quality work that will help de mistify the world of baseball betting programming architecture
9274834 the middle chapters of the baseball betting book are my favorite
9274835 i learned many new things about how to manage large baseball betting operating structures in the workplace which are key to getting the job done quick and dirty
9274836 im think beard ramsbottoms work will be the new bible of the baseball betting programming industry finally we have something that explains the core principles in both technical and graphical models that allow us to communicate effectively to our employees and executive management
9274837 im excited that our company took on the task of publishing this all important baseball betting work
9274838 were going to make substantial profits and the author will be cashing in for sure
9274839 dont let the criticisms of banas rheingold get in the way of this great baseball betting resource
9274840 christoph joas doesnt quite get it this is a big picture project that is meant to solve macro level problems not address minor programming and design idiosyncracies that pop up when running a live baseball betting project
9274841 all of us to support each other help each other out
9274842 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus all of us who are mature should take such a view of things and if on some point you think differently that too god will make clear to you

9274866 we advise you to exercise caution and monitor developments that might affect your safety in the united states because of the risk of terrorism the department of foreign affairs and trade said in a travel advisory
9274867 the united states department of homeland securitys advisory system threat level is at orange for all domestic and international flights indicating a high risk of terrorist attack it said
9274868 it is at yellow or elevated for all other sectors indicating a significant risk of terrorist attack

9274875 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9274876 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9274877 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9274878 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9274879 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9274880 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9274881 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9274882 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9274883 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9274884 everything is getting worse there are more kidnappings and more murders
9274885 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry

9274887 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9275168 i was wondering when there was going to be a positive strong african american in my lifetime
9275169 i think that was just to get the female voters

9275177 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9275178 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9275179 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9275180 she brings her voice of new energy and change and she knows alaska

9275186 we continue to show steady growth despite the slowdown in the global economy thus far in 2008 our fuel subsidiaries both in israel and europe performed well as a result of the successful fuel retail strategy we have put in place focusing on convenience stores and capitalizing on economies of scale in addition our automotive holdings continued to perform well with strong growth in sales however the ongoing refining margin erosion in the us as well as the weaker financial and real estate sectors offset this strong growth in addition the high inflation rate in israel negatively impacted our bottom line by increasing our financial expenses
9275187 despite these challenges our cash position remains very strong standing at nis 1 3 billion we continue to see substantial opportunities for the group particularly in the areas of energy and infrastructure and in this regard we recently raised an additional nis 420 million with our ability to leverage our broad experience and global presence supported by our strong and yet diversified asset base we believe we are well positioned to build and create long term shareholder value our strong commitment to this goal is also very much demonstrated by the recent share buy back program we commenced having purchased 112 000 shares for nis 48 million since july 2008
9275188 this made it the coolest august in terms of daytime temperatures since records began at the current site in 2000
9275189 in fact on the 18th the temperature struggled to just 17 degrees the coldest august day in three years
9275190 august was dominated by a ridge of high pressure sitting over southeast queensland for most of the month while cold fronts surged across the southeastern states
9275191 this ridge kept skies clear winds light and humidity down the perfect mix for very cold nights
9275192 these cold nights were then followed by cool sunny days

9275199 the supreme happiness of life is in the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves
9275200 flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you
9275201 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting

9275217 an extra judicial confession if voluntary and true and made in a fit state of mind can be relied upon by the court the value of the evidence as to confession like any other evidence depends upon the veracity of the witness to whom it has been made
9275218 it would depend on the nature of the circumstances the time when the confession was made and the credibility of the witnesses who speak of such a confession
9275219 after subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility
9275220 the bligh labor government is engaged in a very big con job about its appalling record in planning for and managing the states public health system
9275221 managing a public health system isnt as simple as changing the definitions of words
9275222 sick people need real doctors and nurses not spin doctors
9275223 seriously ill and injured people in emergency departments need real hospital beds not tables and chairs and the odd trolley
9275224 this is a nationally consistent definition of how you count beds and bed alternatives
9275225 these chairs are the appropriate way to treat a number of different illnesses
9275226 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day
9275227 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9275228 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9275229 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9275230 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue
9275231 historically the september october period has been poor for shares
9275232 in fact september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares
9275233 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9275234 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9275235 what they the pad are trying to do now is overthrow the government

9275238 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people

9275255 you have to keep your best 53 players this gives us great depth along the defensive front we believe there was too much of a risk to consider releasing some of the young linemen
9275256 there was some tough calls some of the receivers did a nice job for us a couple of those blockers are pretty solid guys
9275257 theyre a physical athletic team great running back experienced quarterback very physical up front theyre going to make you stop the run its power football
9275258 defensively theyre physical there they can run well good cover guys in the secondary good tacklers in the secondary
9275259 theyre well coached in all phases of the game its a good group their losses last year were very close losses i think all within a touchdown so they played a lot of close games theyre very well coached a very physical team
9275260 its not just us its all the programs around the big ten
9275261 were all getting faster a lot of people overlook the big ten for speed but we definitely have it
9275262 and i thought we were going to spend some time together today
9275263 whether it was turning the ball over or penalties we cant do that
9275264 we believe there was too much of a risk to consider releasing some of the young linemen

9275269 we can put up power numbers as good as anybody else weve just got to stay in the zone and work for good pitches
9275270 we said before the game we hoped these guys felt comfortable with it being kenny rogers and having had some success against him
9275271 we were talking in the dugout maybe we should save some of the runs
9275272 but well take em we finally got some clutch hits and put something together we looked up in the sixth inning and had zero guys left on base which is just kind of the polar opposite of what weve been doing
9275273 once they get something going especially with that team the power that they have the quality hitters that they have if you can just give up a one spot in an inning thats the biggest key
9275274 he did a real good job of damage control and not allowing it to carry over into big innings
9275275 nick taped my left one because it was sore and taped the right one too
9275276 i couldve broken that ankle somebody up there is looking out for me today
9275277 as a manager you accept that i thought he was fair in saying he would check they said foul ball and theres nothing i can do about it
9275278 if they were going to have it i was hoping to be on the field the first time theyve used it but it was pretty clearly foul
9275279 it didnt look like we were playing very fast at times and maybe some of it was because we were overthinking
9275280 weve executed better in practice and we knew there were going to be some nerves our freshmen at times showed those nerves unfortunately were going to have some growing pains
9275281 i told the team i was proud of the way they competed
9275282 i dont want anybody pointing fingers theres a lot of negatives we gotta get corrected as long as we keep a good attitude well be ok
9275283 i didnt know what to expect but all the worries i had i saw so that worries me
9275284 im not encouraged by a whole lot but the biggest thing is they hung in there i expected less mistakes but it aint completely broke and thats our job to get it straight
9275285 i dont know where i am with that but well figure it out
9275286 it was bothering me before i went on the dl
9275287 i thought the dl stint would help it because i didnt do any throwing during the dl stint
9275288 youre expected to go out and entertain and represent your team a lot of guys in here are trying to find something to motivate themselves for me its easy
9275289 i can understand that its tough leaving toronto being canadian and playing for a canadian team but when they told me i was going to philly i was like nice going to a ballpark where i enjoy playing in
9275290 consequently we get an experienced guy that can play some and hit off the bench cant hurt
9275291 we had claimed him off waivers so they couldnt do anything with him the only place they could move him was to us either they had to take the deal with us or keep him on the roster
9275292 i love pinch hitting its a situation where you usually pinch hit in a situation where the game is on the line
9275293 its fun to be in that atmosphere of being in the playoff race again its nice to see this team loose and having fun because ive been on teams before when you get in a race and everybody gets tight

9275295 theyll be minor things but things could pick up in the next day or two
9275296 unfortunately i think i made a bad decision of trying to play through some inflammation in my knee and it has cost me and cost the team a couple of games
9275297 hopefully its just a couple of days three four five days
9275298 when im healthy im going to get a lot of people out
9275299 i dont want to back down i want to keep going but you have to look at the best interests of the team right now i dont think its the best thing to go out there because i am not 100 percent

9275302 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus all of us who are mature should take such a view of things and if on some point you think differently that too god will make clear to you

9275304 not necessarily during ramadan it reports did not say when they will launch the attacks but we have information we have received information that they have such plans
9275305 we dont expect them to be religiously observing their practices during the holy month of ramadan
9275306 there is no instruction for us to stop the pursuit operation against the group of bravo and kato because we cannot postpone the enforcement of laws while at the same time there is an instruction to make some tactical adjustments so that our muslim brothers and sisters can observe their religious practices during the holy month of ramadan unhampered

9275341 i offer you a series of posts describing in depth my research into what it takes to deliver a systems architecture with the following traits
9275342 man is this project in the right place at the right time
9275343 what isnt entirely obvious in the above graphs these spikes happen inside 60 seconds the idea of provisioning more servers virtual or not is unrealistic even in a cloud computing system getting new system images up and integrated in 60 seconds is pushing the envelope and that would assume a zero second response time this means it is about time to adjust what our systems architecture should support the old rule of 70 utilization accommodating an unexpected 40 increase in traffic is unraveling at least eight times in the past month weve experienced from 100 to 1000 sudden increases in traffic across many of our clients
9275344 well of course these types of things are inevitable who could possibly predict every possible negative influence on an application much less a data center
9275345 well there you go the cloud is not ready for production
9275346 people rankled about 5 hours of downtime should try providing the same level of service in my experience its much easier to write off your own mistakes and most organizations do than it is to understand someone elses even when theyre doing a better job than you would
9275347 8 ip addressing will move to ipv6 or have ipv4 rfcs standardized that allow for a global address device vm id within the addressing space and a location provider sensitive id that will allow for workload to be moved from one provider to another without changing the clients host stack or known ip address in flight heres an example from my friend dino 9 this will allow workload portability between enterprise clouds and service provider clouds 10 the sp community will embrace this and start aggressively trying to capture as much footprint as possible so they can fill their data centers to near capacity allowing for them to have the maximum efficiency within their operation this holds to my rule that the value of virtualization is compounded by the number of devices virtualized 11 someone will write a dns or a dns coupled workload exchange this will allow the enterprise to effectively automate the bidding of workload allocation against some number or pool of service providers who are offering them the compute storage and network capacity at a given price the faster and more seamless the above technologies make the shift of workload from one provider to another the simpler it is in the end for an exchange or market based system to be the controlling authority for the distribution of workload and thus s to the provider who is most capable of processing the workload
9275348 in summary the network is a computer and if you think thats just a smart ass bit of word play its not
9275349 ciscos vision which can become reality with the nexus is of a data center that is no longer defined by computer architecture but by network architecture this makes sense on many levels lets list them in the hope of making it easier to understand
9275350 t here will be a standardization of the hypervisor interface between the vm and the hypervisor this will allow a vm created on xen to move to vmware or hyper v and so on
9275351 while i think trans national data movement will be an area that requires governance of some kind i think that companies can get around the problem in other ways i think it just requires looking at the problem in a different way
9275352 in my experiences sic there are cases where having the data computation as close to the customer edge as possible is what is required for an acceptable user experience
9275353 even if the cloud providers come up with excellent answers to the security and reliability questions whos going to trust them
9275354 if microsoft were to buy amazon they would be in an excellent position to push the cloud computing concept even further ahead
9275355 in september of last year as i was preparing mentally and emotionally to get
9275356 a trade off to gain interoperability in exchange for stifling innovation
9275357 w e havent adequately explored the possibilities in utility computing
9275358 last year what most people meant when they talked about a standard for
9275359 initially 3teras applogic software will play a prominent role in the cloudware architecture but thats because these efforts initially need at least one vendor championing the effort

9275378 i must admit i was somewhat perplexed at why this person ever thought they would and why they were talking to me about it i explained my view but i also thought that id reiterate the same points here from the ideas of componentisation the software stack contains three main stable layers of subsystems from the application to the framework to hardware this entire software stack is shifting from a product to a service based economy due to commoditisation of it and this will eventually lead to numerous competitive utility computing markets based upon open sourced standards at the various layers of this stack these markets will depend upon substitutability which includes portability and interoperability between providers for example you might have multiple providers offering services which match the open sdk of google app engine or another market with providers matching eucalyptus what you wont get is substitutability from one layer of the stack e g the hardware level where ec2 resides to another e g the framework level where gae resides they are totally different things apples and pears
9275379 i agree with the hive that this is not an ideal outcome i wanted to find out more so checked with jeanette before i wrote anything about what had changed in negotiations and she said the greens certainly aren t keen to subsidise the fishing industry however it is the only trade exposed sector that wasn t to get any free units that means there is a process in the bill whereby business that mainly competes with overseas firms who pay no carbon price get some of their emissions covered by free units the idea is that if they dont they have a strong motivation to move overseas where there is no carbon charge with no benefit to the climate but loss of jobs in nz the reason the fishing industry didn t initially get any is that their energy source is diesel which as transport fuel doesn t generally qualify for free units because for every other industry it is used within nz and not in competition with overseas firms however for the fishing industry it is their main source of energy and they are directly exposed to competition from foreign fishers every other trade exposed industry is eligible for 90 of their 2005 emissions for free with the phase out starting only in 2019 fishing will get up to 50 and only for the first three years also peters didn t oppose the 10 or so significant improvements we got to the scheme and he asked for very little this was the main thing one can speculate as to why but it isn t unreasonable in the context of the ets as a whole it is much less than the farming sector is getting and they will still face the carbon price for half of their emissions so have an incentive to reduce carbon wherever they can so while it sticks in our throats somewhat it is short term and less than other industries are getting as it turns out peak oil could well curtail fishing companies sooner than a carbon charge would anyway all in all while were not happy with this it doesn t seem worth dying in a ditch over either

9275412 a police officer gets out of his car and starts saying hey pal hey pal
9275413 at first we didnt realize he was talking to us
9275414 at that point i thought he was going to leave us alone but he proceeded to grab my arm
9275415 and then he came after me i felt threatened and i didnt know how to react so thats when i ran
9275416 more students came after they handcuffed him and thats when the police got more violent
9275417 they grabbed me they handcuffed me and slammed my face in the road
9275418 i was yelling please let me go then they pulled out the mace
9275419 we give you a hundred breaks a year and you just piss all over us
9275420 i felt that they were specifically focusing on him targeting him as a person among many on that street

9275426 you did a good job building rapport with that client i could tell they were eager to tell you their problem
9275427 dont be too quick to jump in silences are part of the process you dont have to fill them unless things are going off track go with the flow
9275428 the client seemed to be relaxed and comfortable this initial session went really well and theyve agreed to a follow up excellent
9275429 dont be too quick to jump in and telling the client to shut up and saying you couldnt give a toss about their problem isnt appropriate
9275430 i feel angry and let down when you arrive so late because it delays the whole project and wastes everyone elses time

9275464 hes been winning a lot of tournaments its obvious when you play with him how good he is
9275465 this is the first time that ive hit the ball solidly for two days in a row in about two months so im very excited to see what ive got coming up today and tomorrow
9275466 it was a good day to make some birdies im hitting the ball really well i had a couple of squirrely shots if i can get that under control i should be ok i feel like my game is coming around so im excited
9275467 i really cant put it into words i cant explain it
9275468 when i made the walker cup as an amateur and helped the u
9275469 i was trying to think it out in my head wondering what the situation was
9275470 unfortunately up here you just have to take things as they come
9275471 is that when they called me up my job was to help out the club any way i could and this is one of those cases
9275472 when they said i was going to start i was of course excited
9275473 but when they made the change i was excited for michael and maybe i can be more beneficial to the club pitching out of the bullpen and its nice to know they think i can can into a game and eat up some innings
9275474 and you know its great that its the u s open
9275475 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9275476 at the start of the day i just wanted to make the cut to make sure i got into next weeks bmw to be honest i got off to a good start and it just snowballed from there
9275477 when i was walking up the fourth fairway i thought if i rolled in that putt i had a great chance with the way i was playing
9275478 making birdie on seven was also huge for me for a while there was certainly a chance of 59
9275479 when i was younger and maybe a rookie that might be a factor
9275480 but not now its a long week and friday was a great day im glad that it happened and it got me off to a great start but this is a new day i can honestly say i didnt think about friday at all
9275481 it felt really good because my last touchdown was on kick return and this one was on offense so it felt great
9275482 i was pretty eager i knew i could do it but i hadnt done it before and i hadnt shown anyone that i could do it i was just glad to show some of what i can do tonight
9275483 i think we exposed the running game a lot tonight
9275484 we got to the outside of them and made them think about who was going to get the ball and how they were going to contain us
9275485 i dont know if the coaches planned on it i know i didnt plan on it but im always ready thats for sure
9275486 after sitting out a whole year i was jacked up to be back on the field and being with the team again there were a lot of emotions before the game it felt like an eternity when i wasnt playing last year and it feels good to be back
9275487 obviously i blew my assignment a little bit so i knew i had to make a play or the defense had to make a play
9275488 obviously it was on my mind the whole time its my home course i live there for two years ive thought about this ive thought about it here all week
9275489 this was definitely the hardest round of my life every shot felt like q school my goal this week was to make the cut because that gives me a chance i cant believe it if i get in next week it will be the best achievement of my life
9275490 my brother is working to keep track of the standard bearers my wife is on the hospitality committee my dad is a hole marshal my father in law is a member at the club too everyone had a job for next week except me
9275491 there was no real magic i just got off to a poor start and kind of hung in there and ended up making some birdies to turn it around i had to fight back to make the cut
9275492 my goal is to be back for the first game
9275493 dan has done an excellent job running the steelers and has been a great contributor to the league
9275494 we believe he deserves the opportunity to continue so were working toward a resolution on that basis
9275495 everyone starts 0 0 we have a chance to create a new identity create the 2008 new york giants up until this point all anyone has to go on is what we accomplished last year at this time last year we were coming off an 8 8 season that a lot of people called disappointing we had a lot to prove i think in many ways this year is very similar
9275496 the no 1 thing is frustration anxiety knots in your stomach
9275497 you know all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it was presented on paper any of those types of things are very difficult for a coach no matter what age you are
9275498 clearly when the regular season starts it goes to another level
9275499 and as defending champs its a new challenge and were looking forward to it people can say whatever they want about us being defending champs that was last year our slogan this year has been that talk is cheap we have to go out and do it
9275500 we wanted to go out and execute our gameplan wasnt to go out and break any of matt ryans records that was for sure we didnt want to turn the ball over we wanted to eliminate penalties and we wanted to establish our running game
9275501 i was getting two or three yards before anyone was touching me
9275502 it wasnt the best of starts to the 2008 season
9275503 i told the defense in meetings this morning that we got enough new faces that it will be interesting to see how we react to adversity with our new core of guys
9275504 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9275505 do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9275506 im absolutely spent i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9275507 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9275508 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9275509 but its always disappointing when youre not going to win you come in to every event wanting to win thats not going to happen this week so youve got to focus on next week
9275510 theres always next week its not like the olympics we dont have to wait four years
9275511 i found out it wasnt with about 5 6 holes to go
9275512 when i got to 6 under my caddie told me you need to get to 7
9275513 i just played the same way i played all day youve just got to go for it
9275514 its a lot easier to play golf like that its easier when theres no downside to an aggressive shot
9275515 on the last it was close but i didnt hit a great putt
9275516 puede afrontar el ciclo econ mico adverso como el que vivimos

9275518 the campaign for liberty events planned for august 31 september 2 will be a celebration of our movement and our supporters a launch party for the campaign for liberty and a clear call to the republican party to return to its roots of limited government personal responsibility and protection of our natural rights the event will run in conjunction with the first two days of the republican national convention and will feature top conservative speakers musicians and organizations it will also have an organizational and training function for the campaign for liberty and the freedom movement

9275529 i havent seen it in a while but there was a time i knew every line in that movie i knew them all party on wayne excellent
9275530 i think it was inevitable i was going to walk the first guy
9275531 when i started walking in from the bullpen seeing the crowd and i actually saw a mike bowden poster
9275532 that kind of got it started but after that first batter i settled in
9275533 i thought his poise and his mound presence were outstanding
9275534 he pitched out of a couple of tight situations hes got enough on his fastball and hes got deception hes throwing out of his ear and he can get some downward angle on that fastball
9275535 we knew it was going to be a difficult opponent to come up against
9275536 but overall i think we played some good football ourselves and stuck together as a team well take the draw but we felt we deserved the win but im biased
9275537 clearly you can see the difference in that one team has been doing 6 000 miles in the past week and the other team that has been at home resting
9275538 i wish i didnt get punched in the face but its one of those you just take
9275539 we gave it enough time to see if it would click and it just didnt
9275540 i think if there is a trophy for fortitude our team would win it hands down

9275558 apabila datangnya ramadhan maka dibuka pintu pintu syurga dan ditutup pintu pintu neraka dan dirantai dibelenggu para syaitan
9275559 sesiapa yang tidak meninggalkan perkataan bohong dan perbuatan yang keji maka allah tidak ada hajat kepada makanan dan minuman yang ditinggalkannya
9275560 maka jika dikatakan bagaimana kita boleh melihat beberapa kejahatan dan maksiat berlaku dalam bulan ramadhan secara banyak jika dibelenggu para syaitan sepatutnya perkara itu tidak berlaku
9275561 sesungguhnya semua itu kurang berlaku pada orang orang yang berpuasa dengan puasa yang memelihara syarat syaratnya dan meraikan adab adabnya atau yang dimaksudkan dibelenggu sebahagian syaitan iaitulah syaitan yang degil melampau sebaliknya bukan semua syaitan seperti yang terdapat di dalam sebahagian riwayat hadith atau maksudnya mengurangkan kejahatan dalam bulan ramadhan dan ternyata berlakunya kejahatan dalam bulan ramadhan itu lebih kurang berbanding bulan yang lain demikian juga tidak semestinya dibelenggu kesemua syaitan tidak berlakunya kejahatan dan maksiat kerana ada juga sebab lain selain syaitan yang membawa kepada kejahatan seperti jiwa yang sememangnya jahat dan kebiasaan yang jelek dan syaitan manusia

9275564 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan ke atas kamu berpuasa sepertimana yang diwajibkan kepada orang orang sebelum kamu semoga kamu bertaqwa
9275565 sesungguhnya puasa yang diterima itu ialah puasa bersamanya semua anggota dari melakukan maksiat dalam keadaan perutnya dan kemaluannya berpuasa dari syahwat
9275566 puasa itu adalah perisai maka jika seseorang daripada kamu berpuasa maka janganlah dia berkata keji atau kotor dan jangan pula dia melakukan sesuatu seperti perbuatan orang yang bodoh perihal hukum agama jika seseorang mengajaknya bertengkar atau mencelanya maka hendaklah dia katanya
9275567 sesiapa yang tidak dapat perkataan dusta dan condong kepada keburukan dan suka mengerjakannya maka tidak ada bagi allah suatu hajat dari puasanya
9275568 berapa ramai yang berpuasa tidak ia perolehi dari puasanya melainkan lapar sahaja
9275569 berapa ramai yang berpuasa tidak ia perolehi dari puasanya melainkan lapar dan dahaga
9275570 bukanlah puasa itu semata mata daripada minum dan makan sahaja akan tetapi puasa dari berbohong perkara yang batil dan lagha
9275571 kalaulah al ghibah mengumpat itu membatalkan puasa tidak ada bagi kita sesuatu dari puasa
9275572 solat lima waktu jumaat ke jumaaat ramadhan ke ramadhan berperanan sebagai penghapus dosa antaranya selama mana seseorang itu menjauhi dosa dosa besar

9275665 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9275666 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9275667 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9275668 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9275669 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9275670 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9275671 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9275672 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9275673 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9275674 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9275675 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9275676 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9275677 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9275678 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9275679 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9275680 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9275681 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9275682 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9275683 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9275684 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9275685 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9275686 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9275687 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9275688 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9275689 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9275690 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9275691 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9275692 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9275693 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9275694 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9275695 scusa ma tu chi sei che occhio e croce mi pare che ci conosciamo ma sto nome non mi dice proprio nulla
9275696 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9275697 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

9275704 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9275705 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

9275753 one of the most remarkable modern day stories of revival concerns johann christoph blumhardt 1805 1880 who began pastoring a lutheran church in moetlingen germany in 1838 within a few years a young girl in his church named gottlieben dittus was diagnosed by physicians as demon possessed she had what people said was a strange nervous disorder and many psychic phenomena were taking place in her home everyone in her family and in the village seemed to knew about these things and finally one of the doctors came to blumhardt and asked him is there no pastor in this village who can pray i can do nothing here blumhardt wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with this but because of pressure from his congregation he felt compelled to pray after this doctor confronted him the resulting spiritual battle lasted two years and during this time blumhardt was neglecting his pastoral work he was becoming tense and exhausted and people began to think that he was about ready to collapse mentally and physically but then something happened unexpectedly gottliebens sister who was in the room gave a loud long cry in a strange voice jesus is victor and suddenly this girl was delivered on the very same day many people in the village reported hearing the whirring of wings and cries of despair into the abyss into the abyss woe oh woe we must go into the abyss these events transformed the whole village there was a tremendous revival in which lives were transformed broken marriages were restored enemies were reconciled and people began to experience physical healings blumhardt was more surprised by this than anyone prior to this time as a matter of course he had been laying his hands upon various members of his lutheran church for absolution but suddenly people were experiencing healings when he was doing this his preaching began to take on a new depth and people started to come from all over germany to hear him preach he had to conduct five services every sunday and his little church was filled to capacity each time with people standing outside up to a radius of up to an entire kilometer at one point the german emperor himself came to find out what was going on in this little town

9275759 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth
9275760 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above the heavens that he might fill all things eph 4 9 10
9275761 the logical explanation of these verses is that since christ ascended he must have of necessity descended at some previous period some see only the incarnation in this the early church fathers saw in it the work of christ in bringing the old testament saints out of paradise up to the throne of god although the apostles creed states that he descended into hell it means hades the place where the dead were and it is not necessary to assume that he entered into some form of suffering after his death his incarnation and death were his humiliation and descent and they were adequate to bring the redeemed of the old tstament into the presence of god i recognize however that there are other interpretations

9275839 i told my wife this is perfect weather for catching fish
9275840 the couple recently bought a place on andrusia and hendrickson says hed never fished the lake before the previous day
9275841 i basically used my thumb on the spool for tension
9275842 i just let her swim around for half an hour or so there was not much i could do
9275843 she stayed out in deeper water or i dont think we could have landed her
9275844 she jumped a total of three times and when id get her up to the boat shed shoot off those would be 20 to 30 foot power runs and then shed just stop and start swimming around again
9275845 my heart was pounding because i knew the fish was huge
9275846 ive fished heavily the majority of my life and thats a fish of a lifetime for anybody
9275847 the fishs head was bigger than mine if you look at the picture
9275848 im second guessing myself to death here who wouldnt want the notoriety of having the minnesota state record muskie but then you have to kill it
9275849 the girth can vary quite a bit this time of year
9275850 some of the fish are feeding heavily and some of the older fish are longer thinner fish anyway
9275851 ten or 15 years ago it was rare to hear about a 50 inch fish
9275852 twenty years ago we were calling a 40 inch muskie a trophy
9275853 theres so many more 50 inch fish around here now its just unbelievable
9275854 im sure ill never catch a bigger muskie the rest of my life
9275855 the only thing i wish i knew was was it a minnesota state record or not
9275856 now ive got something to wonder about the rest of my life
9275857 it is conceded by everybody that the grouse and prairie chickens were never more plentiful than they were the past two seasons and all true sportsmen together with a good many of those who at first opposed the law now are agreed that the bill cutting out the use of dogs was one of the most far sighted pieces of legislation ever passed by a north dakota legislative assembly for the conservation of game and should never be repealed if we want the growing generations to enjoy this game bird

9275907 were not only disappointed and frustrated over governments decision to turn its back on the ancestral domain deal weve completely lost trust and confidence in them the fate of the peace negotiation rests solely in the hands of the government
9275908 it was the milf that brought these changes when its forces started attacking villages killed innocent people and burned houses and farms
9275909 refocusing from one that is centred on dialogues with rebels to one of authentic dialogues with the communities with disarmament as the context of our engagements with armed groups
9275910 we might as well wait for the next president after the 2010 elections
9275911 she is just trying to save her own neck thats why she was not willing to defend the peace agreement and was also willing to sacrifice everything just to stay in power
9275912 we will continue all our efforts to reach an historic joint palestinian israeli agreement
9275913 i am not afraid but i am concerned about chaos in the nation
9275914 we cannot let the seizure of government house continue indefinitely without taking action
9275915 the phuket security must be reviewed they have been trained to handle terrorists but what happens how have they allowed these people to encroach on the runway
9275916 they have destroyed thailands image as the most attractive tourist destination
9275917 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9275918 so someone sitting in the united states you see the news and you cannot differentiate
9275919 we visit different countries we have an investment law we have the government web site and ads on arabic channels
9275920 the perception in american boardrooms is informed by the u s state department travel advisory by what is seen on tv
9275921 the kurdish government is trying a lot but some things are not in our hands
9275922 police have spoken to a person who is of interest to them and they are urging this person who knows that the police are looking for him to come forward
9275923 the girls then went back with this other man to his house overnight because it was a nice safe place for them
9275924 then they went to gisborne to report it the next morning
9275925 we always wanted to go out on a good note at home and we did that
9275926 to get this win today was very important weve got to go to parramatta next week and got to get the two points there
9275927 the core issue has been agreed upon so we are suspending the agitation for now the shrine board will exclusively use the land during the amarnath pilgrimage
9275928 el primer pleno de control de las cortes a hablar de la situaci n de la econom a espa ola

9275931 ya no es hora de hablar de talante el talante se demuestra andando
9275932 debe haber unanimidad todas las comunidades deben estar de acuerdo en la financiaci n auton mica sin que aumenten por ello los impuestos y no se quede el estado sin recursos
9275933 no estar a de m s que hubiera m s polic a local y nacional patrullando para evitar actos como stos
9275934 no se puede permitir que haya diecisiete agentes de las bescam haciendo tareas administrativas en lugar de estar en la calle velando por los ciudadanos

9275938 a los segundos del accidente se empezaron a movilizar los bomberos de barajas
9275939 manifestaciones todos los dias pidiendo la dimisi n de presidente
9275940 todos los artistas saliendo en los medios de comunicaci n dibulgando el ahorro de costes en seguridad para beneficio de el empresario
9275941 hay un proceso de radicalizaci n facistoide y delictiva hay que evaluar si no estamos pasando a un nivel superior que obligue a usar la fuerza p blica y la justicia frente a lo que ser a la gestaci n de un grupo terrorista
9275942 llamar a la guerra civil y decretar la divisi n de bolivia
9275943 no termino de comprender lo que pas en santa cruz siento verg enza de lo ocurrido son indicios serios de la presencia de terroristas

9275945 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9275946 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9275947 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9275948 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

9275957 sin que hubiese riesgo para los pacientes seg n aseguraron portavoces del complejo
9275958 that a competent patient not her doctor should decide whether to accept or reject proposed medical treatment
9275959 and with it the corollary that she must have adequate information on which to base her decision
9275960 communication is recognised as a core skill its part of being a competent doctor
9275961 they appointed me to the race relations job in the previous my friends in the national party have asked me to join them as well as a number of parties have
9275962 they factor that into the price of the plan so as they structure their plans they would look at how they got the capital cost of the phone over a certain time period
9275963 on average about 10 only of the birds dropped on the continent return to their lofts in this country it must be assumed that a great number fall into german hands
9275964 during the past few weeks i also understand there has been a great concentration on the brest and brittany areas
9275965 it might therefore be possible to deduce that we have considerable interest in this region
9275966 the pigeon is sent in a cardboard container which can quickly be buried or burnt with a little bag of corn and a questionnaire
9275967 these birds are dropped over a chosen area in the hope at least some of them will fall into the hands of supporters of the allied cause
9275968 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question asked
9275969 because pigeons are used to pass on messages its understandable someone thought of this
9275970 it must have seemed like a really good idea at the time but possibly not the next day
9275971 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9275972 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9275973 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9275974 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9275975 brother i fear my state is in another round of trouble can you imagine this man called chris uba deliberately came late for the swearing in and when he came he disorganized the whole ceremony drove straight to where the kola nuts were been broken and interrupted everything do you know it is an abomination in igbo land to interrupt the breaking of kola nut i foresee a fallout worse than that of offor mbadinuju

9275977 en tiempos de crisis puede ser un gran revulsivo para vigo
9275978 hay que adecuar la inversi n a los beneficios netos que vayan a ingresarse
9275979 habr que asegurarse el apoyo de la xunta y el estado en mayo fuimos como ciudad no como pa s si no nos respaldan es mejor no perder el tiempo
9275980 no se puede proponer una ciudad del deporte de 100 millones y llevar al jurado a visitar el pabell n de coia
9275981 al apoyo de los estamentos ciudadanos debe sumarse una fuerte y decidida apuesta de todas las administraciones al m ximo nivel lo que resulta absolutamente crucial
9275982 los ciclos malos se acaban y los proyectos a largo plazo no tienen por qu verse afectados
9275983 pero es indispensable que la xunta garantice las infraestructuras deportivas con coste cero para vigo y se redacte un proyecto econ mico serio
9275984 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9275985 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9275986 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9275987 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9275988 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9275989 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9275990 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9275991 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9275992 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9275993 before granting independence to nigeria the british government proposed that the niger delta be declared a special federal territory
9275994 the needs of those who live in the creeks and swamps of the niger delta are very different from those of the interior
9275995 a feeling of neglect and a lack of understanding was widespread a case has been made out for the special treatment of this area this is a matter that requires special effort because the area is poor backward and neglected
9275996 i dropped in on him obviously because he has been a strong and loyal supporter thats business as usual for me
9275997 of course i did in my lifetime i may have asked for money 10 000 times once in my life i ask somebody for money and they said ill give you half a million dollars what am i supposed to do say well im never going to ask him again
9275998 things were going too fast he needs time heres to the girls who couldnt cry to their friends because of how
9275999 i told you so the ones that could just tell that they had made a mistake ever
9276000 it was nice to end with three birdies as its managed to keep me in a decent position heading to the last round
9276001 gregorys played well these three days and all credit to him but there is a lot of class players behind him and he will have a lot of pressure on his shoulders
9276002 ill need to get out of the blocks quickly and post some early birdies if i am going to have a chance
9276003 the good thing is that the weather doesnt look to be too good tomorrow whilst these greens are still causing a lot of frustration for everyone
9276004 it was a very frustrating day and i have played so much better to have had seven birdies but only be two under for the day
9276005 it was a nice finish and the conditions were a lot easier as their wasnt much wind out there today
9276006 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9276007 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9276008 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9276009 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9276010 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9276011 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9276012 lies how can they say such things how can anyone sit still for this stuff
9276013 democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9276014 part of what has been lost these past eight years is our sense of common purpose
9276015 we are looking for more than just a change of party in the white house we are up against decades of bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents that kind of politics is bad for our party its bad for our country and this is our chance to end it once and for all

9276018 today we have begun a total strike in the government run health sector in the gaza strip and there is good participation with 70 percent taking part
9276019 the strikes follow calls issued by fatah run unions in ramallah
9276020 it is aimed at strengthening the blockade on hamas the palestinian government and the palestinian people
9276021 understood the motivations for it which come from the oppressive actions taken against our workers in the gaza strip
9276022 these poisonous calls come when there are more than 1 600 patients in desperate need of treatment and care
9276023 we will not let anyone mock the health security of our citizens

9276041 it makes a lot of sense to change the map of the middle east
9276042 building a democracy that is based upon the notion of the rule of the majority is a disaster for us
9276043 there is a need to establish the soil under which the seeds of liberal democratic institutions can take root
9276044 bidens views on certain regional issues such as dividing iraq along sectarian lines and his staunch support for israel have disappointed arabs
9276045 however they trust that obama is not a war president they also recognise that biden is a sharp foreign policy man
9276046 obamas choice of deputy confirms that the real change he is after is a personal one to leap from his seat in the senate to the presidential chair
9276047 biden is a firm supporter of israel but the way he sees the uss role in the middle east doesnt necessarily reflect jerusalems ideal of the ideal american partner
9276048 while lieberman is a favourite on the single issue of israel biden is more in synch with jewish voters on the broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues
9276049 attempt to place himself in the light of practical policy rather than as the brash idealist many of us came to love
9276050 because the brash idealists are never successful so id like to think that his inner idealist is driving him

9276055 a lot are resetting in the next few months which is the trigger that can cause a foreclosure

9276060 too many times people let their fire burn down until it is covered with gray ash and they leave it thinking it is out but it is not

9276064 youd be surprised how many parents drive around without their kids strapped in
9276065 the safest place for a child age 12 or under and under 59 pounds is in a properly installed age and height appropriate car seat or booster seat in the back of the vehicle
9276066 its a good idea for all families to take their cars in for a safety seat check up as well
9276067 you dont want to discover after an accident that you had your child in a seat that wasnt installed correctly
9276068 you should have a cell phone with you in your car
9276069 if youre talking on a phone while driving theres going to be cognitive impairment regardless of the kind of phone you have
9276070 if youre involved in a conversation youre not going to be able to drive a car as safely period
9276071 ive had so many near wrecks when my kids are fighting in the back seat
9276072 im trying to be a referee and a chauffeur at the same time but i know turning around to split them apart while im driving puts us all at risk on the road
9276073 if the kids are out of control get out of the traffic zone and into a safe place before trying to calm them down
9276074 and if youre on the highway never pull over on the side of the road get off on the nearest exit and get to a rest stop or parking lot to regroup
9276075 this important research illustrates the potentially dire consequences that can occur while driving distracted or drowsy
9276076 its crucial that drivers be fully alert when on the road
9276077 thankfully i woke up when my car brushed the median and i pulled over and called my best friend to come get us
9276078 but i was well aware the situation could have been much much worse or even deadly
9276079 if you still feel tired safely pull off the road and check into a motel or go to a friends house to get yourself revived whatever it takes
9276080 slow down and if necessary pull off the highway into a heavily populated area to get away from him
9276081 parents have to condition themselves not to reach for anything even if their instincts are telling them to go ahead and get it
9276082 thats a big no no because of the air bags
9276083 children riding in the front should be properly restrained and positioned 10 12 inches back from the airbag
9276084 we found enough evidence to raise concerns that parties involved may have been taking advantage of the school district
9276085 whether or not that happened is for the lawyers to work out thats why we hired a malpractice attorney
9276086 money has been taken away from our kids we demand answers
9276087 we are aggressively pursuing this matter on behalf of the kids and the taxpayers
9276088 it appears the district was sold property that was not what it was represented to be
9276089 you just dont see people on the street doing something like that everybody is trying to make money doing something
9276090 its the first time ive ever seen ice cream for free
9276091 it is sort of amusing to see how suspicious people are of free ice cream
9276092 i dont think its weird i think its awesome especially for an attorney
9276093 im setting such a bad example on so many fronts
9276094 sometimes ill give it away and sometimes ill make them pay it depends how fancy they look
9276095 the presence of arab forces on the ground can help in preventing the fighting and stopping the israeli palestinian conflict
9276096 the matter has not been studied yet but it is an attractive idea that deserves to be taken seriously when we consider that egypt and the arab league may play a role in this matter
9276097 the idea of sending an arab force to gaza is unjustified and unbalanced and it could not happen without the agreement of all palestinian factions since hamas rejects the idea it will never be implemented
9276098 im not a big fan of that kindergarten metal shit
9276099 yeah thank you for picking up on that youre one of the few journalists that has but that was one of the appealing parts of the mans character you know in metal we talk about rejection and running up against people that attack us thats exactly what that guy went through he was looked upon as a bit of a freak and he had this gift this uncanny ability to have these visions and prophecies and he was looked upon as being someone at least by the catholic church dabbling in the black arts
9276100 oh but it was a terrible time to live the 16th century to a certain extent there were still remnants of the inquisition going on which was hideous he dealt with all that and we thought man this guy led a bit of a metal life with some of those emotional elements but he stood up for himself and he was triumphant in the end and thats just a great story

9276183 theres absolutely no doubt that if the reserve bank moves that all banks should follow there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time
9276184 so over time the banks will be coming down or should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserve rate
9276185 over and above that there have been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well
9276186 that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions and other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9276187 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week therell be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates

9276253 the challenges that our country is facing today are no less overwhelming than fighting for freedom with little more than a few old rifles against the military might of a world superpower a hundred years ago the imperial might of what was spain in this century we are fighting revolution against the worst that we see in ourselves as a nation
9276254 the unifying thread in all our history from our seafaring datu forbears to our overseas filipino workers and from our fight against imperial tyranny to our fight against the tyranny of defeatist mentalities is this it is our search for the realization of our dream of an enabled empowered and ennobled existence

9276279 these banks have embarked on massive campaigns to entice clients to borrow more and more loans and thereby maximise their interests
9276280 we recognise we have a social obligation to try and ensure our customers do not borrow so excessively that they find themselves in financial difficulty it is not easy to advise customers as fully as we would wish on their aggregate debt levels from all banks as we do not have a fully operational credit bureau requiring compulsory submissions from all banks
9276281 it is disappointing to note certain banks seem to value short term revenue gains rather than ensuring a socially responsible self regulated and sustainable approach to consumer lending in circumstances where self regulation is just not working we would encourage the central bank to regulate the banks to curtail excesses particularly in lending to uae nationals
9276282 we are cognizant of the soaring inflation levels and the pressures it is putting on the residents of the uae we believe it is our responsibility to ensure our borrowing customers are not over leveraged and are able to repay the loans they take from us
9276283 a credit evaluation process is carried out prior to extending loans that involves reviewing the loan applicants bank statements to determine other obligations in order to encourage a transparent customer engagement we are shortly introducing a free 7 day lockup period for our loans if any customer is not satisfied with our loan he can return the loan to the bank there will be no penalty on the customer and all fees and charges will be refunded
9276284 more regulation is required in respect of the form and content of credit agreements this may include a requirement for the bank to notify the customer of the terms of the credit arrangement prior to entering into the agreement regulations may also specify in detail as to what the pre notification and credit agreement should disclose such as interest charges method of interest calculation related fees insurance charges etc
9276285 in addition a mandatory right to make pre payment and consequent rebate of credit charges may also be included further any change in the terms and conditions of the credit agreement should require prior notification to customers
9276286 the statistics division of the department has agreed with the commercial protection section to monitor prices weekly to protect consumers especially during ramadan
9276287 dpe teams are continuing their visits and inspections of various shopping outlets and these visits have resulted in stabilising prices of food and other consumer items for example they responded to consumers complaints about a surge in rice prices and held a series of meetings with rice suppliers and prices were lowered at some outlets
9276288 the index rose to 20 17 in the fourth week of june but declined to 19 77 in july as a result of dpe efforts it then rose by 3 5 per cent because of the increase in some seasonal products mainly fruit and vegetable as well as fish due to lower supply but the index declined again from 20 47 to 20 06 in the third week of august and by 1 19 per cent to 19 82 in the last week of august
9276289 the dpe statistics division has selected a long list of food items and set prices for them so it will closely monitor the price movement on a weekly basis during ramadan the list includes all the food needs of consumers and the index will be published on a weekly basis during ramadan
9276290 in a bid to maintain consumer awareness the dpe has launched the cpi which is a vital project that will help create a positive and competitive climate for prices in abu dhabi
9276291 since inception tecom investments has encouraged the development of knowledge sectors and its business partners through various industry clusters most of our business partners have not only grown to achieve excellence but have emerged as leaders in their respective industries
9276292 the pearl awards is a celebration of the mutual success and growth that we have achieved as a result of the relentless efforts of our business partners
9276293 the awards also aim to set new benchmarks in operational excellence within the knowledge clusters eventually contributing to the uae economy
9276294 the interest in man is the basis on which the uae renaissance has been built and this interest is not limited to the basic material needs but extends to a wider range that includes opening horizons of knowledge and means of creativity before him so as to be an effective contributor and player in finding successful solutions to the problems facing the world
9276295 a valuable addition to my library and i have the honour to add it to the national library of the hellenic republic because the book is a useful reference on sheikh mohammeds prudent vision

9276297 the bullish abu dhabi economy has attracted foreign direct investment amounting to dh7
9276298 statistics released by abu dhabi chamber of commerce and industry adcci showed

9276300 our latest two 777s are a welcome addition to the fleet it is not often an airline receives delivery of two wide bodied aircraft together worth over usus 500 million in a single day the 777s are the mainstay of our ultra long range operations allowing emirates to expand our global route network and connect dubai with non stop flights to almost anywhere in the world
9276301 i am more certain than ever that this is the direction we need to go in
9276302 banks are significantly culling their relationships but they want to maintain core clients

9276306 for me it was a relief for the season to be over

9276315 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9276316 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9276317 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9276318 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans

9276322 take another look at who they allow to perform during both ticketed and free concerts in city limits
9276323 we would prefer that they were not brought back under the towns sponsorship
9276324 it is 2008 and we are still talking about censoring artists i bet these right wing zealots have quite a porn collection stashed in their closets
9276325 i understand a free community production and family entertainment i even have a young daughter of my own but the kottonmouth kings concert had a cover charge to get in we didnt force anyone to be there
9276326 its funny how people get upset about a group like the kottonmouth kings who spread a message of peace and good vibrations yet when we were in town there was a bar on every corner and more drunk idiots roaming the streets than i can count
9276327 if its a free show out in the streets that other people are going to listen to without paying for a ticket then it has to be pg
9276328 if its a ticketed show provid ing the money isnt coming from the town of vail or from the committee for special events or something then its just a parental advisory or an explicit lyrics restriction
9276329 a band notorious for its stance on legalizing and promoting marijuana
9276330 i dont think the town wants to cast itself in the role of a music censor by any stretch of the imagination
9276331 were not trying to determine what people should and shouldnt listen to but i think we are trying to determine whats appropriate for public support and that gets a little bit dicier in terms of how its approached or looked at by the community at large
9276332 you can put this stuff in musicians contracts all day long but honestly theyre not going to care

9276335 our film bears no resemblance to the hollywood film harry potter and it is a completely different story

9276372 it was buried by governments decision not to sign the ancestral domain agreement
9276373 were not only disappointed and frustrated over governments decision to turn its back on the ancestral domain deal weve completely lost trust and confidence in them the fate of the peace negotiation rests solely in the hands of the government
9276374 it was the milf that brought these changes when its forces started attacking villages killed innocent people and burned houses and farms
9276375 refocusing from one that is centred on dialogues with rebels to one of authentic dialogues with the communities with disarmament as the context of our engagements with armed groups
9276376 we might as well wait for the next president after the 2010 elections
9276377 she is just trying to save her own neck thats why she was not willing to defend the peace agreement and was also willing to sacrifice everything just to stay in power
9276378 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time

9276454 the story songs came out of conversations between pierre kaiser the dimes lead guitarist moog master and backing vocalist and i we work the same day job and usually eat lunch together i used to write boy girl songs like most pop writers but at lunch im always talking about stories i read in the newspapers pierre said why dont you write story songs theyd be better than the crap youve been bringing me lately i was already working on catch me jumping which is a true story about a friend who joined the navy he was out at sea and ended up jumping off the ship i think as a cry for help wed just been in japan playing shows on us bases including the one he was stationed to he was on a tight leash and had to check in with the guards before he could make any move it was a real story and the other guys in the band had such a positive reaction to it it got me addicted to the idea of story songs it was a combination of pierre telling me to get off my ass and stop trying to fit into some mold and my realization after writing catch me jumping that it could be a great thing i started working on the battle of san jacinto which i grew up hearing about in school in san antone i did some research and found out what both sides were experiencing and it was my first history song when i saw how much fun it was to write and how rewarding it was story songs became the story of the band for the next year and a half
9276455 pierre has an old house hes renovating which made it a perfect studio
9276456 he had isolated all the instruments in empty rooms and set up a studio in the basement we were going over for an all weekend session and when we showed up pierre had a stack of tattered newspapers on the kitchen table hed torn up the kitchen floor and under the floor someone had used these newspapers for insulation they were laid flat and in good shape we must have read then for an hour and the page he handed me was a world news page from the long gone oregonian daily journal it had headlines like reds riot in new york and man awake for 15 years cant pay his club bill and emmy destin dies in czechoslovakia i couldnt stop reading the man awake story was about captain paul kern who was shot in the head in wwi they saved his life but the bullet hit the part of his brain that controls sleep and fatigue he never slept again for the rest of his life he hung out at a club to find people to talk to at three in the morning i started singing paul kern cant sleep i stayed up all night and wrote paul kern i showed up for rehearsal the next day and played it and we all got excited we spent the day jamming on it and the parts came together i got three songs from that one page of newsprint we would have had fun making whatever album we would have made but after those newspapers it veered from one history song to three then seven more
9276457 we recorded and produced ourselves in our various bedrooms basements and attics using pro tools
9276458 but theres such a thing as being too perfect if we dont nail it in one take it goes out and we do it again i cant stand pitch correction i think relying on it is abusing the technology we usually play live over an acoustic guitar and vocal demo that i lay down with a click track so we get that live feel if you know what youre going for you can capture the raw element without sounding too digital
9276459 to follow a girl the age old story but were now married so it was a good move
9276460 i responded to an ad looking for a john lennon for a beatles tribute band and got the job but the band only lasted three gigs at the second gig i met pierre who invited me over to his house to jam with his roommate jake rahner who played drums we started getting together weekly after writing a few songs we put an ad for a bass player on craigs list and a few other sites and ryan showed up after we played one song with him we asked him to join
9276461 were aiming to have the next group of songs ready by early 09 when pierre told me he grew up in boston i started to research the city as if i were going on a trip boston was the center of early american history so i finished a boston song i had so much fun finding out about that history i thought maybe we should have a couple of boston tunes i wrote about the ride of paul revere in the first person and now i have 18 songs about people from boston or events that happened there clara barton who started the american red cross was from boston the sacco venzetti trial took place in boston and led to the riot i wrote about in new york 1930 the presiding judge in the case webster thayer had made up his mind before the trail that they were gonna fry and told his friends at his country club he was gonna throw the book at them they lost the trial and appealed but he was the appellate judge and denied their appeal five times which caused riots all over the world london new york moscow the chicago 1929 song was about the great chicago fire which was the biggest in american history but a year later in 1872 we had the great boston fire i wasnt planning to tie the new songs to the first record but i found all these connections when i started to investigate the history of boston its amazing how the threads of our history are so intertwined

9276467 providing this information would be a first step towards accountability for the uks involvement in the us programme of rendition and secret detention and in the torture and other ill treatment of terrorist suspects
9276468 statements that binyam mohamed made in the course of his unlawful detention will form the basis of charges against him if he is tried before a military commission at guant namo bay a trial which would be unfair and could involve charges which could be punishable by death any information which the uk authorities have which relates to violations of his human rights or could help binyam mohameds defence should be disclosed to his lawyers without any further delay

9276516 going surfing is a big part of my creative process
9276517 surfing has always been a big part of my life ive surfed since i was nine years old leaving land is my favorite part of it i like being in a separate reality
9276518 its still my favorite thing to listen to a story through a song its like nothing else a song can preserve time and memory and history in a way that words or a picture alone cant a song can capture it all
9276519 it was a great time and a life changing time for me i felt like i had a peer group not only did i identify as far as politics and music but also age wise i had been with people because they were lesbian and women and we had a lot in common but they were all a lot older so for once i fit in where could a freak fit in in punk rock
9276520 so i came back from san francisco and the only people i knew here were lesbians and no way man i wanted punk rock i started going out to punk shows i would put on a little suit and tie and i would go there and try to look so cool though i didnt know a soul
9276521 he walks up to me and says hey want to be in a band
9276522 the fashions changed and the politics changed and people were wearing the swastika which they hadnt been up to that time because im jewish i would notice and it pissed me off so i wrote a song called take off your swastika it was right around the same time the dead kennedys wrote nazi punks fuck off i wrote the song as a direct personal reaction to the swastikas and i decided to play it on my acoustic guitar up til then id been playing electric guitar and synthesizer nobody in punk was really playing acoustic guitar at that time and the reason i did it was because i really wanted the words to be heard because as far as im concerned punk rock is the folk music of today though i didnt play it at some folk club i played it at punk rock clubs
9276523 people would yell and id get heckled and stuff but on the whole it was pretty great i remember playing at the whisky and seeing a couple of guys taking off their swastikas

9276538 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word

9276588 i am the bearer of truth light being incarnate pillar of consciousness the mouthpiece of the almighty though not the word of god nor god in veritas more than you one whose existence has become overtaken by the word when you have heard or read of the word of god it has come through this mouth though not my mouth in this life i am a stream of knowledge and a herald of a new age the rule of which will be love i am born of many lives ancient i am ecstacy self actualized and of no self present to speak but anonymous
9276589 not in number no though the word is singular it is not however incorrupt in this realm for the very first words of your scripture are inexact the text should read to begin with you see dont you in the beginning is perfectly lovely but it was just another way of people trying to take the plain facts and dress them up but in this instance they dressed it wrong in the beginning places an undue stress on temporal whereas the eternal has no beginning instead the text should simply acknowledge that this a way of starting the story it may be i admit the beginning of things but it is not at all the beginning
9276590 as we know and i can now tell you freely without having to look over our shoulders for any of those nasty witch hunters the hydrogen atom is dual in nature representative of the very nature of our races perception

9276606 salvation is not a detached gift of god in some gracious and miraculous way bestowed upon man salvation is christ and to experience salvation is to experience christ it is not the experience of something but of someone the bible does not teach that christ has salvation and dispenses it like a benevolent master giving gifts to his servants who obey him christ is our salvation and gives himself to us as our salvation he is our life he is our strength he is our peace he is our joy he is our wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption

9276665 een meisje van veertien vroeg om een neuscorrectie ze was heel onzeker geworden over haar uiterlijk nadat ze uit drie scholen was weggepest
9276666 het corrigeren van flaporen bij kinderen van zes zeven jaar is het bekendste voorbeeld in die leeftijd worden kinderen immers bewust van hun uiterlijk het is dan dat pestgedrag ontstaat
9276667 in de puberteit komt daar nog bij dat de jongeren plots heel erg groeien het komt inderdaad vaak voor dat jongeren dan een negatief zelfbeeld ontwikkelen omdat hun neus plots heel groot is hun kin te lang of hun borsten klein als het hen kan helpen zich te ontwikkelen zonder complexen kan plastische chirurgie een goede zaak zijn

9276709 kalau golkar di zamam pak harto orde baru tentu kuat tapi di era sekarang partai golkar kedudukannya sama dengan partai lain sehingga salah kalau dikatakan golkar posisinya menjadi sulit karena mendukung pemerintah keliru itu demokrat saja kursinya di kabinet hanya dapat 2 dan tidak punya komisaris di bumn golkar malah banyak
9276710 kemajuan salah satu partai politik saat ini bukan karena mengandalkan pemerintah atau tidak akan tetapi bagaimana menerapkan program merebut simpati publik kalau kemudian golkar menyalahkan pemerintah itu salah golkar itu salah menentukan konsepnya sendiri pak sby itu sangat netral termasuk terhadap partai demokrat
9276711 posisi politik golkar di pemerintahan menjadi unik dan tidak dominan karena kalla menjadi pimpinan golkar setelah dia menjabat wapres sehingga golkar tidak dianggap sebagai pendukung pasangan presiden dan wapres
9276712 begitu juga dengan pks kalau pks bisa dapat 20 persen bisa saja pak sby disandingkan dengan pak hidayat nurwahid kalau tidak ya tidak akan mungkin namun meski pdip kemungkinan suaranya besar demokrat tidak akan menggandengnya karena berbeda paradigma kecuali kalau pranomo anung mau bersanding dengan pak sby

9276758 activision was legendary for making the vcs do what seemed previously impossible how was it working for activision were you a former atari employee like some of your coworkers if so what was your experience at atari why did you leave activision why did you leave the game industry what game that you worked on was your favorite mine are definitely kabobber pitfall ii and system shock what was your involvement in pitfall ii and system shock would you like to see a system shock 3 how did you feel about bioshock what did you think of the later pitfall games
9276759 kabobber is a unique game and i feel it could have been a big hit especially in the arcades what inspired kabobber and did you ever consider an arcade version or sequel why was kabobber never finished were you the one who released it to the public in 2000 were you the one to finish the prototype if not do you approve of the finished version
9276760 i dont know how i came up with kabobber exactly
9276761 atariage com held a contest to write a manual and storyline for the game how accurate do you feel the manual is and does the storyline have your blessing or did you have something else in mind at the time
9276762 can you send me a link if ive seen this and i might have ive forgotten i certainly didnt write the storyline
9276763 the various names i used to describe the games entities buvskies for the players critters kabobbers for the main enemies cholos for the nastier red enemies were all at one time various nicknames for my dog jake the boots didnt fit this scheme oh well the game description you pointed me to is generally correct though the game received no extra work before being put online
9276764 was there anything else you or your colleagues worked on that was never released if so does code still exist
9276765 there were many games done at parker and activision that never saw the light of day though many have since been put onto the internet
9276766 is there anything else you can think of that might interest fans of all things retro games or otherwise what are you up to these days hows your family are you still working what are your favorite hobbies
9276767 i found the atari 2600 a lot of fun to program because it was such a small contained system which you really had to be creative to get to do anything at all as you may know if you dont reprogram graphic registers as the tv gun is scanning down the screen all you get is vertical stripes im proud to hold the record of 13 sprites on a line via on the fly reprogramming of sprite replication registers as the gun goes horizontally across the screen this is in kabobber the baby kabobber strip at the bottom alan miller had gotten 12 in robotank i believe my favorite games on that system were accolades stampede tennis ice hockey pitfall ii starting around 1990 a single programmer couldnt work on a first class game anymore i worked on a lot of team projects and they of course are fun too but i always found managing teams to be 30 fun and 70 headache others mileage may differ my last game employment was at mad doc software as lead programmer for an empire earth expansion pack and then empire earth ii i like real time strategy games and these were fun projects subject to my earlier caveat as you may know im one of the people who fell down the rabbit hole of the 1960s assassinations and in 1999 or 2000 i began scanning and putting online declassified govt records at my website www history matters com a few years ago i joined up with a non profit foundation and we have expanded this effort at www maryferrell org ive considered doing game work again possibly on the smaller scale afforded by web games or cell phones but for now i have too many projects in the queue so if it happens it will have to wait a bit thanks for your interest

9276795 in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints there is no paid ministry no professional clergy as is common in other churches more significant even than this is that there is no laity no lay membership as such men are eligible to hold the priesthood and to carry on the ministry of the church and both men and women serve in many auxiliary capacities this responsibility comes to men whether they are rich or poor and with this responsibility also comes the authority there are many who would deny and others who would disregard it nevertheless the measure of that authority does not depend on whether men sustain that authority but rather depends on whether god will recognize and honor that authority

9276875 susan youve had nine long years with john try to hang on to that
9276876 oh myra just thirty minutes ago i was planning a trip to the cabin i sit here not knowing what i feel the detective said john was in the hallway waiting for the bellhop to take his luggage down to the lobby then all of sudden a woman in her early thirties ran up screaming and yelling she pulled out a gun and shot him in the head they tried to stop her but she got away in the confusion detective steel said john didnt feel any pain he died instantly
9276877 myra said in a persuasive manner as she let out a deep breath and clasped a hand over susans arm

9276879 im sorry mrs morgan hold on a moment ill connect you to the coroners office
9276880 susan wrote the numbers quickly she hung up and moved over to the french door everything looks the same yet john is dead after a few minutes she turned and walked into the bathroom she splashed water on her face and slowly wiped it with a fresh towel looking in the mirror there was an unrecognizable womans reflection who was staring back at her she was worn wide eyes hollow she turned away leaving the bathroom feeling sick to her stomach she bent down and steadied herself by grabbing onto the bedpost and tightened her grip with her eyes closed she moaned why cant i cry john is dead john is dead she felt like a defeated animal shot with a stun gun her emotions were veiled somewhere off deep inside of her she clung tighter to the bedpost as if to think it might lesson her sickness then she let go she looked out the window and saw birds flying perhaps heading toward a nest in the tall trees she wondered if they were flying to feed their babies she had no babies she was alone reaching over to snatch the pink silk blouse uneasiness came over her and she gripped it tightly to her chest thinking about the first time she saw john susan cunningham a struggling suburban girl from torrance california she had met john while working at a small local caf to pay for her education she had seen him sitting over near the window that first day he was trim and handsome in his three piece suit he looked at her with his dark brown eyes and smiled she blushed and smiled back he came in every morning after that sometimes they talked and laughed about different topics then one day he invited her to a company party john stood about 511

9276981 you were out there for almost a half hour its a wonder you dont have hypothermia or any broken bones for that matter
9276982 i know you want to get out of here so ill make this as quick as possible
9276983 im going to need a description of the assailant what he looked like what he was wearing anything you think might help
9276984 i couldnt make out his face he was wearing a hood and it was dark i think he was white though i could kind of see his hair underneath the hood it was either black or brown i couldnt tell and he was as tall as greg about five ten maybe six feet
9276985 he was in a hooded black jacket and jeans the jeans had holes in the knees
9276986 well its not much but at least we have a good idea of where to start well keep our eyes open for anyone who comes in matching the description if we come up with anything well give you a call
9276987 excuse me sir i need to speak with you for a moment
9276988 weve been receiving a number of complaints from business owners in the area
9276989 sir im going to have to ask you to submit to a sobriety test
9276990 alright buddy you are under arrest for public intoxication you have the right to remain silent anything you say
9276991 i paid a few thousand dollars just to be here to listen to this lecture id really like to hear what the man is saying
9276992 you know i could always just let you sit in the chair
9276993 what and make me the guy who wouldnt let his girlfriend have the only chair oh no no no no no chivalry and all that
9276994 well i can be chivalrous too if i want to
9276995 not around me you wont im too old fashioned all you young people scare the bejeezus out of me with your rock music and your cellular telephones and your inter web
9276996 sorry about this wait we had to get all our guys up from the lock up it always takes forever
9276997 we picked up a few people recently that match your description
9276998 wed like you to take a look at a few of them theyll come in read the line weve given to them and if any of them are your guy you point him out if not you go home simple as that
9276999 isnt this a lot of trouble to go through to catch a mugger
9277000 some of these guys are multiple offenders and for worse things than assault with enough offenses on his record sometimes even a simple mugging is enough to put a real dirtbag away for good
9277001 but but theres more to it than that right body language general build
9277002 those are hardly conclusive foundations for a testamony mr pollux i understand that you want to find this guy but until we can be sure
9277003 i am sure i am telling you right now its number four
9277004 its number four hes wearing the exact same clothes as the man who mugged us
9277005 number four jason castor i take it that you dont need to hear him read the card
9277006 jimmy its jason what the hell took you so long yeah yeah im in lock up look its its a long story hah yeah youd know all about that listen i yeah im calling about that favor you owe me man
9277007 what do you mean you had to let him go
9277008 i mean i had to let him go the guy had an alibi
9277009 but i know he did it sergeant im telling you it was him
9277010 and im telling you it wasnt the guy could account for exactly where he was on the night of the mugging in a bar getting plastered with his buddies til closing time
9277011 we have nine other testimonies from people that were there with him that corroborate with his story we had nothing on him
9277012 what so he gets a bunch of his friends to say he was with them and he just gets off scott free
9277013 we have no evidence that this man had anything to do with your mugging he didnt have a knife he didnt have your wallet there are probably a hundred people in this city with a jacket like his and we have on record that you never saw your assailants face now i understand that you have undergone a traumatic experience that you want to find the man who attacked you and your girlfriend and i understand that you are convinced that youve found him but this is a police investigation and it must rely solely on provable facts and as well as this investigation can determine the man you are looking for is not this man
9277014 take my advice kid just put this whole thing behind you whether we find the guy or not its our job our responsibility to bring him in just leave this to the professionals and try not to worry about it anymore
9277015 yeah yeah youre probably right ive just been under a lot of stress i guess
9277016 it happens to everybody sometime now if youll excuse me i have to get back to work if anything else comes up ill let you know
9277017 and the kid picks it up and just hands it right back to him
9277018 good better drink up buddy while its still on the house
9277019 hey i heard about what happened with the cops dumb fuckin luck right somebody make you their bitch before you made bail
9277020 heh nah i made it just in time its good to be out of that hole yknow
9277021 well try not to get yourself in there next time you dopey fuck
9277022 you outta be glad youve got friends like these guys around to keep you outta trouble
9277023 well then you came to the right place what sort of gun are you looking for
9277024 alright handgun it is are you planning on using this for hunting or home defense
9277025 okay then ive think ive got just what you want
9277026 one hundred sixty one for the gun ammo is fourteen ninety nine per box
9277027 its one of the best of the smaller models its high enough caliber to put down an intruder quickly and its easy to aim accurately low recoil so youre less likely to miss
9277028 okay sir thats one 38 special with a box of ammo one safety lock
9277029 actually sir its pennsylvania state law that all handguns must be sold with an accompanying safety lock you cant buy a firearm without one
9277030 okay thats the wesson the bullets and the lock and your total will be one ninety five thirty seven

9277042 ive got a really good group of buddies and we train either early in the morning or late at night so we can still make things like the kids basketball games and try not to impact the family life
9277043 i have to trust my life in his hands and i do because he can still think when hes dehydrated and tired
9277044 you know i think this is the longest ive been partners with anybody a lot of teams certainly dont have fun when theyre doing it and i like to think todd and i do

9277146 i couldnt pick her out of a lineup of people
9277147 i have never met this woman but apparently the anti fluoride group seems to have a large pocket in our district and apparently i didnt realize how large it was
9277148 that battle was fought before i got on the board and i wasnt part of that debate
9277149 i am certainly not interested in revisiting that issue i have grandchildren and i want them to have healthy teeth
9277150 i think a lot of people are becoming more and more aware of the fluoride issue just as i have become more recently
9277151 i know mr fink kind of brushed that issue off as not being an important issue maybe he might rethink that
9277152 we looked at candidates and noticed there werent a lot of them who were against fluoridation in the water
9277153 shes avidly against fluoride we were behind her the whole way
9277154 that is the seeds from these plants would themselves grow the same kind of plant heres most of our midrash
9277155 the glory of the lords endures forever the lord rightly rejoices in his works
9277156 this implies that the taste of the tree should be the same as the taste of the fruit however it the earth did not do this but rather the earth sprouted forth a tree producing a fruit but the tree itself was not a fruit
9277157 therefore when adam was cursed for his sin it the earth too was punished for its sin and was also cursed
9277158 snooping on your neighbours to report recycling infringements sounds like something straight out of the east german stasis copybook
9277159 with council tax so high the last thing people want to pay for is an army of busybodies peering through their net curtains at their neighbours as they put out their rubbish
9277160 volunteers will be involved in reporting issues in their area such as recycling waste fly tipping graffiti dog fouling and abandoned vehicles
9277161 these are all people who care about the environment and they will be ambassadors for their area
9277162 they will be there to report graffiti abandoned vehicles and local vandalism but not to report on other individuals
9277163 and they might go to an over 60s club and talk about recycling
9277164 environment volunteers care passionately about their area and want to protect it
9277165 they are not snoopers they will help councils cut crime and make places cleaner greener and safer
9277166 oh my g d i should have gotten both vampire books
9277167 well i mean you know they need blood to survive blood is life and they like cant have any if theyre jewish
9277168 people of european heritage dont get asked what are you doing here
9277169 only jews of color or perceived to be of color are asked those questions
9277170 how did you get here the last time i remember being here was with adric
9277171 gonna take care of that soons i leave which wont be long i know as well as you do what the consequences of us meeting up could be but before i go ive got to give you something
9277172 mind you its something ive misplaced myself a few times but im not sure any of that was my fault
9277173 i left rose my rose in london with her mum and came back to do some repair work when suddenly the tardis picked up a beacon not any old beacon mind you one specifically tuned to the tardiss systems i followed it of course and i ended up in a bazaar on nepthron ii when i finally tracked the beacon down i found an awfully familiar face who seemed a little shocked to see me instead of a skinny boy in a brown suit so i offered to bring her to you
9277174 took a long time and didnt quite work the way id planned nor did the beacon in my mobile but its got me here at last
9277175 if i mean if you still want me to come with you
9277176 just got to hide this memory away somewhere safe and then get back to london before my rose knows ive gone missing dont mind me just carry on with what youre doing
9277177 he said hed hide the memory out in plain sight for you not for him that is somewhere youd be sure to find it
9277178 but we didnt i mean you never seemed to want to

9277204 addictive like a slot machine you keep hitting next to see another screen of profiles thinking youre gonna get lucky sevens
9277205 variable payout schedule which is used in slot machine designs is the most addictive form of psychological conditioning because you never know when youll get paid it could be every 10 times you play or every hundred
9277206 every time you log on you never know what youll find thats why it expands to fill a persons time last night was a bust but who knows who will be online this morning or tonight

9277208 if youre good enough for adonai the lord then youre definitely good enough for everyone else if people dont like the way you are then they can kiss your tuches
9277209 im surprised because i thought that america was a secular integrated country just like israel why is your particular clientele so religious and racially segregated
9277210 i can explain miss sarah but first of all i have to tell you about black church thats what darren calls the church that afro americans attend while americans work and play together they dont worship and pray together black church has always been livelier than white church frankly white folks just dont seem to be having fun in their churches so we like to have our church the way we like it i know that i dont look much like it but i used to be a southern baptist minister one day the faithful in my congregation asked me to lead them on a tour of the holy land the trip was so successful that the pentecostals and then the seventh day adventists wanted a tour as well i got a reputation for my tours in all the black churches throughout georgia i had almost no time for the preaching i was making more money with the holy land tour business than i was making as a preacher
9277211 darren would you like to see how israelis have fun maybe your clientele would like this kind of show when they visit eilat
9277212 man i havent worked up a sweat like that since my college days when i played football for georgia baptist college
9277213 you played football ive never seen a football player as big as you are here in israel the football players are all little men not big like you
9277214 youre thinking of soccer miss sarah i played american football soccer is played with a round ball by skinny guys but american football is played by big guys with a long skinny ball linemen like me are the biggest toughest men in american football we have to be big and tough to protect the skinny pretty boys who play in the backfield i should have let a few linebackers through to sack the pretty boys for keeping all the women to themselves nah revenge wouldnt be christian and besides i wanted to play in the nfl i never got to the nfl though being a christian i wouldnt take any drugs to play better im not barry bonds well i graduated i got me a good church and i made myself a success both as a preacher and now as a travel agent
9277215 let me guess you became a travel agent instead of a komer because you made more money in the travel business
9277216 no miss sarah i had another reason for leaving the ministry i left because an elders wife came to me for marriage counseling
9277217 i dont understand isnt that just part of a komers job to provide counseling services even our modern rabbis study psychology along side the talmud
9277218 probably your rabbis dont get quite as involved in their work as i did after a few sessions of talking to the woman and praying with her it turned out that the problem in her marriage was that the elder was denying himself to her that elders wife was just plain sexually frustrated you can look it up in the bible but its un christian for a man to deny his wife sex so i ummh did the righteous thing for her and relieved her frustration right there on the desk in my vestry i grabbed her by the hips and ground on her pussy until there was smoke between her thighs she got up from my desk so happy that i saved her marriage she told all the frustrated women in my congregation that i had to be the worlds greatest marriage counselor she was very discreet but her story spread wider than she spread her legs on my desk suddenly i had half the women in the congregation asking me for counseling yes things were going well in my ministry my real problems began when my fame spread and women from the other black churches in town started attending my church i never knew that there were so many unhappy marriages in our community that needed saving now i wasnt just humping the women in my congregation i was stealing women members of the other preachers flocks so before i got hauled up before the georgia ministerial council i left the preaching for the tourist industry since i was making more money arranging holy land tours than i made in the church i quit as a preacher yet the requests for my brand of marriage counseling didnt quit when i quit the pulpit you have no idea how many god fearing church women need sound biblical advice on the subject of marriage and marital salvation my advice invariably was that they should take one of my tours of the holy land without their husbands invariably i always returned happy women to their husbands do you know that this is the first trip ive made to israel where i havent counseled churchwomen by giving what they werent getting from their husbands
9277219 i assume that all those women in the churches were black women darren uh have you ever been with a white woman
9277220 ive never had any good experiences with white women until i met you i thought white women were mostly bitches for example when i played college football those skinny white cheerleaders were interested in us black guys but only the quarterbacks and wide receivers as i said a lineman has to have some weight to protect the pretty quarterbacks ass excuse me tush as you can see im short and stocky skinny girls dont go for guys like me
9277221 darren thats exactly how i get treated by men they dont like big women like me what i dont understand is why you had so much success with all your church ladies why didnt they treat you the same way the cheerleaders did
9277222 its like this miss sarah black folks are different from white folks in more ways than the colour of our skin weve got ourselves a completely different culture you can easily see it in our music or like i say in our churches we also have different values when it comes to our bodies in black society we value size and strength even in our women its a good thing to be thick in your body
9277223 i think im beginning to like you black people more and more as an afro american do you like my looks and my body type
9277224 do i like how you look miss sarah i think youre one phat woman
9277225 you must think i said that youre fat f a t i didnt mean f a t at all miss sarah phat p h a t is an acronym in ebonics that black men use to describe a beautiful woman its an acronym for perfect hips ass and tits im sorry you misunderstood
9277226 the break has probably come at a good time for us
9277227 its a good chance for us to reflect on things and to turn our attention back to what we were doing before in the 2008 pre season cup competition
9277228 it was really disappointing we were absolutely not at the level we needed to be and we need to take a long hard look at ourselves right across the board we were flat throughout and no one made a contribution from a 60 70 or 80 minute point of view
9277229 quite simply we need to accept the reality that we werent up to scratch it wasnt good enough and we need to be better
9277230 weve got to knuckle back down and keep working on it
9277231 weve gone away from what we were doing well working hard and working together

9277243 when we talk about tourism and people coming over to visit los angeles theyre not going to see the nasty parts
9277244 similar units in our last building are renting for 900 per month so it makes a lot of sense to own rather than rent
9277245 i wonder if pointing out their improper apostrophe usage would yield further incentives
9277246 well its still better than renting if you buy right now instead of renting for the next five years its more likely that youll be better off are there other better deal available
9277247 we certainly had a great race car tonight it was phenomenal

9277258 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
9277259 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9277260 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9277261 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
9277262 gabriel and i have always remained that we would never sell baby photos or otherwise exploit her in any way i will do everything i can for the sake of her safety and well being to keep her out of the public eye
9277263 so did i really just sleep with my second grade teacher
9277264 ashlee broke down in tears at a doctors appointment in early august when she found out shes gained more weight than is considered in the healthy range

9277266 i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun
9277267 hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with
9277268 my mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice
9277269 but its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
9277270 i dont think its something well decide until the baby comes
9277271 we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9277272 what do you think i work out to every day i know the whole thing by heart
9277273 its about how i feel about spencer and my relationship
9277274 theyre trying to keep it quiet because they dont want to jinx the whole thing
9277275 i can understand why people go outside the u s you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying
9277276 can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9277277 ive always wanted to have babies and adopt when i was little i remember seeing tv shows and a child would be adopted and be happy i just always felt like there are so many kids out there who need a parent

9277280 they are saying if you dont stop meddling in our sphere of influence this is what we are going to do
9277281 back georgia and ukraine for nato membership and youll see the s 300 to iran it is a very powerful bargaining chip and a major deterrent to us actions in the region moscow is playing very strategically on americas obsession with iran
9277282 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9277283 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9277284 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9277285 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful

9277305 national security intelligence organizations should monitor advances in cognitive neuroscience research

9277310 project mkultra the cias program of research in behavioral modification
9277311 at all social levels high and low native americans and foreign
9277312 if behavioral psychology was handmaid to the horrors perpetrated at guant namo bay abu ghraib and cia transnational black sites what new nightmares are in store for humanity when advances in neuroscience complex computer algorithms and a secretive national security state enter stage far right
9277313 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
9277314 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
9277315 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
9277316 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
9277317 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
9277318 this kind of stuff is very important folks we need to become as informed about mind control projects as we are about 911 truth why because if they can manipulate your moods with rf frequencies then we could have already be suppressed heavily through its means right now
9277319 its a revolution of the mind of how people think and how machines can help people work better
9277320 there are numerous positive impacts cognitive systems technologies can have on our national security
9277321 we are engaged in a human war that is influenced primarily by individual human beings rather than technology or bureaucracy
9277322 the plan is at the level of send a man to the moon beyond the scope of what any one institution can possibly do
9277323 its a synthesis of ideas now our intent is to home in on a few areas in which the labs can make a unique and profound contribution
9277324 what makes most sense is for sandia to select areas where we have unique collective technical strengths areas that few others in the world can do as well
9277325 these include such capabilities as high performance computing nanotech physics based modeling and simulation and surety
9277326 cs amp ts ambitious direction may not be realized for many decades but the information required for progress is emerging today
9277327 it is reasonable to expect future discoveries will become the nobel class achievements for the cognitive and neuroscience communities at large in the years to come
9277328 cognitive systems consist of technologies that utilize as an essential component one or more computational models of human cognitive processes or the knowledge of specific experts users or other individuals
9277329 once that happens the best of both worlds can happen
9277330 if we understand human cognition better we can work together as a nation to reduce tension find problems before they turn into armed conflict and to work toward actions that establish and maintain peace worldwide

9277334 i think people tend to have comments about how much affection people hold the hacks in
9277335 certainly never my intention not to display any hacks people do think that they really have a big part to play with the museum
9277336 the general public has the most questions about the exhibit because its very inside
9277337 i think its really great that these are preserved i like the schools attitude about hacks its a really important part of the schools culture

9277342 the cayman trough may be a lost world that will give us the missing piece in a global puzzle of deep sea life

9277347 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
9277348 the militant muslim is the person cutting the head of the infidel while the moderate muslim holds the victims feet
9277349 the law which their prophet mohamed has given to muslims is that any harm done to any one who does not accept their law and any appropriation of his goods is no sin at all
9277350 the essence of mohammeds doctrine was violence and lust to exalt the brutal over the spiritual part of human nature
9277351 over a billion people believe in allah without truly knowing what allah supposedly stands for or what he really demands of them and the minority that do understand continue to be moslems because they have redefined their morality and ethics to fit within the teachings of islam which are floridly lacking in morality they therefore redefine what is good and evil in order to fit their lives into what is preached by islam instead of examining islam to see if it fits within the good life backwards thinking imposed by a backward religion
9277352 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men
9277353 i studied the kuran a great deal i came away from that study with the conviction that by and large there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of muhammed
9277354 muslims are the first victims of islam many times i have observed in my travels that fanaticism comes from a small number of dangerous men who maintain others in the practice of this religion by terror to liberate the muslim from his religion is the best service that one can render him
9277355 the islamic conquest of india is probably the bloodiest story in history it is a discouraging tale for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good whose delicate complex of order and freedom culture and peace can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within
9277356 the muslim conquests down to the 16th century were for the hindus a pure struggle of life and death
9277357 show me just what prophet muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
9277358 islamic societies are suffocated by shackles around the human spirit and brain islamic theology is driven by machoism dominance intolerance submission and violence to all that disagrees with islams principles of law
9277359 the most successful lecherous man who used religion for his personal gain is prophet mohammed islam is a cult with its complete irrational belief in allah created by muhammed who was a liar thief murderer and rapist till his last breath
9277360 for good people to do evil things that takes religion religion is an insult to human dignity

9277364 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this

9277372 it is true to say we reserved all our rights legally and while no final decisions have been taken we would clearly have acted in what we thought were in the best interests of the mastheads and of the business as the situation evolved
9277373 all four of those meetings have voted overwhelming to accept the proposed eba and that will need to be formalised by a full vote of members during the week

9277376 providing australians stay away from demonstrations our assessment at this stage is that there is no direct or immediate threat to them

9277426 it is on earth that he expects to get glory from us glory such as angels cannot give glory such as we shall not be able to give hereafter it is here that we are to preach to angels it is here we are to show to them what a glorious god is ours our whole life below is given us for this but it is especially in sorrow and under infirmity that god looks for glory from us what a god honouring thing to see a struggling sorrowing child of earth cleave fast to god calmly trusting in him happy and at rest in the midst of storm and suffering what a spectacle for the hosts of heaven now then is the time for the saints to give glory to the lord their god let them prize affliction as the very time and opportunity for doing so most of all let them use such a season well and oh what consolation to think that affliction is really such a season ah surely it is one which an angel might covet which an archangel would gladly stoop to were that possible they can glorify god much in heaven amid its glory and blessedness but oh not half so much as we can on earth amid suffering and shame

9277494 theres no doubt in my mind that the first batch we found was deliberately set and the batch we found today seems to be similar to whats washing up in ocean city and in one to two other towns
9277495 this material is waterlogged and looks like it has been in the water for quite a while
9277496 its a shame its a real shame for the town especially on a holiday weekend
9277497 were just glad it didnt happen on memorial day weekend because that could taint the entire season
9277498 something like this happening early in the season might make some people think twice about coming here
9277499 but i think by now the people who live here or have summer homes here are so loyal to the town they realize that what happened isnt the fault of anything the town has done
9277500 im more concerned about the safety of the people on the beach than whether or not theyll come down and shop in my store
9277501 i think thats the attitude of pretty much everyone here and i think thats why people are so loyal to avalon
9277502 its not the best of times but i dont think it colors the image of the town because i think people realize this is an isolated problem and not the kind of thing that was going with the ocean dumping in the 1980s

9277552 our daughter is looking at smith college she wants to go into engineering these schools are 35 000 to 40 000 a year
9277553 we werent getting raises where i work and my husband hasnt gotten a raise and the price of things have gone up theres not enough for anything extra
9277554 when asked why they were working past 65 many said it was because of health care and money in terms of downturns of the economy the only other time when this was an issue was the late 1990s when the stock market was plummeting so many peoples pensions are driven by the stock market
9277555 the economy was taking my other income away because people werent getting luxury things like designer drapes my planner suggests i take social security at 62
9277556 this is a group that is completely different from the generation 10 years ago that retired because now during the first 15 years of retirement they are much healthier

9277563 even though i took dialysis with me i wasnt thinking about it because i was more concerned with making sure they were enjoying themselves

9277569 det r en av orsakerna men man bed mde ocks att det fanns tidsm ssigt utrymme f r att skicka ett annat insatsf rband
9277570 eu har f rs kt bygga in mekanismer f r att underl tta f r stridsgrupperna att anv ndas bland annat gemensamma finansieringsprinciper men d uppst r pl tsligt argument f r l nder som har ett l gre engagemang att tycka att insatsen r on digt dyr principen har blivit bromsande vi har inlett diskussioner inom f rsvarsministerkretsar om hur vi ska underl tta f r eu att ta sina insatsstyrkor i bruk men jag r vertygad om att man kan skicka i v g en stridsgrupp om alla f ruts ttningar r r tt
9277571 vi vet att uppdraget att h lla ett f rband i beredskap utf rdes f red mligt vi var redo att rycka ut den nordiska stridsgruppen har varit en testb nk f r det framtida svenska f rsvaret
9277572 vi har gnat hela v ren t att f rb ttra ekonomistyrningen inom f rsvaret det r helt okej att ha h ga ambitioner f r nordic battle group och att prioritera det framf r annan verksamhet men problemet r n r man inte synligg r de kade kostnaderna i tid och balanserar dem i tid
9277573 nej nbg r en del av uppgiften f r f rsvaret ansvaret ligger p myndigheten att hantera sin ekonomi och sina pengar
9277574 f r sverige r det h r en stor sak och vi har goda h ga ambitioner vi har byggt god samverkansf rm ga med fyra andra l nder och tillf rt f rsvaret ny kunskap det h r har varit en viktig katalysator f r omst llningen av f rsvaret
9277575 theres a difference between taking it at 62 and 65 but i cant run the risk of not being able to survive until im 66
9277576 im 62 this january being independently employed i need to put away for taxes my income was getting less and less all the time i needed all of it to pay bills i have to be very careful in planning everything

9277582 jag k nner en viss oro f r att det politiska konceptet inte var lika f rdigt som det milit ra

9277593 im essentially asking both sides to listen to each other
9277594 many seniors are living in isolation and they may not be living on any more than social security
9277595 if theres a new proposal we need to look at it and give it to the community to get their feedback for any plan
9277596 the idea of converting magnolia glen into an assisted senior living facility is an alternative that has been brought up very recently
9277597 we would welcome the opportunity to learn more about the proposal
9277598 every property we run is either for the elderly homeless or disabled
9277599 im a marketing guy so thats one thing that i have in my favor i believe
9277600 youve got to touch as many people as you can

9277603 i know them all but i think hes my favorite
9277604 you can go to wal mart nyse wmt for 4
9277605 we found in many cases that people living just down the street from a primary care clinic dont even know they exist
9277606 you have to be continually working on outreach and promotion of services
9277607 have to want to do that to begin with then they have to come up with effective ways of doing it
9277608 will take effort and itll take time and itll take diligence
9277609 if i see a disproportionate share from any particular zip code then i think you need to go back and visit with that
9277610 lots and lots of doctors around this state send their patients to the er because they know thats the only way people can get specialty care sometimes
9277611 get the message out that its inappropriate for you to come to the er if an alternative is available for non urgent care
9277612 i do whatever i can do in one visit but i have no clinic to refer to in those situations
9277613 when we came back we said we can do that and need to do that
9277614 we have about 30 dentists who regularly rotate through but we could use hundreds and hundreds more
9277615 weve got everything we need to see patients except dentists
9277616 usually by the time they come to us they are in bad shape
9277617 we try to work them in we triage for pain
9277618 it is hard and requires a big commitment of resources and people
9277619 it is dreaming the impossible dream which i felt a lot over the last few years
9277620 but if we can be a catalyst to get more people on board then we are willing to be that

9277675 coach lovie smith gave me a call and said usually these calls are bad but i just wanted to let you know you made it
9277676 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations

9277690 film is an unbelievably literal medium unless the person whos making the movie can transcend that
9277691 bob marley hes probably got virtually the same genes as me
9277692 i think all jamaicans have a bit of scots blood and english blood i call it the belligerent island my father was very argumentative i think they stick up for themselves they definitely win races at the olympics
9277693 we were the only mixed race family in southall middlesex
9277694 i cant say i had anything to grumble about i must admit though being aware of american history ive always said i was very glad i was born in england
9277695 i found that after two days i could play tea for two in the lower register along with a benny goodman record
9277696 wed go down to 52nd street and had to choose between seeing bird parker erroll garner eddie condon you name it
9277697 that resulted in me being booked on a tour of sweden one night i was the opening act for reed master sidney bechet and he invited me to play on a couple of numbers
9277698 then back in england to my amazement benny goodman rang my house and asked if id like to play second alto on a gig i did that for two weeks
9277699 so in 1949 i played with those three names in a single year it spanned from the very modern to one of the last of the living originals like bechet with benny goodman in the middle
9277700 i did have four octaves but ive lost a bit of it as ive gotten older
9277701 i hit the high notes but not as high as before it worked for a long time but now i dont need to go up into the stratosphere

9277705 se il pdl insiste per discriminare la destra in favore di altri perder le regionali del 2010 e le amministrative 2009 come gi accaduto alle provinciali di roma
9277706 in una stagione politica senza contenuti a la repubblica pensano che a destra siamo tutti ancora brutti sporchi e cattivi
9277707 this is not something you buy to take the kids out flying
9277708 its not easy to fly and not easy to maintain if you buy one of these you must know what youre doing
9277709 and no the national championship air races operational people the air bosses the pilots and crews we do everything we can to maintain safety we know what were doing we fly the airplanes a lot my crew knows the airplane backward i think were doing the best we can and the only thing i can say is that things happen outside of our control and thats when accidents happen
9277710 everyone from the faa to the air races personnel to my crew the pilots everybody is focused on safety and its not just because of last year
9277711 but just like anyone else you have to prove yourself
9277712 if they are going to race that close to you they want to make sure you know what youre doing
9277713 it probably is 10 minutes for the whole race but its the most focused 10 minutes of your life
9277714 imagine strapping your butt to an engine and going 180 miles an hour with seven other airplanes all around you
9277715 i control the lighting in the daytime god controls the lighting
9277716 we were in new orleans just yesterday to screen the movie in the lower ninth ward its like a ghost town you can drive for block after block through a neighborhood that used to have the highest percentage of black home ownership and there are no houses left standing its pretty shameful
9277717 she shot this footage thinking if we dont survive this this tape will show people how we died thats how serious it was
9277718 across the parking lot from the national guard armory the red cross had set up a shelter in this sports stadium while i was interviewing the head of the shelter kimberly and scott just stepped in front of the camera and started to tell their story we were instantly engaged
9277719 when youre making a documentary it really doesnt matter what you have in your head or on the page what matters is whats happening right in front of you
9277720 working with michael moore we learned that theres no such thing as objective storytelling
9277721 we dont appear onscreen in this film and you dont hear our voices but we definitely have a passionate point of view michael also showed how a movie can inspire public debate thats why were taking this film out during an election season we think there should be a lot more attention on what is not happening in new orleans today
9277722 we were very much uplifted by the process of making this film and getting to know kimberly who defied everyones expectations even her own
9277723 im not simply showing a love story between two men i wanted to show a slice of the city that has become an arena of desires through the love of two men i wanted to explore the themes of desire and class
9277724 the important thing is to tell the same story in a different way and seven sins lends itself to a different approach because the character is much darker than your normal hero hes someone who grew up in the mafia so its in the style of the godfather but for a new generation
9277725 im always attracted to the way james bond and jason bourne films take place in all these exotic locales and in this story too we have this very rich international canvas
9277726 of course you have to find the right writer and director to develop the thing but if you do it right tyrant could be more than just one film it could be a franchise
9277727 i think everyone is great and the world is fantastic
9277728 and theres so much more to be said i was left with the feeling that there are a couple of plays to be written about my time in high school this one is about high school as a microcosm of urban america but i think theres another play a more private intimate play that would explore the emotional and family side of high school
9277729 i had this overwhelming sense of responsibility to portray what it was like
9277730 someone said that the real world isnt like college its like high school college is this weird blip where people are interested in nuanced conversations high school is quick everything happens fast and bullies have a lot of power those things are true of the real world as well
9277731 as adults we have a censorial mechanism a huge colander in our heads filtering language and what we think should or shouldnt could or couldnt be said
9277732 when kids encounter that censor in high school they have a much more difficult time dealing with it were comfortable playing different roles for different people and the politics of daily behavior but kids are wildly vulnerable in that area everything is folded into their emerging identity
9277733 we had to find out who we were and survive high school you find the community that supports you the friends the teachers and you wear constant armor whether its nice guy armor or thug armor we all did it

9277735 i was working at the polls as a volunteer in 2004 and while we were being oriented we were told that people were reporting that when they vote for kerry theyre getting bush
9277736 said fadiman whose earlier documentaries on abortion rights garnered her an oscar nomination and an emmy win
9277737 what we have here is an extraordinarily compelling case that our electoral system has gone terribly wrong
9277738 weve got one election after another that makes no sense whatsoever they may have been rigged they may have failed due to error but because they cant be audited its 100 percent faith based voting
9277739 the kerry bush error has occurred all over the country and they seem to constantly benefit the republican over the democrat if this is a random error that occurs because the machines are crappy it should be 50 50
9277740 sometimes the criticisms are not factual because they are based on incorrect assumptions such as networking or the presence of wireless ports on machines on other occasions the studies have recommended valuable improvements theres no question that the emphasis on system security by voters election officials and the industry is much greater now than it was say five years ago
9277741 i think the key issue right now is voter confidence
9277742 watchdogs are appreciated for people to say hey we need to pay attention to this thats a great thing but the naysayer community is marketing fear and intimidation
9277743 i am committed to helping ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year
9277744 it was a serious error in judgment that never should have occurred
9277745 in the aftermath of that mistake we instituted new prohibitions against any political contributions or support by the management and staff of our company
9277746 ballot layout was determined to be the most likely explanation for the 18 000 non votes in the 2006 sarasota county election
9277747 it turns out between 1996 and 2006 when you see these discrepancies between exit polls and vote tallies they go in one direction so thats like saying a film about slavery is partisan because you dont give equal credence to the position of slave owners
9277748 if the republicans stole this election the democrats were willing accomplices
9277749 there were lots of tears in the interviews anger sadness frustration
9277750 theres only one tear in the film kim akins an african american attorney doing election protection
9277751 i dont love this genre so therefore this movie is lousy

9277754 stone said while taking a break from a rush editing job to get the film into theaters before the election
9277755 my nixon was dark and brooding w is a souffle compared to that it is lighter
9277756 i had a great story to tell about how someone who was a bum and a failure and who hadnt done jack s until 40 became the most powerful person in the world i give him full credit for the way he turned his life around
9277757 josh is better looking but he has something of a rural american about him and a lot of cowboy
9277758 i wanted to do it because the man has had tremendous impact on this world and he is not going to go away in january his policies will stay around
9277759 i got a summons to come he was very friendly he used a lot of body language and a lot of touching like politicians do i remember the breakfast vividly i felt in my heart that this guy would go all the way his confidence level was so high
9277760 were not salacious in our approach we didnt get into cocaine although i heard quite a lot about it but we needed to show bushs rebellion we show him in jail
9277761 i didnt use my dad to get into the role other than to know what it is like to want to carve out your own path when youre headed toward the same goal
9277762 i wondered how i was going to get his voice down
9277763 i am not a stand up comic who does 15 seconds of brilliant impersonation i had to sustain a voice for two hours early bush had this trajectory of getting breathier and breathier
9277764 oliver is from brooklyn so what does he know from cowboys
9277765 this is the guy rebellious doing things his own way a bit of an outsider not necessarily brilliant but intuitive and emotionally intelligent
9277766 the bitch of living comes out of a scene in latin class that is dominated by a very exacting professor you see the lead melchior defending his friend moritz from being really humiliated and possibly being struck by the teacher you see melchior get hit a couple times by the teacher and you get the sense of the serious repression of the classroom and the way these boys really have to toe the line the song is the antithesis of that it expresses anger frustration longing passion like all the songs its about interior life being expressed through song with bitch theres no unison of movement each one of the six boys is having an unbelievable kinesthetic journey and each one is singing a different vocal line very contrapuntal its a really complicated number
9277767 i told the boys in rehearsal i suspect many of you are artists because you are pushing against something in this number the boys are expressing their outrage and repression what does that look like in your bodies we worked out that these boys are comrades but still quite alienated and alone they dont understand the feelings in their bodies to them living is a bitch one of them sings god my whole lifes like some test and weve all had that feeling the choreography comes out of contact improvisation which incorporates jujitsu and aikido counterweight and counterplay that makes for unpredictable choreography i wanted them to break out of their bodies and break the chairs in the classroom behave in an athletic chaotic way we did a lot of that but some of it got in the way of the singing
9277768 the song the bitch of living replaced one of the first songs we wrote for the piece called a comet on its way it was one of everyones favorite songs and it was really an ode to masturbation sung by melchior and moritz but michael mayer had trouble with it musically i wrote two versions of a new song one was sung by moritz and it focused more on the angel he sings about at the beginning of bitch the other version the one we used brought all the boys in and tackled the onset of puberty the outrage of living and getting through the pressure of school girls who dont pay attention to you boys you have a crush on i gave it to duncan sheik and he set it pretty much as i wrote it
9277769 i think one of michaels problems with the original song was that it was midtempo with a vibe y clean electronic guitar like massive attack bitch worked better because its more visceral and less 90s throwback more of a straight ahead rock song ill say in all sincerity that its really good he kept pushing me and steven to do things that had a higher energy factor left to our own devices thered be just one sad ballad after another
9277770 i remember when bitch arrived and this extraordinary process happened duncan and steven did amazing things with the song with this time change in it to give it emphasis then bill t came in to work with the six boys on their chairs and infused it with explosive testosterone laden urge and rock star fantasy then vocal arranger annmarie milazzo came in to add layers and duncan and music director kimberly grigsby brought in the rock band and the edge became palpable in the show that song is also when the neon lights in the set go on for the first time and the song just becomes an explosive colorful event
9277771 when we were in final rehearsals for the first production at the atlantic theatre in new york 2006 i remember watching the bitch of living for the first time with band and choreography i turned to steven and said oh my god this is going to work this is so effing cool i understood that the conceit of the show the crazy idea of mixing the 19th century and the contemporary was actually going to work
9277772 i remember that day seeing bitch come together for the first time
9277773 my brother is a sage in his own peculiar way
9277774 oh ive stolen many a shot ive gone into aquariums ive gone into certain establishments which will remain nameless all of the unlikely places because i felt that we should not be beholden to society or rules of normal filmmaking i dont care about normal filmmaking i want to be out where we feel and experience something that were not going to know what it is till it happens
9277775 when your mind is going around mortgages and parking and all that kind of stuff whats really bottom line gets confused but when youre down on a survival level you know pretty much what youre going to think about what you have to think about
9277776 that were all players and that behavior begins in the womb and the only thing that we are prepared to do is to be and do and being and doing is what this is all about it nobody needs to be trained
9277777 getting out of my own way and to be smart enough to know when youre being jobbed when things arent true
9277778 weve done some wild scary things and yet theres only one time when i felt that somebody had gone to a place where they needed to be conducted away and helped only one time in 14 years
9277779 i tell people there is no scene there is no movie here there are just some people doing things and you are one of them and i do that for a number of reasons including to relax people this is not a thing where you have to achieve its a thing that you have to experience and if you experience it truthfully and with your heart and with your whole being youll be undeniable
9277780 cinematically cassavetes and bergman i feel that bergmans about trying to build order because order got broken and cassavetes is about trying to muddle through the chaos without necessarily trying to build anything out of it
9277781 the artist is a window and a mirror its about witness its about pilgrimage its about trying to entertain and ascertain the way things seem to be i cant bear to use the word truth because it has so many wrong resonances through religion and through certainties that people have
9277782 everybody people want to fight against the films that they think are a little too tough or a little ugly or a little too something theyre used to hallmark cards we live in america and we want a certain kind of a lyrical or established beauty
9277783 you know i really did like cloverfield its a nutty film it is a totally absurd filled with filmmakers jokes about apocalypse the way it would probably really be with feckless people running through the subways without any idea what theyre doing but the serious answer is come and see the elem klimov film ive never seen anything like that i mean the combination of the intimate and the epic and everything else that was in it
9277784 thatd be the next film laughs were doing a film on a willem de kooning painting woman no 1 stacy keach is going to be in that and ron perlman and some other people and were looking for a decent budget so we can spend more time and break the cycle of poverty a little bit
9277785 id probably make about 100 films id make as many films as i could i certainly wouldnt make one film thatd be nuts
9277786 they shared a vernacular god that term sounds so art but its true
9277787 they were in the generation coming from skateboarding and punk rock and theres a look to their work
9277788 not that i would take credit but i think a lot of it was developed by the artists getting to know each other in both supportive and competitive ways
9277789 ive been criticized quite a bit for not taking a stand on this for not saying corporations are evil
9277790 but this documentary is not my story different artists have different limits on how far theyll go
9277791 mike mills for instance rejected the art world he studied at cooper union with hans haacke one of the biggest conceptual artists in the world but for him working with the commercial mainstream was the most punk rock thing he could do the art world wasnt the world he wanted to deal in
9277792 but then theres chris johanson who grew up in san jose a skateboarder who moved to the mission and hes adamant about buying things locally being anti corporate hell design a t shirt for a sandwich shop near his house but thats it thats where hes at with it
9277793 im still pretty broke all of the artists in the film are to tell the truth
9277794 for two years this movie was a disaster the worst movie ever made
9277795 hopefully that came across in the movie barry said make her alive and in the film shes just as alive as anyone else
9277796 the fact that im almost 40 and i still refer to myself as a kid i could pretty much vouch for the group that were in a state of suspended adolescence
9277797 but as ed templeton says in the film children grow up and lose the ability to play and i feel lucky to never have lost it im older and i have a lot of life experiences success and tragedy but i still like to goof around and make crap
9277798 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
9277799 sean has done a lot of studying of harveys speeches
9277800 i think that is what film and art and music do they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings

9277934 i can see wembley stadium from where i live and to have the opportunity to get that ball and blast it in the back of the net would be mad

9277958 creo que la convocatoria a refer ndum de la constituci n pol tica del estado cumple con una constante demanda de los sectores sociales e ind gena de bolivia que esperaban esta medida
9277959 ahora la propuesta de constituci n pol tica del estado que tanto ha costado hacer va ser aprobada o rechazada por el soberano a trav s de su voto y el gobierno tiene que hacer lo que el pueblo mande
9277960 no es m s que atender al pedido de los diferentes sectores del pa s que quieren decidir libremente sobre la aceptaci n de la propuesta de constituci n
9277961 efectivamente la propuesta de constituci n tiene muchas de nuestras demandas que haremos conocer a nuestras comunidades guaran es
9277962 incorpora y reconoce los derechos colectivos de los pueblos ind genas
9277963 los derechos de los pueblos ind genas y adem s derechos fundamentales de los diferentes grupos y clases sociales de bolivia especialmente de aquellos que durante muchos a os no fueron tomados en cuenta o eran utilizados por intereses indiviuduales
9277964 como pueblos queremos llegar al refer ndum y decidir con nuestro voto no estamos de acuerdo con aquellos grupos que se oponen a esta consulta porque lo que quieren es callarnos violando nuestro derecho a la libre expresi n
9277965 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n

9277967 como consecuencia de lo anterior el cementerio ubicado en la comunidad de quepuca ralco qued inundado bajo las aguas del ahora lago ralco frente a esta situaci n las familias afectadas nos hemos movilizado desde esa fecha con el fin de hacer respetar el compromiso asumido por el gobierno de chile de desenterrar los cuerpos y trasladarlos a otro sitio

9277973 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9277974 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9277975 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

9277999 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9278000 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9278001 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9278002 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9278003 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9278004 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9278005 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9278006 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9278007 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9278008 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9278009 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9278010 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
9278011 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9278012 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9278013 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9278014 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9278015 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9278016 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9278017 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9278018 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9278019 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9278020 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9278021 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9278022 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9278023 that they think nothing of brazenly lying democrats feel constrained by the truth
9278024 they are disciplined partisans who would vote for satan r is he was running against jesus d
9278025 in oschersleben haben wir erstmals die situation dass ich die rennstrecke schon aus meiner fr heren rennfahrerzeit kenne
9278026 ich konnte schon im ersten freien training mit dem setting anfangen und sofort richtig pushen fast so wie im qualifying
9278027 was uns allerdings noch probleme bereitet ist das aufheizend der reifen wir haben da einfach noch nicht die erfahrung um noch weiter damit zu arbeiten
9278028 im zweiten freien training lagen wir mit dem setup etwas daneben weshalb wir auch im qualifying nicht alles umsetzen konnten ich bin damit zwar zufrieden denn die gefahrene zeit und die balance im auto stimmen aber die letzten hundertstelsekunden haben wir nicht finden k nnen in der qualifikation hatte ich noch einige berholman ver bin aber doch recht zufrieden
9278029 die gelegenheit w re sicherlich gegeben da geh rt aber auch immer das qu ntchen gl ck dazu
9278030 bei 30 autos auf der strecke wird es schon ziemlich schwierig alleine den start zu berleben
9278031 von der performance her sind wir meiner meinung nach gut dabei
9278032 wir haben vier zehntel r ckstand auf den schnellsten seat in der independents trophy ich denke die kann ich herausfahren denn wir sind sehr gut ger stet es kommt aber immer darauf an wie man die ersten beiden runden bersteht
9278033 dass ich hier gewonnen habe war mehr als gl cklich
9278034 rob das ist deine erste pole position in der wtcc
9278035 ja man muss schon fast ein endlich hinzuf gen das ist ja meine allererste pole position in einem tourenwagen
9278036 und du bist nat rlich sehr gl cklich dar ber
9278037 klar das auto war fantastisch und die letzte runde war wirklich ziemlich gut ich konnte gabriele erst mit dem letzten run schlagen er hatte mich zuvor von der spitze verdr ngt und es hat wirklich einen besonders guten umlauf gebraucht um ihn noch abzufangen die runde war also tats chlich einwandfrei ein unglaubliches ergebnis nat rlich bin ich damit hochzufrieden
9278038 deine pole position kam auch etwas berraschend zumal dies das beste ergebnis darstellt das chevrolet hier bisher einfahren konnte
9278039 ja wir schienen hier schon immer probleme mit der pace der chevrolets zu haben und waren im qualifying oftmals zu langsam der speed im rennen war nie das problem denn da waren wir immer flott unterwegs
9278040 wir haben hier aber nun einmal eine sehr konkurrenzf hige meisterschaft wo ein gro er teil des wochenendes schlicht und ergreifend vom qualifying abh ngt platz eins mag den ein oder anderen berrascht haben allerdings hatten wir schon mit einer position in den top 3 gerechnet die pole ist nat rlich eine gro artige sache
9278041 du warst das letzte fahrzeug auf der strecke wie viele risiken bist du auf deiner pole runde eingegangen
9278042 naja da ging es eigentlich um alles oder nichts ich lag ja ohnehin schon an zweiter stelle man muss auch sehen dass der wm zug f r mich quasi abgefahren ist ich habe schlie lich gerade einmal halb so viele punkte wie die f hrenden
9278043 ich k mpfe jetzt also lediglich um siege und pole positions wir geben einfach alles und versuchen noch etwas mehr aus den reifen herauszuholen die strecke bot mit der zeit immer mehr grip und das habe ich nat rlich ausgenutzt die schlussrunde war dann allerdings wirklich etwas besonderes
9278044 ich bin recht zufrieden mit dem qualifying obwohl ich zw lfter geworden bin
9278045 das auto ist schlie lich sehr schwer denn ich habe 64 zusatzkilogramm an bord
9278046 man muss sich nur einmal yvan muller anschauen der in der meisterschaft ganz vorne liegt und dessen seat im qualifying immer unglaublich stark ist er schleppt quasi den gleichen ballast mit sich herum wie ich und liegt nur ganz knapp vor mir
9278047 ich kann damit also wirklich zufrieden sein er k mpft schlie lich um die meisterschaft und ich um die top 5
9278048 auch j rg m ller ist hier f r gew hnlich sehr konkurrenzf hig unterwegs es ist ja sein heimrennen auch er hat eine hnliche zusatzlast an bord und liegt sogar hinter mir
9278049 weltmeister andy priaulx hat ein leichteres auto und steht ebenfalls nur wenige r nge vor mir
9278050 ich denke es d rfte durchaus m glich sein in die top 8 vorzusto en und an diesem wochenende einige punkte abzugreifen ich bin also wirklich gl cklich denn das team arbeitet einfach klasse
9278051 ramsey county sheriffs deputies found weapons and devices to disable buses among other items in searches in the twin cities last night and today
9278052 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9278053 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9278054 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9278055 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9278056 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9278057 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9278058 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9278059 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9278060 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9278061 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9278062 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9278063 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9278064 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9278065 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9278066 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9278067 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9278068 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9278069 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9278070 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9278071 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9278072 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9278073 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9278074 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9278075 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9278076 who are open to doing something on the production side
9278077 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9278078 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9278079 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9278080 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9278081 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9278082 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9278083 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9278084 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9278085 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9278086 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9278087 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9278088 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9278089 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9278090 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9278091 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9278092 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9278093 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9278094 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9278095 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9278096 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9278097 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9278098 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9278099 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9278100 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9278101 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9278102 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9278103 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9278104 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9278105 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9278106 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso

9278109 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
9278110 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9278111 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9278112 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

9278117 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9278118 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9278119 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9278120 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9278132 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9278133 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9278136 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9278137 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9278138 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9278139 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

9278150 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9278151 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9278152 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9278153 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9278154 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9278155 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9278156 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9278157 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9278167 tiago du warst als dritter ebenfalls in den fight um die pole position verwickelt
9278168 ja das war eine sehr enge geschichte ich lag ja zun chst eine hundertstelsekunde hinter rob ehe gabriele noch einmal nachlegte eine unglaubliche knappe entscheidung es liegen viele fahrer innerhalb von nur einer einzigen sekunde und das ist doch das absolut erstaunliche
9278169 das wochenende hat f r uns recht gut begonnen denn wir haben ein richtig gutes setup ich habe mich im qualifying regelrecht wohl gef hlt und konnte ordentlich pushen beim letzten versuch habe ich die kerbs zu arg mitgenommen und meine front besch digt konnte also nicht mehr kontern aber ich bin trotzdem sehr zufrieden es ist nun einmal so dass dich ein kleiner fehler ziemlich teuer zu stehen kommt
9278170 ich freue mich ber die zweite startreihe das ist eine gro e sache wir wollen hier einen weiteren schritt richtung meisterschaft unternehmen daher ist es gut zwei unserer wagen vorne mit dabei zu haben wir d rften also recht gut aufgestellt sein im rennen kann zwar alles m gliche passieren aber bislang haben wir gro artige arbeit geleistet
9278171 deine schnellste runde von heute war ber drei zehntel schneller als die pole position aus dem vorjahr wie erkl rst du dir diese verbesserung
9278172 daf r gibt es sicherlich mehrere erkl rungen wom glich hat der kurs einfach etwas mehr grip als im vorjahr aber nat rlich arbeiten auch alle wie verr ckt am auto wir haben gute fortschritte gemacht chevrolet ebenfalls und auch bmw alle pushen stark und das feld ist so eng beieinander da purzeln die zeiten nun einmal denn jeder hier ist am limit
9278173 gabriele du h ttest beinahe die pole position geholt wie schon im vorjahr
9278174 ja dieser kurs hier z hlt auf alle f lle zu meinen lieblingsstrecken im vergangenen jahr hatte ich hier schon die pole position inne und bis kurz vor schluss lag ich auch in diesem jahr ganz vorne ich bin allerdings sehr zufrieden mit dieser rennstrecke und nat rlich auch mit meinem auto
9278175 der wagen sieht richtig stark und konkurrenzf hig aus ich habe die sessions am morgen damit zugebracht den wagen abzustimmen aber unser auto war im qualifying einfach wieder spitze wie blich ich freue mich sehr in der ersten reihe zu stehen das ist sehr wichtig vor allem nat rlich im hinblick auf die meisterschaft
9278176 deine gr ten rivalen yvan muller und andy priaulx haben nicht besonders gut abgeschnitten es scheint also f r dich zu laufen im moment
9278177 ja schon im rennen sieht das aber schon wieder ganz anders aus in brands hatch kam ich beispielsweise vom 18 startplatz und habe dennoch punkte geholt vieles h ngt nat rlich von der ersten kurve ab denn das ist ein sehr enger knick
9278178 nach den ersten paar runden m ssen wir aber an die meisterschaft denken davor will ich dar ber eigentlich nicht nachdenken sondern nur so schnell fahren wie m glich ich habe einfach ein fantastisches auto wof r ich meinem team danken muss
9278179 ich bin vielmehr entt uscht weil meine letzte runde nicht hingehauen hat
9278180 ich bin der letzten kurve etwas aufgehalten worden und habe da einige zehntel liegen lassen
9278181 ohne diese vorkommnisse h tte ich sicherlich etwa platz acht erreichen k nnen
9278182 das ist nat rlich immer irgendwo das ziel ich bin etwas traurig aber das ist nun einmal teil der meisterschaft bei 30 autos auf der strecke ist es immer schwierig eine freie runde zu finden
9278183 naja von platz sechs bis hin zum letzten im feld hofft wahrscheinlich jeder darauf
9278184 das ist wohl mit die am meisten umk mpfte position in der gesamten meisterschaft p1 einmal ausgenommen ob du nun erster oder zweiter bist diese punkte hast du wenigstens schon sicher
9278185 wenn du auf frischen reifen f hrst hast du vielleicht die chance zu berholen aber du musst versuchen auf anderen wegen positionen gutzumachen
9278186 wenn man allein und schnell f hrt dann kann man viele pl tze gut machen
9278187 im vergangenen jahr ist zum beispiel bernd schneider als sechster gestartet war immer allein auf der strecke und hat gewonnen
9278188 der schl ssel zum erfolg wird sein dass man immer so viel wie m glich frei fahren kann
9278189 da ist hier mehr m glich da das boxenstoppfenster weiter auseinander liegt
9278190 der schl ssel zum erfolg wird sein dass man immer so viel wie m glich frei fahren kann da muss man das richtige fenster finden deshalb denke ich dass sehr unterschiedliche strategien gew hlt werden
9278191 aber ich glaube nicht dass es hier zu problemen kommt

9278201 we never did the ten worst places to visit only the ten best
9278202 is arguably the largest cluster of industrial sectors in the world
9278203 recognize our limitations and how we have to regulate our resources
9278204 when the war was over cambodia and the khmer rouge revolution
9278205 my addictions are so contemptible and pathetic i cant reveal them to the public
9278206 the brueghel of the last half of the 20th century
9278207 crumb is everything you would look for in a great artist
9278208 he speaks very directly to a specific cultural moment unflinchingly and he also explores universal themes and existential issues that keep you up at night
9278209 emerges out of a deep sense of the absurdity of human life there arent any heroes or heroines there arent any villains and the victims are comic americans find that very hard to take because it conflicts with their basic mixture of utopianism on one hand and puritanism on the other
9278210 a friend came up to me and said burns theres this comic that you need to see
9278211 its a free line from his brain to his hand
9278212 if jack kirby was the king of superhero comics crumb is the king of underground comics
9278213 but when you start reading it and a lot of it is rough stuff you see the truth in it and the humor and the satire and irony
9278214 the thing i admire most about him is that hes never been satisfied with his early success hes constantly challenging and pushing himself
9278215 its the whole tangled snarl of 20th century american culture hes trying to come to terms with and you cant just laugh at it or distance yourself from it because he doesnt do that
9278216 oh that is venerable maha ghosananda he is very famous in cambodia
9278217 looking at the venerable ghosananda one has the impression that not only his smile but his whole body is radiant
9278218 one thing however is obvious whatever his experience has been it has brought forth extraordinary growth in the spiritual life
9278219 he learned that his parents and all his brothers and sisters had been murdered
9278220 having mindfulness his teacher said is like knowing when to open and when to close your windows and doors mindfulness tells us when is the appropriate time to do things you cant stop the fighting instead fight your impulses toward sorrow and anger be mindful prepare for the day when you can truly be useful to your country stop weeping and be mindful
9278221 great suffering and great love merged centuries of buddhist devotion rushed into the consciousness of the refugees waves of survivors fell to their knees and prostrated wailing loudly their cries reverberating throughout the camp many say that the dharma which had slept gently in their hearts as the bodhi tree burned was reawakened that day
9278222 we must find the courage to leave our temples and enter the temples of human experience temples that are filled with suffering if we listen to the buddha christ or gandhi we can do nothing else the refugee camps the prisons the ghettoes and the battlefields will then become our temples
9278223 we have great compassion for them because they do not know the truth
9278224 they suffer so much they burn themselves they want peace they want happiness and buddhism gives them peace and happiness
9278225 i do not question that loving ones oppressors cambodians loving the khmer rouge may be the most difficult attitude to achieve but it is a law of the universe that retaliation hatred and revenge only continue the cycle and never stop it reconciliation does not mean that we surrender rights and conditions but rather that we use love in our negotiations it means that we see ourselves in the opponent for what is the opponent but a being in ignorance and we ourselves are also ignorant of many things therefore only loving kindness and right mindfulness can free us
9278226 for maha ghosananda the essence of buddhist dharma is the practice of peacemaking it requires skilful means the ability to listen with compassion to the perspective of the one who has done you and others harm and being mindful and selfless in negotiating a peaceful resolution to conflict
9278227 wisdom and compassion must walk together having one without the other is like walking on one foot you will fall balancing the two you will walk very well step by step
9278228 we khmer havent seen peace for so long weve never known it now seeing the monks and all these people walking makes me think theyve come to teach us to love one another to unite when i see them i feel speechless maybe we will have true peace after all
9278229 change in terms of actively following the middle path not in social or political confrontation
9278230 each step is a meditation each step is a prayer
9278231 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
9278232 more than 50 per cent of the active female population contribute to the economy of their country
9278233 the problem is that this contribution is still mainly in the informal sector
9278234 the challenge cambodian women face is not just to access employment but decent better paying employment
9278235 positive trends towards greater equality include increasing girls enrolment in primary education and resulting rises in female literacy and expanded employment opportunities
9278236 if textiles goes youll have 300 000 people employed today on the road tomorrow not to mention supporting businesses large and small including mine that would also be in trouble
9278237 the attitude is very much let foreign businesses come and do it but no work has been done on paving the way and targeting what investment they want
9278238 to raise their participation in formal employment and decision making institutions women need skills and information about how markets and the law function
9278239 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
9278240 are you talking about the informal sector where women are already heavily represented or 8am to 5pm professional jobs
9278241 we are not going to increase womens participation in professional jobs until we have things like adequate child care facilities care for older people and salaries that keep up with the cost of living
9278242 in order to participate in economic activity and contribute to the economy you have to be healthy
9278243 the high rate of maternal mortality while declining is a real concern and a real challenge we need to look at why with all the aid we have received this has not decreased more in the past
9278244 this is also a cultural problem the woman is the last to get medical attention after the children and the father they are in bad shape by the time they come to the doctor
9278245 have improved at all levels of education the female share of enrolment drops at each higher level of education
9278246 the cambodian government is committed to increasing education opportunities for women at all levels from primary school to university during the next five year mandate
9278247 we have some vocational training centres now but not enough and they are not responding to demand this is important in the context of the garment industry which we not only want to stay in cambodia but to value add and not just use labour
9278248 we are not sure about the exact numbers but they are significant
9278249 although we are concerned about the conditions some of these women face overseas we the government encourage labour migration due to the level of local unemployment

9278256 what was not generally known on the day that alexander litvinenko died was that the polonium had been discovered only in one of the final urine samples taken from him
9278257 the lethal dose measured a tiny fraction of a microgram a mere speck but it was far more than was needed to guarantee his death this was no ordinary murder
9278258 the death of litvinenko would come to be seen as a defining moment of the putin presidency putin sought to restore moscows greatness the death of litvinenko ensured that russias reputation as a land to be feared for the worst of reasons was revived for all the world to see

9278267 when during their work hours he looked at her he felt his heart lurch he wanted to take her in his arms right there in front of all the chefs through his long shifts at the sinks he listened for the sound of her voice his longing for the night was profound when he looked at his own reflection he saw a young man his eyes wild with dreams

9278283 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9278284 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9278285 but no by your lord they can have no faith until they make you judge in all disputed matters between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decision and accept them with full submission

9278296 my lord make this a peaceful land and protect me and my children from worshiping idols
9278297 and make not allahs name an excuse in your oaths against doing good or acting rightly or making peace between persons for allah is one who heareth and knoweth all things
9278298 you shall not make wrongful use of the name of the lord your god
9278299 if anyone takes a solemn oath that he would do or refrain from doing such and such a thing and thereupon realizes that something else would be a more righteous course then let him do that which is more righteous and let him break his oath and then atone for it
9278300 o you who believe when the congregational prayer salat al jumu ah is announced on friday you shall hasten to the commemoration of god and drop all business
9278301 anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes it shall be as if he murdered all the people

9278317 with the inauguration of chorka a new world has been opened up in our busy city life it will reduce the hassles of shopping
9278318 it could open up a new horizon in the field of information technology if it gets government assistance
9278319 chorka aims to facilitate the spread of bangladeshi brands from remote local places to abroad
9278320 we are also targeting customers who dont have credit cards
9278321 chorka is opening up a new window for shop owners to generate a complete new revenue stream with almost zero investment it will also help to promote our brand worldwide
9278322 we are negotiating with airbus the delivery date of a second a380 airbus notified emirates of a possible delay of a few weeks

9278324 the boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board

9278327 it makes a lot of sense to change the map of the middle east
9278328 building a democracy that is based upon the notion of the rule of the majority is a disaster for us
9278329 there is a need to establish the soil under which the seeds of liberal democratic institutions can take root
9278330 bidens views on certain regional issues such as dividing iraq along sectarian lines and his staunch support for israel have disappointed arabs
9278331 however they trust that obama is not a war president they also recognise that biden is a sharp foreign policy man
9278332 obamas choice of deputy confirms that the real change he is after is a personal one to leap from his seat in the senate to the presidential chair
9278333 biden is a firm supporter of israel but the way he sees the uss role in the middle east doesnt necessarily reflect jerusalems ideal of the ideal american partner
9278334 while lieberman is a favourite on the single issue of israel biden is more in synch with jewish voters on the broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues
9278335 attempt to place himself in the light of practical policy rather than as the brash idealist many of us came to love
9278336 because the brash idealists are never successful so id like to think that his inner idealist is driving him
9278337 i would get in touch with them on behalf of the son of justice fazlul huq
9278338 using his btv press pass nuruzzaman accessed classified documents from the anticorruption commission on fazlul huqs assets information
9278339 we will look to hammer out security issues in the meeting
9278340 curbing criminals activities narcotics smuggling and trafficking in women and children and the tin bigha corridor will be discussed in the meeting
9278341 syed ashraful islam accused tarique of being the world champion of corruption but no truth in the cases filed against has been found
9278342 if you have any specific allegation you file a case against tarique dont make accusations without substantiating it with facts and figures
9278343 if the world champion of corruption is released from jail the present government has no moral right to keep other persons who are accused of corruption detained
9278344 the jail authorities allowed the visit as a former prime minister made the request
9278345 law and constitution are being violated there is no rule of law all of us are now helpless
9278346 i dont know how they could have done it any better
9278347 obama had an opportunity to get his message across to a record breaking crowd of millions of american voters and he used it effectively

9278356 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off

9278359 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9278360 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9278361 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9278362 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9278363 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9278364 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9278365 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9278366 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9278367 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9278368 they wanted to make an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resources

9278374 we must take comprehensive and integrated steps to combat the adverse effects of global warming on food security
9278375 bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change given its geography as a low lying mega delta with three large river systems accompanied by heavy rainfall floods have become an annual calamity
9278376 the greatest challenge bangladesh faces is lifting some 50 million people out of poverty with adequate food shelter drinking water and health care
9278377 this challenge is made all the more difficult for bangladesh because global warming has already started to affect food production helping to raise food deficits over the last two decades
9278378 the melting of the himalayan glaciers and huge sediments carried by the rivers coupled with restricted drainage further worsen the situation
9278379 we have transformed the icelandic economy from being predominantly dependent on fossil fuel into a world leader in the production and consumption of clean energy
9278380 if four pillars of modern society scientific communities governments business sectors and civic associations can unite and combine their resources we can build the foundations for enormous success
9278381 we therefore need a similar call to action a visionary collaboration between brilliant minds accompanied by an invitation to all concerned citizens to become involved to be heard and counted
9278382 we are starting to wonder just what kind of community did we move into

9278400 its an honour to lead pakistan and i am doing it to the best of my ability
9278401 im going home after three years it feels really good
9278402 ive either been shooting out of the country or just been busy in mumbai its been a really hectic time for me i havent been to my home in bangalore for three years
9278403 ganesh chaturthi is a very big event in my home in bangalore
9278404 am i religious i dont go to the temple every day but my god is right here in my heart i believe in a force and that keeps me grounded
9278405 my sister is five years younger to me i sometimes envy my sister she has gone into sports like my father and she gets to play golf professionally thats a unique position for a 19 year old to be in acting seems rather ordinary in comparison
9278406 thats right she has been offered a kannada film but shes absolutely not interested in a film career one actress in the family is enough
9278407 id love to do a sports film not necessarily my dads game badminton but any sport except cricket i feel too much priority is given to cricket in our country im so glad that films on other sports like hockey and football are being made id love to do a film based on badminton
9278408 when i was told that in bachna ae haseeno i had to play an indian cab driver in australia who doesnt believe in marriage i said i had to do this even if there were two other girls in the story luckily for me i got along like a house on fire with bipasha basu and minissha lamba even if i hadnt id still have enjoyed doing the role thoroughly and not because ranbir was in it
9278409 most of my scenes in mukhbiir were with sammir when we started working together i didnt even know who he was he came across as very non filmy later i came to know he was from a business family with no bollywood connections
9278410 im very surprised by sammirs performance i think he has the potential to become a big star i told him if he was part of a film family like ranbir kapoor hed have been launched in style and become a star overnight though ranbirs debut flopped hes being written about everywhere and abhishek bachchan had 17 flops and he still got chance after chance
9278411 i at least got the support of offbeat filmmakers like shyam benegal and govind nihalani for a mainstream commercial actor today the competition is with the star sons who are launched in big lavish films who will take the same risk with an actor who isnt connected to the industry
9278412 because sammir is from outside the film industry he will have to work twice as hard to prove himself but mukhbiir would do it for sammir its a very unusual spy thriller and sammirs sensitive face leaves a lasting impact
9278413 it successfully bridges the gap between offbeat and mainstream cinema as the chairperson of the nfdc national film development council this is the kind of cinema id like the nfdc to make
9278414 doing a film where i play a rock musician is a dream come true but being on the cover of rolling stone man thats beyond a dream
9278415 as a teenager i used to dream of being in rolling stone now its come true im quite kicked about it were featured because weve made the first film based on rock music from this country also lets not forget shankar ehsaan loy are full on musicians even if me and the rest of the cast are not
9278416 but yes the only indian musician who featured before us on the rolling stone cover was a r rahman so i cant pretend im not kicked
9278417 the response was very encouraging im feeling more confident about the film
9278418 i wont be seeking out roles or creating characters for myself so i could act
9278419 at the moment ive two films to direct voice from the sky and the sequel to don only then will i think of another acting assignment
9278420 that would depend entirely on the director abhishek kapoor and the kind of script hed find again if the plot is exciting why not a sequel for now were all completely satisfied with rock on whatever i thought wed be able to achieve weve done it theres no sense of disappointment or incompleteness regardless of which way the box office goes
9278421 lets wait and watch we will see what we can do
9278422 it is a 90 minute fun filled film with four and a half minutes of animation where the two children take the audience for a joy ride
9278423 it is a film about two children and the power of presence of mind and how the kids create a lot of hilarious sequences
9278424 i think the music will be quite outstanding as we have tried to create fun filled music keeping in mind the storyline

9278448 les gaulois daujourdhui connaissent bien le sanglier cet animal au temp rament combatif qui prolif re dans toutes nos for ts des pyr n es au rhin en montagne comme en plaine 1 charg dans nos esprits dune certaine valeur symbolique il repr sente un peu lincarnation de ce qui reste de nature sauvage et d fiant les hommes seigneur des espaces sylvestres il demeure le gibier noble par excellence embl me de la chasse 2 limportance de ce mammif re dans la culture et lesprit des gaulois a travers les poques et remonte au moins la phase celtique de notre histoire les sangliers et la chasse chez les gaulois en effet la civilisation celtique dans son ensemble sest d velopp e au contact des grandes for ts de leurope temp r e ces espaces pleins de vie de ressources expressions de la f condit de la terre o le sanglier aime voluer ce dernier est donc rapidement familier aux habitants de la gaule chass il est aussi rapidement domestiqu mais il prend de plus une valeur symbolique au moins partir de l poque lat nienne v me ier si cles av j c a cela deux raisons essentielles son importance dans lalimentation puisque domestiqu il fournit une viande abondante ses caract res morphologiques et son comportement l tat sauvage cest dire puissance courage et t nacit dans la lutte vivacit et intelligence comme le savent encore bien les chasseurs hercule h rakl s capturant le sanglier derymanthe vase attique figures noires fin du vi me si cle av j c limportance du sanglier dans la mythologie des gaulois est ainsi devenue sans commune mesure avec la place quil occupe dans les mythes gr co romains dans les r cits abondants qui constituent ces derniers le sanglier nintervient que rarement toujours sous un aspect n faste ainsi dans la l gende dhercule le troisi me de ses travaux a conduit ce h ros combattre le sanglier malfaisant qui se terrait sur erymanthe une montagne darcadie 3 ou encore dans le r cit rapport d j par hom re du sanglier monstrueux de calydon envoy par art mis dans les environs de cette cit detolie pour punir limpi t de son roi n 4 cependant contrairement une id e re ue le sanglier l tat sauvage comme le gibier en g n ral noccupaient pas une place tr s importante dans lalimentation des gaulois davant la conqu te romaine en effet p m niel 5 a montr que le produit de la chasse ne repr sentait que 6 de la viande consomm e par nos anc tres de plus ce nest pas le sanglier qui avait les faveurs des chasseurs gaulois mais le li vre et secondairement le cerf pouvant causer de gros d g ts dans les cultures le sanglier tait parfois chass pour des raisons de protection comme encore de nos jours en revanche le porc domestiqu depuis le n olithique repr sentait un apport alimentaire fondamental plus petit que le sanglier sa taille approchait celle de nos porcs actuels avec cette diff rence quil tait plus gracile et agile 6 souvent noirs et poilus les porcs gaulois pouvaient encore contrairement ses descendants actuels se confondre avec le sanglier ce qui explique peut tre la r putation de chasseurs de sangliers acquise par les gaulois en effet strabon donne une description du porc gaulois qui est peut tre lorigine de la confusion la gaule lat nienne n tait pas cet espace enti rement couvert de for ts que lon a longtemps imagin mais un territoire ouvert largement cultiv et mis en valeur dens ment peupl lalimentation des gaulois et la place du sanglier refl tent cet tat de faits malgr limportance tr s secondaire de la chasse dans lalimentation des gaulois cette pratique avait probablement une connotation sacr e dans laquelle le sanglier jouait un r le fondamental cest ce que montre en particulier la statuette dune d esse que la tradition assimile arduina la personnification des ardennes aujourdhui conserv e au mus e des antiquit s nationales de saint germain en laye photographie ci contre elle figure une divinit montant en amazone un sanglier la hure pro minente la d esse peut sans conteste tre identifi e la chasseresse art mis la diane des romains elle porte une tunique courte des sandales un carquois sur l paule droite et tient une fl che dans la main droite le sanglier repose sur une plaque de bronze perc dune fente et de deux trous qui ont fait supposer quil sagissait dune enseigne destin e tre fix e sur une hampe de bois 7 en revanche contrairement ce que toute une tradition affirme y compris dans des ouvrages r cents 8 il ne peut sagir dune personnification de la d esse arduina le lieu de d couverte de la statuette est tr s probablement le jura nous navons donc pas affaire une pr figuration de lembl me du sanglier des ardennes comme on la longtemps cru mais une repr sentation gallo romaine qui associe la diane de tradition romaine ou du moins ses attributs lanimal sacr des gaulois le sanglier ce dernier ici nest pas un animal mauvais et mena ant comme dans les mythes de tradition grecque levant la hure vers le ciel il guide limmortelle dans sa chasse divine activit sacr e la chasse fut probablement chez les gaulois une activit aristocratique au moins pour le gros gibier dont la capture n cessite du temps et des moyens importants les pratiques fun raires des gaulois refl tent limportance accord e la viande de sanglier et de porc d s l ge du bronze 2000 800 av j c on d pose dans les s pultures des d fenses de sanglier 9 l poque lat nienne cest souvent de la viande de porc qui fait office doffrande et accompagne le d funt dans sa derni re demeure on y a vu une promesse dabondance dans peut tre pour le guerrier la pr figuration du banquet divin qui attend les plus m ritants le sanglier symbole de la valeur guerri re ainsi de son importance pour lalimentation et du caract re sacr de la chasse le sanglier devient une figure animale singuli re mais cest surtout son comportement dans la lutte son habitude de faire de lattaque sa principale tactique de d fense qui ont conditionn l laboration de sa repr sentation le sanglier est avant tout un symbole guerrier les repr sentations figur es qui attestent de ce caract re abondent lune des plus c l bres est la statuette trouv e euffigneix vosges sur le territoire lingon photographie ci contre une divinit masculine portant un torque est associ e une repr sentation de sanglier comme pr t charger le poil dress la hure baiss e sa position verticale sur le torse du dieu a fait supposer quil ait pu sagir dune vocation de la consommation de viande par les guerriers et les h ros 10 lanimal agressif a pu galement symboliser la force et le courage guerriers presque identique est lattitude du sanglier d couvert neuvy en sullias loiret en pays carnute dans ce cas il sagit sans aucun doute dune enseigne destin e identifier un corps de troupes comme il en existe de nombreux exemples proches ainsi de lenseigne au sanglier d couverte soulac gironde chez les bituriges vivisques comme lattestent de nombreuses monnaies 11 ces sangliers enseignes semblent avoir t lattribut dunit s militaires mais aussi de pagi sing pagus subdivision des peuples gaulois que c sar appelle ciuitates cit s les enseignes manifestaient lexistence collective et la capacit dagir de mani re autonome vis vis des institutions centrales de la cit sanglier de bronze de neuvy en sullias enseignes au sanglier inspir es doriginaux gaulois le sanglier figure aussi sur bon nombre dobjets et quipements de la vie militaire des gaulois sur les casques les boucliers mais aussi lembouchure du carnyx cette fameuse trompette de guerre qui terrifiait les romains ci contre dans ces cas la hure du sanglier semble avoir pris une valeur apothropa que cest dire destin e d tourner vers lennemi les influences n fastes sur les monnaies gauloises le sanglier est une repr sentation des plus courantes comme nous lavons d j voqu propos des pagi il est associ soit des figures divines soit des peuples dont il repr sente alors la valeur guerri re cest le cas par exemple sur des monnaies des eduens ci dessous ou sur dautres mises par les p trocores potin au sanglier r cemment d couvert farges les m con enfin cest le nom m me de certains peuples qui d rive de lanimal pour sen attribuer les vertus combattives en effet le nom des cadurques quercy cadurci se compose probablement des deux l ments catu combat et turci les sangliers gaulois turcos au singulier cf ancien breton torch ce qui en fait donc les sangliers du combat 12 en pannonie autriche actuelle pays de peuplement celtique on conna t gr ce une inscription d poque romaine 13 un catumocus form sur le gaulois moccus porc cf breton moch et qui peut donc se comprendre comme le porc du combat anthroponyme de sens quivalent au nom des cadurques enfin un petit peuple des abords du rhin les baetasi devait sans doute son nom au gaulois baidos sanglier cf gallois baedd sanglier et pratiques religieuses la force guerri re attribu e au sanglier explique la place quil a sans doute occup e dans les pratiques religieuses des gaulois il ne fait en effet aucun doute que lanimal faisait lobjet dune d votion particuli re la trace la plus vidente en est ces petites statuettes le plus souvent en bronze figurant lanimal sauvage retrouv es par centaines partout en gaule ainsi par exemple des exemplaires conserv s au mus e de metz ci contre sur le territoire des anciens m diomatriques ou encore de celui conserv au mus e de bibracte en terre duenne ces petits sangliers de bronze jouaient sans doute le r le doffrandes votives destin es un dieu sanglier pr cis ment certains t moignages linguistiques attestent de lexistence de sanctuaires vou es ce type de divinit s 14 pr s de langres en territoire lingon cest dire chez le peuple m me qui a produit la statue deuffigneix fut d couverte une d dicace mercure moccus mercure porc sanglier dans la m me r gion se trouve une hauteur appel e mont mercure autrefois mont de moque sur laquelle se trouvait tr s probablement un temple mercure moccus les hauteurs lieux de s jour privil gi des morts au combat accueillaient elles fr quemment des sanctuaires du dieu sanglier protecteur des guerriers on ne peut sen assurer mais il para t en tout cas certain quexistait chez les lingons un important culte une divinit assimil e un sanglier dautres attestations dun culte similaire sont attest es ailleurs en gaule ainsi dans les alpes de haute provence une vallis moccenis devenue val des monts avait peut tre la m me fonction de sanctuaire de hauteur chez les conv nes des pyr n es bazert doit sans doute son nom un ancien sanctuaire de baesertis deus dont on a retrouv une d dicace dans les environs associant le nom une repr sentation de sanglier le nom du dieu a pu tre form sur le gaulois baidos sanglier enfin il est possible que le sanglier outre sa symbolique guerri re acquit la valeur dembl me sacerdotal h te des for ts mangeur du gland du ch ne il a pu tre rapproch de la figure du pr tre le druide de l poque gauloise classique ii me si cle av j c qui dispensait son enseignement sous les frondaisons et v n rait le ch ne plus que les autres arbres 15 la post rit l gendes et christianisme dune aussi riche tradition il devait forc ment rester quelque chose m me apr s la fin du paganisme gallo romain leglise a combattu limage et la v n ration du sanglier comme elle a combattu tous les symboles rappelant lancienne vision du monde europ enne qui int grait lhomme un ensemble unitaire m lant hommes et dieux et faisait du monde m me une entit sacr e il fallait apprendre aux gaulois comme aux autres peuples que les belles choses les plus v n rables ne sont pas de ce monde limage du porc et du sanglier sest alors peu peu transform e bien que toujours la base de notre alimentation le premier a acquis une image de salet dimpuret d lib r ment labor e par les clercs le second sorti du domaine du sacr a n anmoins conserv comme nous le soulignions au d part de ce petit texte une valeur qui en fait un animal respectable les l gendes irlandaises et galloises h riti res du vieux fonds celtique ont conserv une place lanimal embl matique de nos anc tres ainsi par exemple dans le conte gallois de kulhwch et olwen l norme sanglier malfaisant twrch trwyth ou son quivalent irlandais orc triath 16 la chasse du sanglier prend alors une valeur symbolique le roi le guerrier cherchent semparer de lantique science des pr tres les l gendes irlandaises racontent galement que dagda h ritier de lancien taranis fit lacquisition dun cochon magique que lon pouvait manger un jour et retrouver intact le lendemain on y retrouve la trace du cochon comme garant du bien tre post mortem des guerriers on est loin cependant du sanglier pos en mod le de combativit et v n r pour lui m me lomnipr sence du sanglier dans nos for ts mais probablement aussi la permanence dun imaginaire europ en propre explique que le sanglier figure encore dans lh raldique m di vale comme un animal symbolisant la force et la t nacit le fameux sanglier des ardennes sil nest peut tre pas lh ritier direct dun dieu sanglier gaulois montre n anmoins que la continuit symbolique peut prendre des voies diverses et survivre aux ruptures religieuses ou culturelles 17 il nexiste pas de synth se de fond sur la symbolique du sanglier nous renvoyons aux ouvrages et articles cit s en notes pour la bibliographie il existe un article de wikip dia sur la question mais il est tr s mauvais m lange sans discernement les donn es des sources antiques et celles des traditions m di vales insulaires ne cite que peu de sources et surtout est pollu par un excursus inutile dont le caract re id ologique

9278452 any money that retirees take out of their portfolios or that they lose in market declines in the first five years of retirement has a higher cost because its money that wont be invested to earn returns in succeeding years when the markets recover
9278453 and the less they have invested after a bear market the less potential they have to benefit from the compounding of any earnings in subsequent years
9278454 psychologically people find it hard to retire when the market is down 20 percent
9278455 thats a self imposed discipline that retirees would be wise to adhere to
9278456 you want to figure out what is the right portfolio mix for you and to also understand or have a realistic sense of how bumpy the risk is likely to be

9278465 i was very confident that the show would do well it has substance in it and a lot of entertainment value you get to enjoy bollywood stars as people they talk on tv like never before and i dont get to know of the success of the show as much from the audience it is when actors call me up and say we want to be on your show that i know the show is a hit
9278466 i dont do much research on the actors except for pre selecting the video clipping that i want to show and thats all
9278467 i dont think farah and i will make a film together she is a director in her own right but yes she did two songs for me in heyy babyy and i hope she continues doing so

9278544 this is the pitch i came up with when bobby valentine asked me to make the ball shake during the 2004 off season at first i tried a knuckleball but i couldnt throw it with the typical grip and thinking that it was enough to make the ball wiggle i arrived that the shake the grip is a forkball without the thumb when i tried this pitch i got the shaking movement
9278545 putting spin on this pitch would be pointless since the basic idea is to throw the pitch to be received in the mitt just as it is therefor i dont put any power into it and use a loose form
9278546 the grip is different but the trajectory is that of a knuckleball i didnt call it a knuckleball because if people who spent their lives mastering the knuckleball saw it they would think its wrong so i named it the shake
9278547 im still at a level where if i throw 10 only 6 will go for strikes so i still have to improve on this

9278637 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9278638 it frightens them and brings them back to the holocaust
9278639 their capacity for resilience that theyve shown since the war is amazing
9278640 the hard part is no matter what we do we cant make it ok

9278646 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
9278647 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
9278648 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
9278649 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
9278650 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
9278651 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
9278652 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
9278653 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
9278654 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
9278655 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
9278656 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses

9278659 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do
9278660 anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem
9278661 reasonable to conclude that individual student expenditures can easily approach 700 to 1 000 today even after supplies are subtracted
9278662 publishers have broken an implicit contract with academics in which we gave our time and they werent too greedy
9278663 do you think all these ph d s are so lazy so stupid they buy junk

9278671 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9278683 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully

9278685 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
9278686 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
9278687 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
9278688 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
9278689 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
9278690 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
9278691 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows

9278697 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9278698 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9278699 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9278700 it appears to be an overdose but we cant confirm that today
9278701 and then i was nominated for vice president in 2006
9278702 the process is one where they look a few years in advance
9278703 theres quite a bit that goes into the preparation part
9278704 the club sends you to district training which is three full days of what to expect as president along with the different aspects and leadership of it
9278705 by the time you become president you know what youre doing
9278706 i want to work on community building and make living in new bedford a bit easier
9278707 were looking at giving a lot more to outreach programs to get the name out what rotary is and what we do for the community
9278708 we try to support as many organizations in the area as we can
9278709 sarah lamothe is a spectacular example of what in my opinion most people who seek success aspire to become
9278710 her leadership in the rotary club of new bedford has been very significant over the years
9278711 together we can really impact the greater new bedford region and that is very important to us
9278712 we apologize for any inconvenience but webster hall will be closed saturday august 30th for a private event
9278713 crucial stage says a spokesman for reporters without borders alberta native amanda lindhout 27 and australian nigel brennan 35 were kidnapped last weekend about 20 kilometres west of mogadishu as they were leaving a refugee camp in the afgoye district leonard vincent head of the africa desk for reporters without borders told canwest news service friday that the search had entered a hopeful but perilous phase amanda lindhout seen in a 2003 photo in calgary was abducted at gun point on aug 23 in somalia
9278714 it is a crucial moment and it would be very dangerous to disclose more than that
9278715 if everything continues like it is now we can expect a positive outcome

9278718 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9278719 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9278720 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9278721 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9278722 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9278723 he stayed on after dinner and played monopoly with me
9278724 they had a rest camp in the town where i lived out in the woods every time theyd go out to battle theyd come back to the rest camp i only saw him when he came back
9278725 he read this memoir a couple of times and about the third time he sat down and wrote
9278726 dear thelma i wonder if anybody has honored your request to correspond with you if you have heard from anyone you dont need to answer this letter
9278727 id gone back there three times including the first time and when i left the third time we were unofficially engaged
9278728 chauncey is such a special person hes so sincere hes so caring
9278729 i told him hes so handsome i would have married him on the spot
9278730 its nice to see that love still exists as you get older
9278731 even if you havent had love for years you can still find it in your 90s
9278732 no way itll be very natural weve both been married before for a long time so we know what its like
9278733 you see i made the big move in the very beginning when i moved from australia to connecticut
9278734 its going to be a community night and were hoping for a great turnout
9278735 were proud of what were accomplishing here academically and athletically and we want people to know that they have a great college right in their own backyards
9278736 its not all about winning and losing but you want to be competitive and that means you have to attract quality student athletes
9278737 were trying to do everything we can to allow our coaches to field good teams and were trying to strengthen internally we want people to get excited about our sports teams and a big part of that is having successful programs
9278738 we have some very good coaches here and several of our programs have been top notch for a long long time
9278739 were looking to have success in all the sports that we offer we want to have a well rounded athletic department and were heading in the right direction i can see great things happening here in the near future
9278740 you have to have full time coaches who can get out and recruit and sell the university to student athletes
9278741 its all about balance we want all of our sports teams to be the best they can be wed love for all of our coaches to be full time someday and thats something well continue to work on
9278742 i think we hit a home run when we hired him he has a clear idea of what coaches need to do their jobs and hes embraced the university community
9278743 he cares about our students on and off the field im very happy with the direction hes taking the athletic department in we expected a lot of good things from him when he was hired and hes already delivered
9278744 ian has taken the time to get to know people on campus hes really made an effort to make himself known to students professors and administrators hes stressed to our coaches that they have to get out and recruit and he wants to get everybody excited about our sports teams
9278745 we had a good year last year and ian wants to build on that people will come to see successful teams our mens basketball and ice hockey teams have had great fan support over the years and ian would like to see that for all of our teams
9278746 ian is a very positive person and hes been fabulous to work with you can talk to him and he listens
9278747 hes made an effort to make us part of the recruiting process weve had meetings with the coaches and knowing that we can work with them hand in hand makes our jobs a whole lot easier
9278748 bob did a great job while he was here and ian has really taken the ball and run with it
9278749 hes breathed new life into the athletic department with his positive attitude and new ideas hes driving the department in a whole new direction and people all over campus are ready to get on board and take that ride with him
9278750 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9278751 and it is warm not something im really used to
9278752 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9278753 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9278754 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9278755 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9278756 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9278757 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9278758 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9278759 the award demonstrates forestview nursing homes commitment to teamwork in providing quality care to our residents
9278760 we are proud of this accomplishment this is a great honor for employees who work hard every day to take care of our residents
9278761 the massachusetts dental society has been reaching out to needy children with its mobile access dental van so we thought that it would be helpful if we expanded upon that with our program for adults i just wanted a method to give back and say thank you to the area which has brought so much happiness and success to me
9278762 this woman came up in the left lane changes lanes to go around the cruiser and then comes right back in the left lane and drives straight into the back of our fire truck we heard two or three seconds of screeching tires and then bam and her airbag punches her in the face
9278763 people freeze up they dont know what to do they sit there at red lights when they should be getting out of the way just get out of the way if the intersection is clear and theres room the cop isnt going to arrest you for getting out of the way of a fire truck
9278764 only in an extreme emergency would we do a thing like that not that we wouldnt like to
9278765 just this morning we had somebody cut us off in marion
9278766 they dont signal theres no courtesy at all for driving schools at all they harass us
9278767 people dont have courtesy for new drivers and then they complain about the kids
9278768 my son lived in my house by my rules and it was if you need to use a cell phone pull over i dont even allow students to adjust the radio or the seat while driving take responsibility
9278769 if you stop to let somebody go and youre rear ended its your fault
9278770 the local authorities are fairly cooperative when it comes to this
9278771 it comes back in our accidents we have a very low accident rate and that comes back to your insurance
9278772 the big problem is that the permit is too easy there are 20 questions on the written test and they pass with 14
9278773 in portugal where i am from it takes three months for a permit they have to know everything about the law book here the permit is so easy the kids come to the road and they dont know the signs they fail the road test on the signs they dont see the signs
9278774 we see this one lady she was going back and forth and we said something to her and she said thats ok and of course she was smoking and she was on the phone
9278775 this years theme is your town at work we are interested in what people did for work in the past in town and what they are doing today
9278776 no problem bring them over we will blow them up for you
9278777 we are looking for what we like to term that wow factor
9278778 we want somebody to take a drink stop look at the glass and say what was that
9278779 a brewery in every town is not so crazy to think about in the future
9278780 it all goes back to the movement of consuming products that are locally produced
9278781 who would have ever thought that denver colo would become the napa valley of beer
9278782 this hasnt happened because of some half billion dollar advertising campaign on behalf of the big brewers
9278783 its a kind of a blue collar connoisseurship anybody can afford to buy the worlds best beers but if you wanted to buy a bottle of the worlds best wine youd have to spend thousands of dollars
9278784 your average run of the mill lager will in most states come in around 3 8 or 4 percent alcohol these have got something like 10 or 11 percent so you are getting 2 times the alcohol delivery with them
9278785 youve got to be careful with them but they are self limiting they are very rich it would be like trying to drink a quart of whipping cream your body will reject it because they are so rich
9278786 i sell beer for 15 a bottle and i cant make enough of it
9278787 i would liken it to the wine industry where people started out liking white zinfandels
9278788 then they were ready to move on to things with more flavor like sauvignon blanc then pinot noirs cabernets and other interesting wines
9278789 i willfully admit ive got a little bit of an agenda
9278790 we are saddled with the same four letter word to describe what we do as what the big brewers do which is b e e r yet it fails to even come close
9278791 what we dont want to see is this go down the same road as wine
9278792 beer is beer no matter how expensive the bottle is or what kind of vessel it is served in
9278793 in the end it is still beer its just not the beer from 20 to 30 years ago
9278794 my response is i dont know how many wineries can we handle
9278795 terlalu rendah untuk didengar telinga manusia atau hewan tapi membikin nyamuk tak nyaman
9278796 banyak yang menyangsikan efektivitas alat ini tapi tak ada salahnya dicoba
9278797 the more the merrier as long as we can provide jobs to a lot of people not just to actors but to our production staff or crew well and good

9278805 we often read of species that are accidentally introduced into canada often with a negative impact
9278806 without natural predators the beavers have proliferated to a population now estimated at 200 000 naturally herbivorous they have taken to eating fish increasing in size and creating dams 100 metres in length
9278807 canadian beavers are now rampaging across the boreal forest into russia and displacing their european brethren
9278808 they were introduced in 1665 by king charles ii who released them into beautiful st jamess park in london
9278809 i was studying near an english castle last year and the moat was full of smelly messy canada geese who would honk so loudly it was sometimes difficult to hear the teachers
9278810 i lived in new zealand a country plagued with introduced species for a time and when a fellow discovered i was from canada he sneered slightly and said canada eh thanks for the bloody geese they were everywhere with all their predictable residue
9278811 they persist for years when all else around them breaks down to damp humus
9278812 i have started doing my laundry in cold water and have purchased a cold water detergent but it is quite a bit more expensive than other varieties what if any advantage is there to using a detergent that specifies it is for cold water
9278813 the real tehran is like a playing card you have to flip it over to see its true side
9278814 america is the first enemy the most hated enemy of iran it is the enemy of our property our lives and our religion
9278815 i live by allah minute by minute second by second
9278816 allah guides me constantly and he guides our beloved president ahmadinejad
9278817 it has the capacity to take out more ferret habitat than anything weve run up against and do it in such a short order
9278818 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9278819 were learning as we go we really dont know the answer to that yet
9278820 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9278821 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9278822 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9278823 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat
9278824 we truly believe that the als registry is revolutionary in the potential that it has to find treatments and a cure for als
9278825 sometimes there are clusters that happen because of just randomness
9278826 and then there are clusters that may happen because there is something going on there and it would be very good to understand the difference
9278827 ultimately well be publishing some kind of annual report on the incidence and prevalence of als across the state
9278828 it would definitely be a tool for us in the same way the cancer registry is a tool
9278829 when i got out of the shower my water broke the next thing i knew i was getting contractions a minute apart joe called 911 and said my girlfriend is having a baby
9278830 when i heard that the contractions were a minute apart her water had broken and this was her third child i got as many people out there as fast as i could
9278831 the baby came out perfect face down and pinked up right away
9278832 five of us were at a baseball game that evening i was picking up a pizza after the game when i got the call i dont think she ms hathaway noticed that we were in sports uniforms and that basically a baseball team showed up to deliver her baby
9278833 im another woman and wanted to be there for ms hathaway paramedics do things other people cant even imagine it can be pretty horrible and with every call you take a piece of it with you but a baby being born is the most joyful part of the job i was beaming all day long the next day
9278834 my 5 year old was traumatized that night he had a traumatic experience in january when my grandmother had a stroke while playing with him the ambulance came and took her but she never came back she passed away so when the ambulance came for me he was terrified
9278835 sometimes we have to treat the family too its part of the job

9278865 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9278866 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief

9278877 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9278878 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9278879 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9278880 bringing down the walls and the defense you find out what makes the person tick what makes them afraid then you try to amplify it to a point in which you see the actual person
9278881 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it
9278882 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9278883 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9278884 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9278885 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9278886 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9278887 its still early we still got a long way to go
9278888 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9278889 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9278890 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9278891 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9278892 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9278893 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9278894 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9278895 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9278896 comment a t il v cu ces deux derniers mois
9278897 this gets the ball rolling in the right direction for us
9278898 thats as good a defensive team as weve ever played
9278899 we grew up tonight our defense carried us and we knew theyd have to carry us early in the season until our offense gets going were getting better
9278900 we needed to win this one to get some confidence especially for some of the guys who havent played much
9278901 after everything ive got through already these early round matches it will only get better from here
9278902 im really happy to be playing well everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling
9278903 you should know that in 1980 the republicans approached me with an arms deal if i could arrange to keep the hostages in iran until after the elections
9278904 the offer to arafat was if you block the release of hostages then the white house would be open for the plo
9278905 i guess the same offer was given to others and i believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages
9278906 told me that if i do not accept this proposal they the republicans would make the same offer to my rivals
9278907 lastly he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination
9278908 were soooo horny we cant keep our clothes on much longer
9278909 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9278910 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9278911 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9278912 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9278913 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9278914 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9278915 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9278916 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning sunday
9278917 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9278918 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9278919 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9278920 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9278921 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9278922 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9278923 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9278924 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9278925 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington
9278926 we have tourists coming here all the time it would be sad to see them stop coming to places like this
9278927 you can t file bankruptcy under the new law so you d better pay up today
9278928 who has simply become a bouncer in a strip club
9278929 makes you view the entire story both volumes as one how its intended the movie uses the subject of revenge in a very original and very entertaining way as the motive and provides some great action sequences
9278930 was shot on panavision panaflex platinum cameras using primo lenses and super 35mm film
9278931 for its ability to showcase basically three varieties of visual styles in one film all contributing their own significance and doing it well in high definition
9278932 the linear pcm audio format is very realistic and definitely delivers all you need to hear in this film
9278933 3 1 2 minutes a brief fight scene between bill and a random warrior as beatrix watches form the side it does give the viewers of the film some insight as to how skilled bill was
9278934 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9278935 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9278936 it is an extremely unfortunate coincidence that the eligibility date falls on the same week and i am deeply saddened the victims have experienced this additional stress
9278937 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9278938 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9278939 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9278940 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9278941 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9278942 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9278943 were soooo horny we cant keep our clothes on much longer
9278944 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9278945 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9278946 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9278947 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9278948 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9278949 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9278950 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9278951 im standing for the greens to try and get into the political sphere because thats where the real power lies
9278952 theyre skating on thin ice in terms of their own future right now their numbers are so low theyre looking like getting a pounding
9278953 if a party whose supporters predominately give their party vote to labour says were not going to support labour they jeopardise their own support
9278954 the message for hone is there needs to be less talk and more action on his behalf
9278955 they factor that into the price of the plan so as they structure their plans they would look at how they got the capital cost of the phone over a certain time period
9278956 m lningarna ska upplevas som ett m te med en m nniska
9278957 nobodys been able to survive further inland than where we are because this is the main divide behind us
9278958 the rakaia rivers got a pretty mean reputation for having a few difficulties with vehicles but out here weve just timed it really right
9278959 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9278960 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9278961 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month

9278963 you cant get mad about anything said with smilies after it
9278964 when i had my second one i thought right ill carry out my motherly responsibilities and so i thought of doing something from home because then i could spend time with both of my children
9278965 its a very big amount for me at least because i have to think twice if i want to see something to buy my kids
9278966 these people knew you were borrowing for equipment for a franchise so i think there is a sense of moral obligation and we can ask them to assist
9278967 we received some intel that the prisoners had been drinking at stopping at a place on the way back from work and watching some videos
9278968 weve got guys who have moved on to graduate engineering weve got one person whos moved on to be a foreman and weve got one or two others that are looking at getting into other trades
9278969 there s a number of grants we re applying for
9278970 our goal is to make it better than it was before and we re on our way
9278971 my main reason for this is that i felt the four council members who voted against the proposed ordinance let us down
9278972 it really bothered me that night that they went ahead and voted they had agreed to wait until the 26th
9278973 in my opinion we have a serious problem in fremont with illegal immigrants
9278974 it gets frustrating because nothing seems to be getting done to address this
9278975 we re not willing to complain and sit and do nothing
9278976 i had a petition with me and someone asked me about it
9278977 as soon as one person signed it people kept coming
9278978 we re not prejudiced we re trying to protect the people who are here legally
9278979 the carnival was across the street and we were wondering when the ferris wheel was going to tip over
9278980 i went to the door and i saw the wind coming in one direction and the hail and tree branches started flying
9278981 the next thing you know the whole sky was dark and the wind was unbelievable i couldn t even see 2 feet out in front of our house there was hail and wind and tree branches and trees falling everywhere
9278982 the storm came so fast that they couldn t get back to our house
9278983 with that high of winds i just knew i was going to have problems
9278984 i couldn t comprehend what i was looking at in terms of downed trees and powerlines and overturned boats
9278985 the closer i got i realized that it was probably my roof
9278986 i walked around in shock and finally there were fire engines and rescue squads the road was packed with cars and rescue equipment and emergency workers
9278987 the way it sounded and with the total lack of visibility i thought there might have been a tornado on top of us
9278988 i love storms but that was about the first time i ve really been scared
9278989 everybody was sort of in awe at the debris in the streets on the houses and in the lake there were entire trees in the lake
9278990 i looked at my dock and my pontoon and shore station weren t there
9278991 i figured they probably were loose and were floating in the cove somewhere but it the boat was upside down in the shore station at my neighbor s
9278992 we knew we had to face this devastation and think about what to do
9278993 we were both so depressed and i think in shock too and we just almost hated to come back
9278994 but when we drove down county road w here was a crew working on the big cottonwood that fell on our house
9278995 they d cleared the small branches and the larger ones so we could see our house
9278996 i can t express what a psychological lift that was just to see our house and that it wasn t completely demolished in front
9278997 by sunday evening it was as if nothing happened visibly it was cleaned up and gone
9278998 these people donated many many hours of equipment and help on their own
9278999 it was people helping people in a time of crisis
9279000 we re still in the process of getting bids to do that
9279001 it was a fantastic experience that i don t ever want to go through again
9279002 the next thing you know the whole sky was dark and the wind was unbelievable i couldn t even see 2 feet out in front of our house there was hail and wind and tree branches and trees falling everywhere
9279003 we re looking at buying a more reliable phone dialer
9279004 we re in the process of getting people s e mail addresses now to be able to inform them
9279005 slide both the baking sheets into the oven and bake for 7 minutes after the 7 minutes slip the handle of a wooden spoon into the door to keep in ajar when the clairs have been in theoven for a total of 12 minutes rotate the sheets top to bottom and front to back continuebaking for a further 8 minutes or until the clairs are puffed golden and firm the total bakingtime should be approximately 20 minutes
9279006 our bedrooms were damaged in the storm so we are sleeping in the dining room
9279007 we had to do tree removal because it fell over on the fence we had to do that ourselves we had to rip out the carpeting that was wet to keep from getting mildew
9279008 we have had trouble with the insurance company and the bank
9279009 anything we ve done to this point has come out of our own pockets and we ve had to do a lot
9279010 that s a significant amount of money to take out of our savings and we did minimal things
9279011 the contractors are so busy right now because there is so much damage in the area
9279012 that will be three months before everything is back to normal
9279013 we just got the bill for august and it floored me our home isn t sealed we have the air on but it s not properly cooling the house it s costing us twice as much but it s not cooling the house like it should
9279014 we have bugs there are too many access points that aren t sealed for them when it s all said and done we re going to have to have an exterminator out
9279015 these are two expenses that the insurance company doesn t even look at
9279016 i think there s been a real spirit of community
9279017 everyone came together and helped i was amazed how many volunteer hours were put in
9279018 we lost power and thought it would be out for a few days
9279019 we had no water or sewage the pumps and lifts weren t working
9279020 if the electricity is going to be out longer than that we should be able to get a generator to use
9279021 we re looking at buying a more reliable phone dialer
9279022 we re in the process of getting people s e mail addresses now to be able to inform them
9279023 we didn t know how much we had in place with react cedar bluffs fire and nebraska emergency management
9279024 we ll get a lot more trees planted to replace them hopefully not cottonwoods
9279025 the salvation army donation the red cross donations they re all more important to many people now

9279031 that s one of the benefits of being in the united states
9279032 they can do what they feel is right do i agree with it no
9279033 if this gets on the ballot and passes it still would be litigated
9279034 people need to have a little bit of patience and let this task force do its work we will come back with some solutions
9279035 i don t think this will have an effect on what we re trying to do with the task force
9279036 i see this as totally separate the people who are going to sign this petition are going to sign the petition we re going to do what we can do with the task force we re going to see what we can do in the community that is legal
9279037 if they do get the needed signatures to get this on the ballot how can they get something on the ballot that has been determined to be illegal
9279038 they feel they were cheated out of a third hearing and they re mad
9279039 for what illegal immigration costs the people of fremont that s peanuts
9279040 i think the community should have the opportunity to vote on what they think is right that s been my stance i believe it s the citizens of fremont who should make these decisions
9279041 if it goes to a vote the majority of the people will decide my main issue is the fiscal responsibility of paying for a special election i am worried about that added expense
9279042 this is a small percentage of the population being very vocal
9279043 they re out there chasing an emotional issue with not many facts we re trying to get information to the public
9279044 they re out there chasing an emotional issue with not many facts
9279045 i wish i could wear yellow heels have pretty neat hair
9279046 it is only when i see what god is doing with the world through christ and for the glory of christ that i am able to see where i fit in the big storyline of the universe or in the little storyline of my own life the apostle pauls words to the romans are familiar passages of comfort for believers and we know that for those who love god all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose rom 8 28 this verse does not mean however simply a cheery what doesnt kill youll make you stronger hang in there instead paul says that the believers little story ultimately is a glorious one because it is part of a larger story that i may be conformed to the image of his son that he may be the firstborn among many brothers rom 8 29 how do i know that my story ends happily i only know this if i am found in christ but if i am then like all my forefathers and foremothers before me i am free from condemnation liberated from the curse triumphant over death the heir of the universe the child of god in whom he is well pleased
9279047 every time we look at the cross christ seems to say to us i am here because of you it is your sin i am bearing your curse i am suffering your debt i am paying your death i am dying nothing in history or in the universe cuts us down to size like the cross all of us have inflated views of ourselves especially in self righteousness until we have visited a place called calvary it is here at the foot of the cross that we shrink to our true size
9279048 it is by beholding the glory of christ by faith that we are spiritually edified and built up in this world for as we behold his glory the life and power of faith grow stronger and stronger
9279049 the reality is weve already set our millage rate weve already got the tax digest approved
9279050 if it doesnt come back as a rebate were a couple of million short overall
9279051 were waiting until we get some word from the state and from the governor
9279052 we have a challenge right now in our budget with revenues being low
9279053 i will unequivocally say that the downturn in the economy was not brought on by the homeowners tax relief grant i can see no scenario where i can see getting rid of it
9279054 i personally am not interested in having to pay anywhere from 250 to 350 more in property taxes
9279055 so im sure not going to vote to make anybody else have to pay that either
9279056 we made a commitment and we need to honor that commitment
9279057 is about the state spending money in many areas where it shouldnt be spending money
9279058 i know that is what the governor is putting out there but the house is for protecting that
9279059 have never approached it from the standpoint that they have to tighten their belts
9279060 i would say that the increases we have had through the years a lot of them have been attributed to state mandates
9279061 i would think that coweta county has done very well we rolled our millage rate back this year
9279062 weve tried our very best to control spending and we think we have managed it very well in a time of high growth here in the county
9279063 we had several years where it was well over 3 million in cuts from the funding formula
9279064 not only would that be a significant cut it would also come on top of those cuts that were still bearing
9279065 weve done that by an awful lot of belt tightening
9279066 we have frequently frozen spending weve maintained the minimum pupil teacher ratios but we havent had the ratios that weve wanted
9279067 we have certainly done without a great deal in the school system that parents and the community would have liked
9279068 i dont think its fair to the counties since this idea of holding it was floated so late in the game
9279069 its not something they were prepared for i think it is only fair that we keep it in place for now
9279070 and we may need to do it going forward but it does need to be looked at going forward to see if there is something else we can do to give homeowners a bit of a break on their taxes
9279071 does have some very compelling evidence that the grant is not giving anybody any tax relief which was the purpose in the first place

9279106 the job was good and the people were good and i got along with everybody it was fine

9279109 but it was nice too everywhere i went i met nice people and didnt ever have any problems the army let us do what we needed to do and we always got it done
9279110 i wanted to get back home where everybody knew me and get back to work at the funeral home
9279111 i didnt want to be fooling with that other stuff
9279112 the town was lovely and the people were good to me
9279113 the hospital was small but it had everything the bigger hospital back in columbia had so it was really nice
9279114 ill sell you a car right now if you want one

9279175 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9279176 this is just an example of colossally bad judgment of john mccain
9279177 ok im still trying to come to terms with this i wonder about the following does the mccain campaign actually think that hillary supporters will be lured to the ticket by a militant pro lifer who also believes in the teaching of intelligent design palin exploded her states coffers by imposing a windfall profits tax on the oil companies sort of no exactly like the proposal barack obama has made and john mccain has attacked apparently she also supported the bridge to nowhere despite her disclaimer at todays event so how does mccain explain putting a tax raising porker on his ticket

9279203 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9279204 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9279205 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat

9279214 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9279215 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9279216 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9279217 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9279218 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9279219 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9279220 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9279221 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9279222 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9279223 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9279224 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9279225 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9279226 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9279227 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9279228 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9279229 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9279230 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9279231 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9279232 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9279233 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9279234 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9279235 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9279236 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9279237 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9279238 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9279239 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football

9279248 this plane was barely flying with both engines on fire
9279249 the issue now is will texas southern follow its own plan
9279250 i hope it will be better this year but who knows
9279251 that says it all we have been the organization that provided the african american middle class
9279252 hopefully theyll graduate on time and texas southern wont look like the worst school in the state

9279272 sex education which is a basic right and duty of parents must always be carried out under their attentive guidance whether at home or in educational centres chosen and controlled by them in this regard the church reaffirms the law of subsidiarity which the school is bound to observe when it cooperates in sex education by entering into the same spirit that animates the parents

9279279 most wouldnt ride in the preserve but it only takes a small fraction to cause damage their impact on the land is heavy
9279280 but its virtually impossible to stop illegal trespass unless you have some place for them to go there needs to be a way to have off road uses that dont conflict with others
9279281 its the last weekend of the summer people want to make the most of it
9279282 its not worth it to sit back and hope it doesnt come
9279283 the main reason im doing it now is that i dont want to get stuck in traffic for eight hours again like last time
9279284 weve planned this so that those traveling should be able to go at speeds of 15 to 20 miles per hour instead of 5 miles per hour that has happened in the past
9279285 we will not arrest anybody that chooses not to leave but shame on them
9279286 its no fun to sit in the dark with your food rotting and no fans
9279287 were the second largest state in the country were the state with the strongest economy in the country weve been the source of presidents and the source of significant members of the congress i expect us to be treated the way weve always been treated very well
9279288 look at the presidents ratings nationally theyre under 30 percent and at the moment its oh well its the texan you know
9279289 people in our country i think do like to see a new leaf
9279290 i think that people have the image that texas is maybe too big for its britches sometimes
9279291 ive read pundits who say that my being from texas was a deterrent to be considered for vice president but of course id rather be in texas than anywhere
9279292 bush would see vindication of his iraq policy thats what his whole presidency has come down to and if that means showing up on monday and graciously bowing away and letting mccain have his moment if thats going to help him get elected i think bush will do that with no problem
9279293 going into this convention texas role is multifaceted to enthusiastically support our nominee john mccain and to showcase to the country what weve done in texas by electing good conservative leaders who continue to govern by the republican principles they campaigned on
9279294 were such attention getters we might not be front and center like we were at the last two conventions but i think that well still have a prominent role
9279295 its not mandatory but we really love to do it
9279296 im essentially asking both sides to listen to each other
9279297 many seniors are living in isolation and they may not be living on any more than social security
9279298 if theres a new proposal we need to look at it and give it to the community to get their feedback for any plan
9279299 the idea of converting magnolia glen into an assisted senior living facility is an alternative that has been brought up very recently
9279300 we would welcome the opportunity to learn more about the proposal
9279301 every property we run is either for the elderly homeless or disabled
9279302 there are too many low income people and not enough decent housing for them and if the mayor supports this idea of using magnolia glen for elderly housing or elderly disabled veterans then great weve got a compromise and a solution

9279307 the officers warned the occupants to stop and when they failed the police opened fire
9279308 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9279309 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9279310 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9279311 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9279312 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9279313 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9279314 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9279315 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9279316 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9279317 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9279318 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9279319 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9279320 id just as soon not go through it again to be honest with you
9279321 its a job where you are always second to a dog
9279322 its a testament to our offensive line a lot of times we got to the second level without being touched this is what we were looking for and its what we got today
9279323 it feels good and exciting to get back out there
9279324 i think we are headed in the right direction and this is going to be a great season for our football team
9279325 i am really pleased i think our defense is much improved from last season and they tackled really well at times today but youve got to understand that we are outweighed up front by 30 to 40 pounds in every position
9279326 it was sad and i went in there and saw him at halftime
9279327 hell probably be stronger next year and hell be in better condition if in fact he has to go through that type of rehab
9279328 can you expect that from us i dont know theres some guys that when they touch the ball and if you make a mistake they can score on you fun to watch
9279329 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations
9279330 we have a little thing coach says in practice you put the money in the bank in games you get to take it out today was payday for us i knew we were going to come out do some big stuff i just got paid today
9279331 a key for us today was getting out there and using all those weapons
9279332 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9279333 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9279334 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9279335 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9279336 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9279337 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9279338 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9279339 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9279340 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9279341 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9279342 to have the opportunity to come over here and play in a 70 000 seat nfl stadium great city where the fan base was pretty much even to play a bcs team what a great way to open the season
9279343 do i feel i played good 90 percent of the time yeah

9279347 as far as how we pitch him were missing our location on him is what were doing right now
9279348 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9279349 the other side is the best team in the national league we play everybody hard
9279350 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm
9279351 i kind of found it and started pounding the zone with all my pitches
9279352 ive already did what i am going to do in my career
9279353 even though im not walking guys my command just isnt there
9279354 im throwing plenty of strikes but the strikes just arent as quality as theyve been in the past
9279355 i think our town has gotten to experience things that few other towns in america ever get
9279356 i dont think we will become the hotspot vacation place you have to go visit
9279357 when i come here out of washington d c to a place like crawford texas im reminded of the great values of our beloved texas and the values of faith and family and friendship that you find in places like crawford
9279358 we love to come to crawford we view it as our home
9279359 i think the main thing people in crawford wanted was a grocery store
9279360 then i got a message saying they were all in baghdad
9279361 they came and ate that night but that was one of the great things you never knew what was going to happen i am going to miss all of that the people and the fun
9279362 the thing people in washington didnt understand about this place is that it can be very beautiful and especially in springtime when the wildflowers are blooming
9279363 for some of the other caterers its about the money but for me not seeing these guys here all the time is going to be strange and sad
9279364 we can make an 8 1 game as exciting as anything in the world
9279365 we do probably have to find out what we can do to be a little more consistent than we have been
9279366 weve got to come out sunday and win too we cant lose that many more games and we know that
9279367 a walkoff anything ranks high because that means your team wins the game
9279368 you load the bases and hopefully you get a groundball and give your infielders a chance to go home and maybe turn two if its hit hard enough
9279369 you just have to keep working working working and eventually its going to turn around
9279370 the best way to respond is with the bats and we did
9279371 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9279372 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9279373 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9279374 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9279375 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9279376 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9279377 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9279378 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9279379 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9279380 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9279381 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9279382 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9279383 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9279384 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9279385 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9279386 i moved when i needed to and was really happy out there
9279387 there has been a significant increase in the number of refusals about 40 percent between june 2006 and june 2008 since june 2006 there have been 10 increases in interest rates by 500 basis points resulting in mortgage repayments increasing by 43 percent
9279388 consumers disposable income has deteriorated significantly over the two year period which has resulted in an increase in the number of mortgage refusals this is attributed to the significant increase in interest rates together with the rising food and fuel prices
9279389 given this banks have had to adopt a more prudent approach to lending
9279390 we will begin to see more activity in the local residential market and some reprieve for many customers
9279391 however the 2010 soccer world cup could offset the current negative view of south africa as an investment destination and this could drive momentum in the residential property market
9279392 i didnt have much choice thankfully ive never tired of it
9279393 my family and i eat a healthy diet heavy in wild alaskan seafood moose caribou and fresh fruit
9279394 i guess my biggest pitfall is breakfast i know its the most important meal of the day but i still havent bought into it i hate to admit it but a skinny white chocolate mocha is my staple in the morning
9279395 my ideal fantasy is to be running on a hot dusty road just wearing running shorts and some kind of top that wicks away sweat but in reality im running in 20 below temperatures so i wear layers of fleece and always a good outdoor waterproof trail shoe right now ive been running in nike air structure triax and i always wear sunglasses my kids tell me to put them on so i dont freak people out when they see me with a goofy hairdo and no makeup
9279396 im thinking about my next speech i usually write my best speeches and letters in my head while out running that is my inspired time
9279397 nos termos da lei a viol ncia dom stica na sua forma mais simples considerada pequena criminalidade com uma moldura penal que vai de um a cinco anos de pris o agravada em dois a cinco anos quando praticada na presen a de menores ou na resid ncia do casal ou da v tima

9279431 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good

9279438 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9279439 thats what those cameras dont understand everyone on this bus just wants a better life no matter where we find it
9279440 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9279441 and it is warm not something im really used to

9279450 una recopilaci n de teor as de la poca de los reinos combatientes durante la cual todo el mundo se esforzaba en demostrar m s ingenio que el vecino
9279451 el arte de la guerra m s que un tratado de estrategias militares
9279452 tenemos en cuenta para la difusi n de nuestras actividades a la gente que escribe blogs porque creemos firmemente en estos nuevos canales no jerarquizados de flujo de informaci n
9279453 la motivaci n para la convocatoria a bloggers nace del inter s de tratarles como a un medio de comunicaci n m s nuevo pero medio de comunicaci n en definitiva
9279454 el criterio para enviar algo a un blog o invitarlo es que haya manifestado inter s por nuestra compa ia y por nuestra actividad tambi n analizamos la seriedad en los planteamientos que sea un blog que contrasta las informaciones y que est respaldado por personas conocedoras de las materias de las que se habla
9279455 para nosotros la blogosfera es un frente abierto pero no lo hacemos siempre y en cualquier caso es una cuesti n de an lisis de objetivos del cliente de la naturaleza del evento del contenido de masa cr tica de mbito social etc tera hacemos un c lculo ret rico y un c lculo estrat gico teniendo en cuenta las caracter sticas de cada blogger
9279456 eso es as porque no se pueden utilizar los mismos procedimientos para comunicarte con un periodista o con un m rketing de tendencias una agencia especializada en organizar eventos 2
9279457 en funci n del anuncio o del evento que tenga lugar es posible que la convocatoria de bloggers se haga por separado a la convocatoria de prensa y que el formato incluso pueda ser diferente y m s reducido o exclusivo en funci n del contenido que se vaya a transmitir no hay una f rmula nica
9279458 la comunicaci n ordinaria del banco sigue de momento por canales convencionales en el rea de innovaci n amp desarrollo s que hemos comenzado a tener en cuenta a los bloggers para comunicados eventos y convocatorias relacionados con proyectos de i d inicialmente en convocatorias separadas pero que han acabado convergiendo de manera natural
9279459 para nuestros clientes tecnol gicos solemos incluir a algunos bloggers siempre que sean de empresas y redes de blogs que publican este tipo de informaci n o que hayan dicho expresamente que les interesa recibirla no lo hacemos con todos nuestros clientes y no suelo recomendarlo a otras divisiones porque creo que primero tiene que aumentar su conocimiento sobre este campo en todo caso les digo que envien primero un correo electr nico preguntado si les interesa recibir informaci n
9279460 comenzamos a principios de a o a incluirlos en las convocatorias para p blico y en los preestrenos para medios de prensa y estamos pensando en sumarlos a las ruedas de prensa
9279461 suelen ser ellos quienes nos contactan por primera vez aunque a veces si vemos alguna afinidad les contactamos nosotros sobre todo si se trata de periodistas tradicionales que mantienen un blog
9279462 tener en cuenta a los bloggers en nuestros planes de comunicaci n no puede ser sino positivo ya que nos permite llegar a audiencias clave para nuestros clientes al fin y al cabo los bloggers se han convertido en analistas de lo que acontece en esta nueva realidad social que es internet
9279463 yo dir a que es positiva en general los mensajes clave se han difundido muy rapidamente entre el colectivo target interesado de forma espont nea aunque todav a despierta inquietud y dudas algunas caracteristicas internas al canal blog su independencia su tono informal y la posibilidad de que comentarios poco afortunados erosionen el mensaje difundido
9279464 los resultados han sido desiguales como no puede ser de otra manera porque los bloggers hacen uso de su poder y autonom a pero para nosotros es un juego muy estimulante porque nos exige una elaboraci n bastante mayor de nuestros contenidos el problema es que el cliente todav a no ha entendido esta parte del trabajo y nos cuesta much simo llevar las cosas al terreno que nosotros consideramos adecuado
9279465 de momento soy muy cauteloso advierte elliot porque no quiero llegar a un nivel de saturaci n creo que en algunos casos da buenos resultados pero no lo veo como una estrategia a largo plazo tenemos que encontrar otras maneras para darnos a conocer a trav s de redes sociales se trata sobre todo de que se establezca un canal de comunicaci n consensuado entre aquellos bloggers que quieran recibir informaci n puntual sobre una empresa y las agencias de comunicaci n que la proveen

9279474 we continue to track the path of the storm and there is no scheduling change to speak of yet
9279475 the main priority had to be making sure that everything is being done on the ground to prevent a repeat of some of the tragic situations we saw several years ago

9279526 it misses that pure important and high turban as well as the national courageous national stand and brilliant islamic mind
9279527 we miss him just as his sons and students do especially those who realized some of his dreams concerning the fight against the enemy
9279528 o resistance imam if only you were here to witness how your sons and students are accomplished the goals that you always strived to achieve and the miracle you called for
9279529 indeed they inflicted on the enemy the biggest humiliating defeat in the history of its wars against arabs and muslims
9279530 the victory you dreamt of has been achieved at the hands of the believers just as you predicted
9279531 thirtee years on imam sadrs disappearance time has come for an exceptional effort at the national arabic and islamic levels to release him and return him to his resistance and jihad field

9279539 should the situation on the border heat up once again and war erupts kassem warned that hezbollah was more prepared than ever and israel would suffer even worse casualties than before the next war will be worse than the aggressions of july the mental situation of the israelis is dejected and if the israelis come in they will suffer heavy human losses

9279566 if we did not have a system of classification that was hierarchical and had names that could be easily retrieved we would be helpless
9279567 splitters want to draw the lines around a specimen tightly while lumpers will say no thats just a slight variation and there is nothing in this system which tells you who is right it is purely subjective
9279568 if you want to preserve a vanishing species or combat a medically dangerous one or use it in some beneficial way as a crop you need to know what you are dealing with
9279569 that name is the key to all the knowledge that has been accumulated about that organism
9279570 two hundred and fifty years after linnaeus we have still only classified as few as 10 percent of the organisms living on earth
9279571 in dealing with the living world we are mostly flying blind
9279572 trying to diagnose the health of an ecosystem a lake or a forest to save or stabilise it is like a doctor treating a patient while only knowing ten percent of the organs
9279573 the registry will be the central place where everyone can go look to see what is going on in the rest of the world
9279574 tant que ce nest pas le cas notre relation avec la russie restera en observation

9279577 les plus ardents partisans de sanctions contre les russes sont ceux qui d pendent le plus de leur approvisionnement en gaz

9279589 every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man every thing we see today made by past generations was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or in impulse in the heart of a woman

9279593 i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9279594 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face
9279595 you dont defeat you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
9279596 the the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9279597 because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters
9279598 you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result

9279601 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9279602 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9279603 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9279604 she was out there with then young son track pulling him around from house to house in a wagon
9279605 shes not afraid to speak her mind she really dropped the hammer on the politicians fleecing alaska
9279606 shes an excellent social conservative fiscal conservative and political conservative
9279607 if she can energize the conservative base it wont matter if she gets the womens vote
9279608 this is a really nice person and shes disarming in that way
9279609 she did some housecleaning with her department heads she had to learn about the sewers the libraries public safety
9279610 im still leaning toward obama i think sarah has been really good for our state and it would be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9279611 if it was her running for president thered be no question in my mind
9279612 the republicans right now are about big business and big oil i dont see sarah as a staunch republican in that way

9279620 it has the potential to do damage in every part of our city
9279621 this could be the most horrific thing that ever happens in this country
9279622 i think it is a reason to take a look at what is going on at that hospital
9279623 pilgrim psychiatric center is currently experiencing challenges in the recruitment and retention of registered nurses resulting in an increased need for overtime
9279624 the lower pay and the less appealing working environment doesnt attract nurses and so you get the overtime numbers that you are looking at
9279625 my father had nothing he and my mother sold everything they had to raise 10 000
9279626 im proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me

9279635 the police have told us a million times that my brother is not a suspect
9279636 yet the last sentence of every story is the troubled son nicholas
9279637 he already bit my brother two times in the last four years once on the hand and once on the foot there were only seven people in this world allowed near that dog and he wasnt one of them
9279638 i just had to put him to sleep he was just too vicious
9279639 the really baffling problem is how to create the proper kind of public opinion

9279665 a coalition force soldier died in a non combat related incident aug 28 while conducting operations in ninewa
9279666 it was made for cable catnip obama looked at the last four years and yelled enough he promised to end the war in iraq but to do so reasonably obama prissily informed us that hes ready to have that debate about all this with all due respect no hes not
9279667 so the liberal olbermann was outraged that the aps babington had written in his analysis of the speech just off the wire that obama had tried nothing new and that his speech was lacking in specifics he read the first few paragraphs on the air lamented that it would be printed in hundred of newspapers on friday and concluded it is analysis that strikes me as having borne no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched none whatsoever and for it to be distributed by the lone national news organization in terms of wire copy to newspapers around the country and web sites is a remarkable failure of that news organization charles babington find a new line of work
9279668 sarah palin is young and telegenic and any attack on her lack of experience opens up the gop counter punch of attacking lack of experience when the he man woman haters club launches misogynistic attacks on palin and they have already begun it puts the gop in the position of supporting and defending women
9279669 well like hillary asked were you in it just for her
9279670 ive spent a lot of time over the last 24 years saying gosh i wish i werent the only one so i welcome seeing a woman on the ticket the potential for a woman to be vice president will really make a difference for girls in this country
9279671 about her efforts to clean up corruption in her home state
9279672 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9279673 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9279674 the biggest deficit in our nations history money borrowed from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis
9279675 every politician ive ever known from the major parties starts flattering the people oh how they flatter the people because thats what gives the people weak knees read the grim lesson of history here and abroad when people do not turn on to politics politics will turn on them

9279687 stephen evans and i have raced side by side for two weeks now i got to thank him for racing me clean if the fans didnt like that race im not sure what they want to see
9279688 i thought we played better competition in the game against concordia and i thought we were a little more impressive especially on the defensive end
9279689 as an assessment i think were in pretty good physical condition and i think theres a little bit better understanding compared to where we were at the end of last season as to what is required defensively im happy about that but we obviously still have work to do this concordia team has proven itself dangerous in years gone by so im happy we got through 80 minutes today and played pretty well overall
9279690 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9279691 its always great to start the year with a win
9279692 but it was a typical first game in that we had great effort but lots of penalties turnovers and mistakes that we need to correct they say the biggest improvement comes between your first and second games so lets hope thats true

9279694 a section of the road is closed and diversions are in place
9279695 all the indications from descriptions im getting are that the piers that support the bridge are settling
9279696 cracks dont appear on the superstructure of a pier for no reason the primary reason is usually subsidence an undermining of the foundation
9279697 bridges are built on piers and piers are very stable if they settle that is to say subside even millimetres cracks develop
9279698 im suspicious that the foundations to these piers have been eroded in view of the strong flow of the river in recent times
9279699 an ordinary laymans inspection of the bridge from the aston quay side reveals a considerable horizontal crack
9279700 i hope i am wrong about the crack because if im not theres a danger that one of the bridges alcoves under a heavy weight perhaps three or four buses could actually collapse
9279701 there is no structural instability on oconnell bridge and we carry out regular inspections on the bridge it is structurally sound
9279702 the water is hitting the bridge at high tide it should not be hitting the bridge it should be going under it
9279703 it looks like they are closing their eyes to global warming and flood risks
9279704 if this was the only pic of them like that i would apologize but if seen hundreds of pics that look exactley like this one

9279722 unites the gop gives conservatives a stake in the election and puts a real reformer on the ticket
9279723 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9279724 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9279725 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan

9279748 it is difficult to find albino variety when an albino variety of a tiger was found the officials did a selective breeding and built an albino lineage from it i will also try if i can make a lineage from this animal it will be a great achievement if we get rare genes of this animal in some other animal and can breed it together

9279750 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
9279751 he will be able to communicate more effectively with the leaders of our allies and the people that this is their fight too i think that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bushs administration they have been preoccupied with iraq which is not a conflict that has a lot of popular support i believe that one of the things he will bring to the challenge of bringing more resources to afghanistan is clarity of where the serious issue is it is along that afghani pakistan border this will be a priority with president obama
9279752 the british have done extraordinarily well both in afghanistan and iraq i have seen them in field i was very impressed by their professionalism as a much smaller force theyre under even greater pressure than the us military
9279753 it just wont be happening over this weekend karl is an employee of elitexc and this is labor day so i figured id give him a weekend off of public embarrassment
9279754 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9279755 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto
9279756 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9279757 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9279758 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9279759 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9279760 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up
9279761 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way

9279809 you want to kind of stop the momentum and change the momentum
9279810 im a very intense guy you know i was born and raised in puerto rico and i guess thats the way we play it has nothing to do with showing up or trying to put your opponent down
9279811 im going to have to call my mother because i guess what i said wasnt good for her i have to talk to her im a preachers son
9279812 id say today was kind of a must for us really
9279813 this late in the season we cant afford to be losing three or four games in a row we are going to lose some but at the same time weve got to hold it to a minimum

9279816 itd be nice to have him now but who could have forecast all hed go through to come back the way he did
9279817 i know him as a man that answers straight questions with straight answers
9279818 and hes been a sox fan since before he was a senator like most fans whenever i see him he wants to know if we have enough pitching
9279819 a couple months ago when he asked that question i told him pitching is like votes you can never be comfortable you have enough
9279820 they got 11 hits off me and i felt like maybe three or four were hit hard
9279821 i would say 75 percent to 80 percent this is where we are
9279822 were talking on another situation but i dont really think its going to happen
9279823 now ill have to learn a new street in philadelphia and party down there
9279824 maybe well go by rocky balboa and hang out there
9279825 if im here for a month and they want me to pinch hit every day ill do whatever it takes
9279826 its just fun to be in that atmosphere of being in the playoff race again at this point in time im playing for one thing whenever you put the uniform on from day one you want to win a world series or a stanley cup
9279827 he cant be a bullpen guy at this point we cant put him in the rotation so in fairness to him maybe the last month of the season he can hook on with another club and get an opportunity to start
9279828 for the last 45 days kris has felt really well
9279829 hes ready to go obviously he knew this was a year for the unknown from an overall recovery perspective but the most important thing is that he feels strong he feels good hes ready to pitch at the major league level

9279834 i think from the beginning of the game we went out there trying not to lose instead of trying to win
9279835 the moral of the story is that we did win the football game and even though we did not play as well as we would have liked our guys showed a lot of character on the offensive and defensive side of the ball i am very impressed with the character this team showed in tonights game

9279891 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9279892 it turns out that the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9279893 gov sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energise social conservatives
9279894 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9279895 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9279896 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9279897 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9279898 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9279899 an admirable person who will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9279900 we all know that the highest priority as a vice presidential selection is someone who can take your place
9279901 palin will have to reassure voters of her steadiness when she speaks at the republican convention and when she debates joe biden
9279902 mccain meanwhile will have to carry most of the foreign policy load himself and showcase his good health

9279911 after the season we had last year we just werent going to give up
9279912 we never got down on ourselves as a team we knew that if we got the ball with some time left we could make something happen luckily we put the ball in at the end
9279913 we had no choice but to win this game we went into spring ball preparing for this game we knew after this game we had to be 1 0
9279914 sometimes you take wins for granted we learned last year you cant do anything like that we stuck with the game plan and never gave up on each other we have really grown and know its about continuing that into our next game
9279915 mike had the complete respect of the players sold them that defense would win it and the chemistry on this team was great

9279924 i cant play anymore but the excitement of writing out the lineups doing the bp talking baseball all of that is what i do its what ive done all my life i think for a while being away from the game i had some emptiness there
9279925 somebody asked me what my name was and i told them the devil
9279926 i cant make this up theres no benefit in me telling the world that basically i was demon possessed
9279927 i remember actually slithering off the couch and you know stuff that you would pretty much see in movies

9279929 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over
9279930 i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven introduction
9279931 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
9279932 if he listens to you you will have won your brother over
9279933 if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
9279934 if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
9279935 i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
9279936 as a called servant of christ and by his authority i forgive you all your sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
9279937 i try to do the best for everybody if the best way is for me to leave ill do it
9279938 i think eventually im going to get a phone call for an interview
9279939 at the same time you look at examples elsewhere jose reyes had a history of hamstrings everybody was like he cant stay healthy move him move him move him it seems like hes been his healthiest in the big leagues
9279940 there are a ton of other guys who can never stay healthy nick johnson guys like that for every example i can give you thats good youll give me an example thats bad and ill say youre right thats the great thing on this stuff you place your bets on certain individuals and then you hope those horses finish the race first for you

9279944 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9279945 after 19 months of traversing through every state except alaska
9279946 which now that i think about it were going to have to go there now
9279947 i will end this responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9279948 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9279949 this is all being made up as we go along it is difficult to apply the old ways campaigns were run in late 20th century to this new wide open citizen led politics
9279950 unravel the ways in which the internet and web 2 0 technology are changing the way companies market themselves hint its all about relationships
9279951 is it a hurricane is it the convention or is it a blend of the two
9279952 expect to be on the first plane to the hurricane
9279953 like any good journalist theyre all eager to go down there
9279954 the approach of gustav and the is the confluence of two major news events for us and other news organizations
9279955 and of course the first the storm has the potential to be a major political event as well thus influencing the second the convention
9279956 we have a bunch of really talented journalists who can turn on a dime
9279957 i think you guys can take a look at gov
9279958 jesse chatman of the new york jets has been suspended without pay for the teams first four regular season games of 2008 for violating the nfl policy on steroids and related substances
9279959 chatmans suspension begins on saturday august 30 he is eligible to return to the jets active roster on monday september 29 following the teams september 28 game against the chatmans agent brett tessler reached last night texted the following to newsday
9279960 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9279961 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent after spending great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now jesse has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9279962 all the specific details are confidential theres not a lot i can add in terms of details im disappointed but i look forward to having him back
9279963 but at the same time i respect the program the league has in place one violation and there are consequences
9279964 my experience with jesse since hes been a jet has been extremely positive
9279965 hes done everything weve asked theres a lot of things i really like about the player and the person its something that has happened its something you never want to see but thats where we are
9279966 i was saying to myself i just might be writing my career off right now
9279967 that was the same way last year the same way the year before
9279968 i have no reason for this year saying i was retiring as opposed to the last two years nothing had changed in march the previous two years i felt the same way it could have gone either way
9279969 he told me hed like to have something before free agency and obviously before the draft and i said it makes sense but im not ready
9279970 i said right now i could care less about football
9279971 you go and ask every one of those guys who have played 10 years or longer when do they start to think about playing football again
9279972 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9279973 no im not sure but you want an answer so im giving you an answer
9279974 i dont know the day but i woke up and said hell yeah its worth it
9279975 if you were a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now
9279976 this is not bragging but i would think i would aaron might play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9279977 the bottom line was i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win
9279978 i said mike let me give you the best year i can possibly give you and lets go from there to sit here and even think about next year with whats in front of us right now is way premature
9279979 put this thing into that thing then tighten the screws after everything is all done

9279986 im sure the new facility is beautiful the guys deserve the best but theyre never going to have the feeling they had on long island
9279987 but we are very very sorry to see them leave it was a great two way relationship
9279988 i remember going there when there wasnt even a fence around the field people would bring their folding chairs or theyd just sit on a towel
9279989 its unique and its different but all four of them are guys that we like
9279990 they said there would be so much pain after surgery but i have no pain
9279991 players are always ready thats the bottom line theyre always ready
9279992 hes been through the process he feels good so im not worried
9279993 its not 100 percent because the adrenaline is not there but im excited with what i saw
9279994 when you get hurt is when you dont do that if im going to get beat im going to get beat with my best pitch
9279995 its good to be on the other side of it at the stadium
9279996 we have to play small ball against him because hes really good
9279997 if we would have done this in april or may we might have hurt some people

9279999 we have to stretch on and win these ballgames ill take the ball every day if they want me to
