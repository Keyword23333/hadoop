8370026 i think its really important to give back to your community and it makes you feel so good to get involved with a charity i look up to people who are involved with organizations that help people and animals
8370027 generally we have re established the sideways pattern in existing

8370029 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
8370030 for his contributions to electrochemistry and bioelectrochemistry which led to the development of products that have improved the quality of life of millions particularly in the area of human health and well being
8370031 for creating lithographic imaging materials and techniques that have enabled the manufacturing of smaller faster and more efficient micro electronic components
8370032 with unprecedented consistency and creativity these two engineers have spent careers continually besting their own breakthroughs
8370033 their pioneering ability to link disciplines taught a new generation of researchers the value of reaching outside of their knowledge base to solve problems it has been a great privilege of my career to witness their simultaneous contribution to research education and society
8370034 to have two winners from the same department let alone the same university is exceptional
8370035 there is no greaterexample of how devastating it can be as seen when disaster strikes and anentire community is without homes
8370036 by employing private marketprinciples and expanding accountability at all levels of the health systemwe can contain costs and improve quality of life
8370037 affordable coverage for small businesses must be at the center ofhealth care reform
8370038 we have offered a reform planthat would not only make coverage more affordable for small businesses butwould also make it easier for their employees to accept coverage when it isoffered
8370039 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8370040 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8370041 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8370042 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8370043 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8370044 even with the michael jackson task whenever hed do something you guys would go thats amazing
8370045 thats not helping dude people with disabilities they wanna be able to do it to the best of their ability they dont wanna be told that things are amazing were all on tv and we dont wanna look like s

8370057 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8370058 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8370059 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8370060 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8370061 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8370062 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8370063 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8370064 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8370065 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8370066 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8370067 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug

8370071 both of my children used to be sick all the time
8370072 after my husband died i moved in with my in laws in kachawri camp pregnant with my third child i was worried about how i would feed my baby because we could not afford bottle milk
8370073 following the advice and guidance of international medical corps health workers i have breastfed my third child since he was born
8370074 i am so thankful to international medical corps for their support and guidance
8370075 my message to all mothers is to not deprive their children of their right breastfeed them
8370076 we believe the market has come off from its peak and is likely to fall further although deliveries and earnings could continue to grow given unprecedented backlogs
8370077 we believe that these numbers and continued manufacturer optimism are evidence that despite concerns about slowing business jet orders in the u s the market still remains healthy
8370078 the timing of these motions raises serious questions as to the real motivation of these claims and we remain disappointed that nuance is resorting to these tactics to acquire zi without recognizing its full value
8370079 this renewal expresses nokias confidence in zi as a key supplier and opens the door for further opportunities to work with nokia on other projects

8370081 if were in nato we wont have to worry about nato attacking romania over our relations with our hungarian minority the way you attacked yugoslavia
8370082 since turkey has been in nato for decades you let them do what they want with the kurdish minority
8370083 if thats why you want to get into nato ill make sure you never do
8370084 whats that guy so upset about he looks the way i felt when i chaired my last judiciary committee meeting
8370085 hes got some big problem on his mind do you know what it is
8370086 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8370087 surely at such a time conception the order of nature established by god in procreation should be followed
8370088 the unborn child is from the very first a child it is still developing and has no independent life but it is a man and not a thing nor a mere part of the mothers body he who destroys germinating life kills a man
8370089 we have a romanticized view of what a stockmans life is like a man from snowy river view and i wanted to present life in a stock camp as it really is in all its grittiness
8370090 the main complaint about the book relates to the occasional use of strong language
8370091 there is in fact only a minimal amount of strong language in requiem for a beast and this is intended to reflect the language often used by australian stockmen
8370092 one only has to flick through the young adult books in bookstores to realize that the use of language in requiem for a beast is mild by comparison with many other works for older teens and adults
8370093 detractors ask if we really want to read profanity and racist dialogue in our childrens books
8370094 but this is an insidious question what can the reasonable answer be except no but this of course masks the real issue that ugliness exists that racism violence and ignorance are real and books especially fiction are still the best vehicles for exploring ideas
8370095 i am disdainful of any parents apathy in not taking 10 minutes to review a picture books appropriateness for their own children
8370096 ill deal with it when its time to get surgery

8370099 we would like to think the market could carry on somewhere
8370100 the market trades six days a week and having spoken with nearly all stallholders over the weekend they wish to continue trading
8370101 the short notice given to the stallholders gives us very limited time to find another operator
8370102 in the interim we are looking at the possibility of purchasing market stalls and operating the market ourselves

8370104 first of all its cibcs first profit in three quarters
8370105 its a lot of relief on the fact that it looks like they have written down almost everything they had to write down you can assume maybe i hope that the worst is perhaps behind cibc now and they can move on and get into a profitable business
8370106 solid gains in both overall and core new orders bode well for a return to positive growth for investment spending on equipment and software after a 3 4 per cent drop in the second quarter
8370107 as well the gain in inventories of durable goods is consistent with expectations that overall business inventories will add to gdp growth in q3

8370111 the power 9 nine rules for creating your own blue zone here they are
8370112 wow well have our own jim and pam in the white house
8370113 just as tithing reminds me that all i have is from god so sabbath keeping reminds me that god is in control
8370114 on that day i am not ann the insert various roles and titles on that day i am a disciple not a leader i am beloved simply beloved
8370115 i would make more money if i worked on sunday but i pay a personal cost for those dollars and the tradeoff isnt worth it
8370116 if we refuse rest until we are finished we will never rest until we die sabbath dissolves the artificial urgency of our days because it liberates us from the need to be finished
8370117 the truth must be told with all the money in the world and no time we have nothing at all
8370118 that is after all what they are selling in the picture people who have stopped you cannot buy stopped you simply have to stop
8370119 rest is security political stability a firm and benevolent grip on power to preserve life giving order rest is shalom god rests at the end of creation because god is able to rest
8370120 to keep sabbath is to exercise ones freedom to declare oneself to be neither a tool to be employed an employee nor a beast to be burdened
8370121 when we keep the sabbathy holy we are practicing for a day the freedom that god intends for all people
8370122 if an activity feels like something i have to do i try to do it on other days if an activity feels like something i get to do then its a candidate for the sabbath
8370123 rest on the sabbath as if all your work were done rest even from the thought of labor
8370124 sabbath is a time for useless poetry and other arts a time to appreciate a tree your neighbor and yourself without doing something to them a time to praise god as an end in itself
8370125 days pass years vanish and we walk sightless among miracles
8370126 all moments are holy moments and life itself is grace
8370127 remember recall recollect re create who god is who we are gifted sustained and blessed beyond our striving and achieving
8370128 prayer without play can degenerate into a dutiful and cheerless religion play without prayer can become mind numbing escape
8370129 celebration is more an attitude and less a bunch of activities to do
8370130 we need to dethrone the quintessentially american belief that more time equals more productivity life is not getting it all done life is not about filling every moment life is about gift embracing and receiving gods gifts god may want us to be inefficient sometimes in order for us to receive his gifts more fully
8370131 we can work without stopping faster and faster electric lights making artificial day so the whole machine can labor without ceasing but remember no living thing lives like this
8370132 i got a lot done today i justified my existence on the face of the earth
8370133 if we worry we arenot good or whole inside we will be reluctant to stop and rest afraid we will find a lurking emptiness a terrble aching void with nothing to fill it
8370134 when we cease interfering in the world we are acknowledging that it is gods world
8370135 i intended to study almost daily but i just didnt get there icant take a sabbath because i didnt work even close to six days
8370136 i dont think sunday is the right day to keep as sabbath i think each person needs to look at the rhythms of his or her week and decide what makes most sense
8370137 our familys sabbath is sundown saturday to sundown sunday it makes the change of seasons more interesting to see how sundown moves through the year
8370138 i guess that spontaneous play was my sabbath for the week
8370139 may the lord bless you today and every day of your life
8370140 keeping a sabbath doesnt guarantee serenity but failing to keep it guarantees non serenity
8370141 through the chaos of everyday life the sabbath shines like a beacon pointing straight to god reminding us that he is in control he was in control at creation he was in control at the cross and our future is in his hands
8370142 today the heart of god is an open wound of love he aches over our distance and preoccupation
8370143 holy shit what have i gotten myself into shes a psycho bitch nooooo

8370179 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
8370180 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
8370181 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
8370182 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
8370183 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects

8370186 a dynamic proxy class is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified at runtime when the class is created
8370187 studies show that where economies habitually invest in ict yields in gdp and worker productivity increase
8370188 by contrast however for those economies that invest poorly in ict their yields appear much less pronounced so the takeaway here is an ethos of continual ict investment as opposed to spotty or non investment makes for stronger more prosperous economies and peoples
8370189 among other things a yawning gap in technological skills capacity frustrates smes abilities to take advantage of ict or otherwise grow
8370190 for sme entrepreneurs to undertake and expand on new activities this obstacle needs to be addressed reduced admittedly it wont disappear overnight but in identifying and recognizing where it exists governments and industries can see areas where they can work together to develop more favorable environments for the acquisition of ict skills all of which benefits smes
8370191 strengthen the focus on personal and economic development to include an integral approach to the major issues that affect the region such as energy security personal security climate change and sustainable economic growth
8370192 economies that promote entrepreneurial activity not only benefit their local markets they also boost the welfare of the surrounding regions a goal which drives apec
8370193 innovating ict itself or innovating around ict opens a door on prosperity that brings sustainable expanding returns we hope that with the work of apec this door opens ever wider not only for apec economies but for other economies that see this as a proven model to growth and development
8370194 although companies who have been through this cycle before try to be proactive by offering bonuses or words of praise or flexible hours these measures are often not enough
8370195 during periods of economic downturn employees can feel that senior management is less than candid about the financial status of the organization and its future prospects
8370196 one of the reasons that people think about leaving a job is the perception that there is little opportunity within the company
8370197 when a slow economy reduces the challenges and excitement of the job boredom can become a real problem
8370198 farsighted companies realize that when things are slow their people have the time to devote to acquiring new skills and knowledge
8370199 one way to keep the cost down is to assign people to project or cross functional teams where they can learn from experts while doing useful work
8370200 companies that actively promote employee interaction and teamwork have less discontent and less turnover than those that keep employees apart or at odds
8370201 mentoring is not the same as coaching which is often focused on self improvement and overcoming weaknesses
8370202 mentoring is more appropriately thought of as a way to teach when employees have a real mentor they are more challenged and more likely to want to stay and continue to build the relationship
8370203 senior management must be as candid as possible even if it hurts
8370204 there is too much known information available on the internet and from analysts to cover much up if business is bad let employees know and set up ways for employees to see the ceo and other top managers in communication meetings so that they can ask their questions and vent their concerns
8370205 when these elements are present turnover is almost certain to rise even in a bad economy
8370206 but losing good employees and for some companies thats pretty much all of the remaining staff is a sad event and one that will make returning to a better economy more difficult
8370207 portability is a key capability for cloud customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their business and the only way you can change suppliers is if theres a ready market of fungible services and the only way their can be a market is if theres a high degree of standardization
8370208 this is big stuff despite the skepticism of some cloud fanatics who cant grep why

8370446 this has been a great year in itself at the college if you look back and see what we accomplished at the college with this board of trustees support the same board of trustees
8370447 that will all be forgotten very quickly we will get a good person here
8370448 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8370449 i think mr lewis had to learn a hard lesson here and that is that you have to pick your friends and be careful what you do otherwise you may end up being responsible for conduct someone else should be responsible for
8370450 its one of these things thats become prevalent in our community and the judge has to send a message our office has to send a message that when you go into that kind of situation especially with a gun that the most likely outcome is that someone is going to get seriously injured or killed
8370451 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do

8370462 i always wonder who gave you that necklace it seems like its a treasure to you
8370463 you know how i liked to go to the park and play soccer back then i met her there when i was thirteen and she was twelve we started to become friends because we both like to play soccer soon we were close friends but i dont really know much about her background and vice versa one day we wanted to buy souvenirs so we bought two necklaces one necklace has a key face and the other has a lock face and we asked the seller to engrave forever on the lock face and together on the key i chose a lock face because it looks manly
8370464 because after my sisters death i was too shocked so i shut everything out of my mind i only wanted to focus on finding out who was the culprit after that incident i stopped seeing her and moved to tokyo to study in order to become a detective
8370465 and you met me would you be back with her if you see her again
8370466 who knows she might be in love with someone else already if we are destined to be together fate will let us meet again
8370467 anyway back to work lousy girl i should charge you money for asking too many questions
8370468 yoshizawa it seems that this class isnt the type to entertain you right
8370469 can i have you solve this math problem whats 2 1
8370470 well when one person falls in love with two people since he she cant decide who to be with so he she ends up with no one having no one at the end isnt that zero
8370471 no doubt that she is hiromi chan only she and i know about this theory
8370472 i really like your theory but this is a math class not philosophy class so please dont give any meaningless answer everyone concentrate now
8370473 what the this is nothing but kidnapping you can let go of my arm you know
8370474 if it wasnt because of my duty i would have left you already
8370475 wow youre so handsome whats your name and how old are you

8370477 are you done choosing a dress and why do you need one suddenly
8370478 geez most of the stuffs she chose were pink i wonder if her panties are pink too
8370479 yossie smirked to herself she then came up with a plan she pretended to drop her key and bent down to pick it up she took peek under rikas skirt
8370480 i guess youre all talk on the outside but deep down inside youre just a pervert
8370481 alright im done with my dress now lets look a suit for you
8370482 hiromi let me help you pay half of the price
8370483 no riko gentlemen dont let girls pay and i dont like using girls money this is a gift from me to you so let me pay

8370491 she was arrested at about 10 a m and is still in custody
8370492 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8370493 problem list of banks increased 30 percent in the second quarter to the highest total in five years as more commercial real estate loans were overdue
8370494 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8370495 the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon
8370496 riskier institutions so that safer institutions wont be unduly burdened she said risky institutions should be shut down now why wait postponing the problem only makes matters worse
8370497 you are the woman that ive always dreamed of i knew it from the start i saw your face and thats the last ive seen of my heart
8370498 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
8370499 how can you tell your daughter to push my child
8370500 my daughter very politely asked your son to stop pushing her you yourself told him to stop pushing her and what does your son do not only does he push her again but he also hit her do you think your way was working
8370501 ideally you want to raise your kid to be someone who just doesnt get pushed in the first place
8370502 when youre ready to stop whining and use your words ill be ready to listen
8370503 you want to know what i teach the peanut that actions have consequences that one must always take responsibility for ones own actions
8370504 well she got what she deserved you didnt do anything about the bullying and were not going to do anything about the fight

8370525 success has been a long time coming for barry who fled sydney in 2000 after the popstars theft claims which she repeatedly denied and which cost her a chance at fame since then she has been busy trying to build a career as an actor songwriter and singer and was last year named as a quarter finalist in music nation a 15 week us online video music competition for unsigned artists

8370527 thats what we were going to ask you how should we reach out to him
8370528 laying in bed with a wall of books between them
8370529 this was apparently marion knights girlfriend that was riding with him in his car at the time she started punching him while in the car he was the driver and she was the passenger in an effort to escape she grabbed the steering wheel and steered it to the curb thats when she got out of the car and tried to run and he caught up to her
8370530 come on people even i can get a hit off this guy
8370531 hey when my pitching career comes to an end maybe i can dh
8370532 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
8370533 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8370534 honestly there is no answer it has just been one of those winters we have been locked into a nasty weather cycle that we cant shake
8370535 while its not common to have these weather cycles it does happen occasionally new zealand is exposed to storms from all directions and we can see some wild swings in rainfall from one year to the next
8370536 its looking more settled in spring and summer so hopefully theres light at the end of the tunnel
8370537 were under tremendous grounds pressure even in a good year so weve been particularly hard hit
8370538 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion
8370539 there are two directions you can go with this research
8370540 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
8370541 for typical teens in the study the probability of dropping out of high school for those who attend religious services and youth activities at least once a week is 05
8370542 for teens who never attend services the probability is 084 over 60 percent greater
8370543 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8370544 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8370545 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8370546 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else then thats where we need to be
8370547 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8370548 ive heard someone is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film i hope that happens but i hope it happens as a series of movies as one movie couldnt do it justice i really love that story and i dedicated a lot of my time to honor garths work but it wasnt meant to be

8370551 but i had a goal with the team before the season started and im sticking to it
8370552 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8370553 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8370554 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8370555 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8370556 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8370557 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8370558 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates

8370562 she is being booked at pacific division and then transferred to van nuys
8370563 after meeting with homeowners and community leaders it became clear that many applicants affected by the deadlines were elderly and low income louisianians who would be unable to comply with the program deadlines
8370564 i judge this program not by the number we have served but by the homeowners we havent yet been able help
8370565 we will focus these next months on working with individual homeowners to resolve their outstanding issues and to help them get the rebuilding dollars they desperately need
8370566 we had hoped that by offering case by case extensions we could help individual applicants in the program because of the extremely difficult issues facing our homeowners and because these extensions were not always provided on a consistent basis we determined that the fairest action to take was to give everyone affected more time
8370567 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8370568 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8370569 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8370570 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8370571 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8370572 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8370573 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8370574 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8370575 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover
8370576 es improbable que quien lo haya comprado se lo vaya a comer ya que sin duda sabr algo rancio

8370607 seit zwei oder drei jahren merken wir verst rkten zulauf
8370608 ein fahrrad ist in der stadt einfach effektiver schon allein weil die l stige parkplatzsuche wegf llt
8370609 immer mehr leute kommen mit ihren uralten fahrr dern die ich wieder fit machen soll
8370610 allein im vergangenen jahr wurden zwischen 100000 und 130000 fahrr der verkauft
8370611 die spritpreise sind ja explosionsartig gestiegen wer kann sich auto fahren heutzutage noch leisten und dann die reparaturkosten und die ewige parkplatzsuche
8370612 leute berlegen teilweise auch wirklich ob sie sich ein auto kaufen oder nicht doch lieber ein lastenrad f r 2000 euro
8370613 vor allem pendler die einen langen arbeitsweg haben kaufen sich das e bike
8370614 trotzdem k nnen wir aufgrund eigener beobachtungen schon jetzt davon ausgehen dass der wert in den vergangenen jahren auf sch tzungsweise zw lf oder 13 prozent
8370615 ein auto lohnt sich in der stadt nicht h chstens wenn man schwere gegenst nde transportieren m chte deshalb brauche ich kein auto und bin eine begeisterte radfahrerin
8370616 mit dem fahrrad bin ich in der stadt einfach schneller als mit dem auto statt viel geld f r ein auto auszugeben habe ich mir lieber ein gutes fahrrad gekauft
8370617 staus und parkplatzprobeleme hat man mit einem fahrrad nicht daher ist es einfach besser auf zwei r dern in hamburg unterwegs zu sein
8370618 fahrradfahren ist ges nder umweltfreundlicher und parken ist auch kein problem autofahrer nehmen keine r cksicht im stra enverkehr deswegen bevorzuge ich das rad
8370619 ich habe bewusst das fahrrad gew hlt auch wenn ich ein auto benutzen k nnte mit dem rad kann man in hamburg schlie lich alles gut erreichen
8370620 das autofahren ist einfach zu teuer und mit dem rad braucht man sich auch keine sorgen um parkpl tze zu machen nur leider ist hamburg nicht sehr fahrradfreundlich
8370621 vor allem leute mit langem arbeitsweg kaufen sich das e bike

8370651 der wiener hat zum tod ein sehr freundschaftliches verh ltnis
8370652 aber ich bin nat rlich auf l ngerfristige f rderung aus wir m ssen den laden erhalten sonst verliert hamburg den letzten inhabergef hrten programmclub
8370653 ich sehe die stadt weiter in der verantwortung genauso wie sie die oper oder das theater f rdert muss sich die stadt eben auch berlegen ob sie eine konzertszene erhalten will sonst besteht st pauli nur noch aus superm rkten und systemgastronomie
8370654 zu einer lebendigen musikszene geh rt auch das leben und sterben von clubs
8370655 man kann doch nicht discos in denen ein computer bestenfalls ein dj die leute unterhalten soll mit einem live musik club vergleichen
8370656 ich betreibe hier kulturarbeit mit mindestens 15 konzerten pro monat bei uns spielen nachwuchsbands die sp ter die titelseiten von zeitungen zieren
8370657 wenn es kleine clubs wie unseren nicht mehr gibt ist auch die nachwuchsf rderung dahin
8370658 davon profitiert auch die stadt denn wir ziehen leute aus aller welt an
8370659 der wahre grund sind kopfh rer f r playstation und mp3 spiele
8370660 versuch das mal einem aus new york gebuchten dj zu erkl ren
8370661 ich mag das ganze drumherum im profi fu ball nicht das war schon als spieler nicht mein ding
8370662 es geht doch in erster linie nur um kommerz da z hlen blo ergebnisse nicht die qualit t auf dem platz
8370663 deshalb sehe ich mir kein spiel mehr an h chstens ausschnitte im tv
8370664 ich habe ganz sicher nichts gegen ausl nder aber bei uns werden niemals brasilianer oder argentinier spielen die kein deutsch sprechen
8370665 wir setzen auf jungs aus der region das gehalt ist limitiert scheitern wir damit steigen wir lieber ab
8370666 ja ich habe gekniffen rwo hat nicht so ein gutes standing bei der dfl wenn uli hoene ohne klamotten rumflitzen w rde w re das wahrscheinlich nicht so schlimm
8370667 damit ist der beh rde das sch rfste schwert im kampf gegen das kraftwerk genommen
8370668 zu sp t so zukunftsf hig sind wir jungen deutschen
8370669 es w re voreilig etwas zur lage hier zu machen all diese erlebnisse brauchen zeit um anzukommen
8370670 werte berpr fen lassen deutlich gemacht was wirklich wichtig ist und viele andere probleme in den schatten gestellt
8370671 als mensch bleibt man irgendwo immer heimatlos als k nstlerin habe ich aber durch diese zwei welten viel gelernt das ist eine bereicherung
8370672 der skandal ist die faustdicke l ge des senats und nicht der vermerk dar ber

8370675 bulan coba pikir setiap hari restoran ini kira kira ada 30 customer kalau setiap customer memesan makanan sekitar 20an aja maka setiap hari restoran ini dapat duit 600 kalau sebulan bisa dapat 18 000 itu baru dihitung sangat sangat minimal belum lagi kalau ada tips belum lagi kalau pas rame belum lagi kalau bla bla bla jadi restoran ini bisa dapat bla bla bla
8370676 restoran ini seharusnya penataannya bisa lebih rapi dengan kursi yang dihadapkan ke depan bla
8370677 i get tongue tied every time i try to speak to my ears of hearing her name

8370684 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8370685 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8370686 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8370687 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8370688 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8370689 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction

8370730 the bottom line is that i never questioned their faith
8370731 that science has to be testable and proven with evidence
8370732 my whole curriculum was based on evolution i integrated it into everything i taught
8370733 now this muddies the waters and keeps students from having a really good education
8370734 when they go to college they will be at a disadvantage because they will not have a good understanding of science
8370735 the phrase academic freedom has been used by creationists for decades
8370736 do not provide students with opportunities to learn that there are differing scientific views on certain controversial issues in science
8370737 the lff believe s that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with darwins theory

8370745 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8370746 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8370747 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8370748 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8370749 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8370750 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient
8370751 a grieving widow would call and say with a broken heart and with tears in her voice pastor my husband had a heart attack last night and we took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival
8370752 jesus was the way to god or merely a way
8370753 it is a precept of my christian faith that my redemption comes through christ but i am also a big believer in the golden rule which i think is an essential pillar not only of my faith but of my values and my ideals and my experience here on earth ive said this before and i know this raises questions in the minds of some evangelicals i do not believe that my mother who never formally embraced christianity as far as i know i do not believe she went to hell
8370754 for many people today its not enough to be tolerant of other peoples decisions and religious beliefs now they want a kind of positive tolerance they want you to accept and praise other peoples beliefs you have to be willing to say what they want you to say
8370755 teach us to care and not to care teach us to sit still
8370756 i wasnt enjoying the moment because i kept thinking of ways i could improve it
8370757 theres no such thing as time only this very minute and im in it thank the lord
8370758 hang out with beings who have not transformed themselves into harbors of worry and regret and that means small children and animals
8370759 im anxious to see all of those young guys out there
8370760 sure theyll be nervous but i like watching any guy when he goes into that stadium for the first time
8370761 its fun to see their eyes in that first game
8370762 we always like in the first half of the first game to get our quarterbacks in there just so theyre not nervous anymore and all of that so im hoping we can do that
8370763 the perfect scenario for me would be to have all three of them get in the game in the first half
8370764 i think hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself and hes a perfectionist
8370765 now i know hes going to be nervous when he goes out there on saturday but he just needs to get hit a few times and then his competitive juices and focus and all will take over
8370766 theres not anything that weve been doing this summer that hes not done theres no play that people have said ok well terrelle cant do this one hes never done this one before because thats what practice is this is his chance to do it
8370767 but one thing that were asking our coaches to do regardless of position but especially for our quarterbacks is go into this game and say ok what are the five things joe bauserman does best because we want joe to be successful what are the best five things that terrelle pryor does we want him to go in and have a chance to do the things that hes really comfortable with and after all that is out of the way then we do what we have to do
8370768 i dont want to limit it to terrelle im anxious to see all those young guys because theyve come in and done a nice job but weve never seen them in a game
8370769 you will participate or there will be consequences i will leave this podium i will find you and i will kiss you

8370776 are two to three times the costs of similar programs to ratepayers in other states
8370777 as such the saw approach is a bad deal for duke ratepayers
8370778 save a watt is a radical departure from past programs and may not be embraced by all parties
8370779 previous energy efficiency programs have not demonstrated that they can achieve the savings we need in the future
8370780 duke is projecting that it will take the company 7 1 2 years until december 2015 to save 1 percent of annual electricity sales an amount that the top twenty electric utilities achieved in just one year
8370781 under the model we only get rewarded for achieving verifiable energy savings
8370782 this helps ensure that we will pursue innovative energy efficiency programs that will achieve significant savings that will help defer the need for additional power plants
8370783 i do lift weights i just aint got no muscles
8370784 in considering the sanctions to impose i have been guided by the principle that the sanctions should address and be proportional to the specific findings of research misconduct
8370785 in my judgment as purdues chief academic officer it is inappropriate for a faculty member who has been found guilty of research misconduct to hold a title of a named university professor all rights and privileges associated with the distinction including the allocation of discretionary resources are hereby withdrawn
8370786 i concur in the assessment of the investigative committee that the effects of this matter on the students and postdoctoral fellows are especially deplorable mentors of young scientists need to exhibit the highest standard of ethical behavior and collegiality
8370787 for a minimum of three years from the date of this letter your status as a member of the purdue university graduate faculty will be limited to that of special graduate faculty you will be permitted to serve on graduate committees but will not be able to serve as a major professor or co major professor for graduate students during this time
8370788 the technology i think is by and large there but its going to require some real rapid advancements to make it commercially viable
8370789 the area east of the mississippi has really got the best opportunity because you have higher summer rainfall
8370790 in the long term if we can get our breakdown process cheap enough it wouldnt make sense to use corn
8370791 at the end of the 1970s during the first oil crisis governments got interested
8370792 then it kind of fell away but i was able to get enough funding from the european union to keep my lab going
8370793 from the numbers ive done its more profitable in the long run
8370794 im thinking that were eventually going to be making our liquid fuels from biomass we cant go with corn if we used all of our corn crop in the u s it wouldnt replace our fuel and we wouldnt have anything to eat
8370795 theres a lot of hardwood forest in maine michigan the northern part of the west coast
8370796 theres enough biomass in this country to put a serious dent in gasoline
8370797 we cant really be bothered with this even though we know that when its done well its still better than pixar
8370798 i was fortunate enough to attend the 2008 first lego league championship in atlanta georgia and the energy surrounding the event was infectious
8370799 anyone can start a first lego league team but it can be confusing to navigate the rules and procedures that govern the competition i hope that this guide to fll will make it a whole lot easier for people to launch their own teams

8370810 thats the privilege of doing movies you get to drop into somebodys world i had to do it very fast my avenue in was more about the agriculture i found it fascinating
8370811 i have a ranch in montana with my brother and were raising hay in this very crude version of all that anybody whos involved with agriculture i think it takes a lot of humility and everything to make it all work they do it at such a refined level its fascinating
8370812 its amazing just the gentleness of the hills that nestle the valleys where the wineries are and the vineyards that roundly kind of lift away and up and down in these symmetrical configurations its a very very lucky corner of the world
8370813 nine years ago i thought to myself i dont really enjoy practicing law and i started writing scripts if i dont do something now its never going to happen
8370814 its a story that needs to be told and it cuts across generations and its something our generation doesnt know and its a great underdog story
8370815 maybe 40 minutes into the discussion jim barrett told me this crazy story about the wine he thumped his hands on the table and pushed his chair back and said ill tell you your movie and then he started telling me this weird story
8370816 when i was first writing it sideways had not come out yet
8370817 i said to my dad who is pretty good at judging american tastes by the way im writing this movie about wine and he said ross ill tell you i know you are really interested in it but i just dont see it
8370818 i want to show that wine is not this big stuffy hoity toity thing its fun and it tastes good
8370819 the definition of houses sir may cover mansions condominiums barns rental apartments offices lofts garages lean tos and sheds
8370820 no sir her ladyship your dear wife disapproves of sheds and will not let you put one up in the backyard
8370821 that is indeed the disappointment of my life fothergill i would love to have a shed to store my cricket equipment but further to my original question using a broader definition of houses to describe all structures with roofs how many do we own
8370822 hard to say sir like many american husbands you are totally clueless about domestic arrangements it could be that your wife has an extensive real estate portfolio that you have not bothered to inquire about
8370823 that is exactly the thing with sen mccain his wife has all these properties which the good senator does not worry about because he is too busy trying to remember who are the shiites and who are the sunnis
8370824 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition

8370853 i really like shooting and dribbling it is so exercising
8370854 when you see someone with a disability smiling laughing and enjoying the game it really motivates you

8370860 life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body
8370861 feelgood session reminding us that the physical body is finite but the human spirit is indomitable how can we cease our painful striving for more and more meaningless stuff and learn to love life ourselves and each other
8370862 i got headaches i couldnt sleep and i would vomit almost every day
8370863 i went to see a doctor and they diagnosed me with psychasthenia only then did things start to get better
8370864 we encounter a whole range of conditions in the younger generations depression anxiety and stress along with psychological problems stemming from sexual abuse dealing with hiv aids or other forms of severe trauma
8370865 psychologists in cambodia are not dealing primarily with postwar trauma anymore
8370866 for many years i didnt want other people around me i couldnt control myself
8370867 among the local population we do see many instances of psychological trauma related to family and cultural issues
8370868 often people do not know how to cope with the stresses they suffer and so they internalize it they have no outlet
8370869 most patients are women twice as many as men because women get pressure from both their families and society
8370870 some of them dont know they have a mental illness they think they have been hurt by black magic or that they have done something to offend their guardian spirit
8370871 while older generations will suppress their problems or look to spiritual means to cope the younger generations are starting to seek help when they are concerned about their psychological health
8370872 i think we can reduce the number of instances of mental health problems among cambodian people in the future if we can address some of the more serious issues in society right now
8370873 if we can reduce the poverty of those with psychological problems provide them with a job and educate them about their illness i hope we can effectively treat them
8370874 we prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace
8370875 with all leagues on any given cycle it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired
8370876 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8370877 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8370878 evidence and written submissions have been requested from each rider and a three member panel of the fei tribunal has been appointed

8370880 some white dude labor attorney in a pastel green shirt with a blue blazer and nice loafers who talks about gross revenue
8370881 simplify the message so that the players in the meetings can understand it
8370882 look im not an expert on labor issues but i understand what happens in those meetings when the union comes in and tries to explain issues to a bunch of players who dont really even want to be in the meetings
8370883 if its somebody who doesnt know how to talk their language the players tune out right away and just want to get out of there faster you hear it all the time we just had two practices im tired i just want to go home
8370884 with gene and i know plenty of people had their disagreements with him but at least whenever he was at the meetings guys would sit up because he could talk their language and he spoke with conviction look were football players most of us didnt get here because we studied labor law in college but the snot nosed 24 year old rookie who didnt pay attention most of the time paid more attention when gene spoke
8370885 with the type of money were paying for that position we should have the pick of just about anybody we would want
8370886 we have to examine this carefully i know there are a lot of ex players who want to do the job and maybe theyre the best guys but we should be looking at some big time labor attorneys too
8370887 there are a lot of complex issues coming up in the next few years we have to make sure were on top of it thats not a slap at gene its just how things are going
8370888 you want to have someone who knows what youve gone through as a player and understands the real issues when it comes to injury protection and what the team might try to do to you
8370889 you get some lawyer in front of you in the meetings and its like does this guy know what we go through
8370890 the collective bargaining agreement is about three inches thick most guys dont have the time to learn that theyre having enough issues learning the playbook so that they can make the team
8370891 it was the same way on all five teams i played for
8370892 on most teams there were maybe eight guys out of 60 something players active practice squad and injured reserve who knew more than 15 percent of the cba the four years i was in seattle nobody really cared about going to the union meetings
8370893 a lot of the time it was about voting for a veteran that the guys thought deserved the free trip
8370894 theres a lot of stuff thats going to come up in the next few years between the owners opting out a lockout a strike whatever might happen youre going to have to have someone who can communicate with the players
8370895 and the players have to really pay attention to who they put in charge
8370896 i was listening to the tv last night and they were saying that its not good for tennis if there is not a clear leader and its better to have for example henin
8370897 i dont know if i agree or not for players its different
8370898 to be player you want to see yourself or somebody else to have always a chance to be number one knowing that if you do a good job you can be there but definitely its a lot of nerves and we are all new
8370899 generations change so quick and we are all like 23 and younger justine left so everybody wants it but everybody is nervous its a bit of a funny situation but i think its interesting for everybody everybody learns so much from it
8370900 you know what i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam event and playing your best game in the first rounds
8370901 i think i want to grow every match playing better and better
8370902 today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8370903 the major league rules provide that a player who refuses to sign a uniform player contract to which he has agreed and report to the signing club shall upon a report of the signing club be placed on the restricted list until he signs a contract reflecting the terms to which he has agreed
8370904 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more to his liking we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf

8370910 heres a story about a big mistake my group made and what i learned from it
8370911 that type of work might pass for a sophomore but as a senior i could never get away with that
8370912 i have a crazy schedule and dont think id be able to meet with other students and id hate to drag them down this way i can do the project on my own time
8370913 whats the best way to approach a professor about going solo on a group project
8370914 id love to work on this group project but ive got this real world thing i think would be cooler anyway i go do this real world thing instead
8370915 hes looking to be more involved in the community in long beach
8370916 he definitely wants to look at ways that he can attract or bring businesses
8370917 i wish all our famous individuals would come back and talk about putting something back in

8370923 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8370924 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8370925 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8370926 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8370927 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8370928 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8370929 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8370930 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8370931 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8370932 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8370933 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8370934 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8370935 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8370936 this home would appraise for way over sales price but i will just have it come in at the sales price on the appraised value
8370937 this home would appraise for way over sales price but i will just have it come in at the sales price on the appraised value
8370938 to be or not to be what is your identity
8370939 im in college but really shouldnt be because there are too many temptations and im an idiot
8370940 and just a really basic question on the pershing warrants the benefit to you is a result of what specifically be
8370941 well the warrants again have a strike price of 7 the stock being under 7 results in a downward adjustment an income item if things were to go the other way it would be a obviously an expense item if things were to if the stock were to be over 7 and again this is all non cash too
8370942 and as it moves closer to or further away from 7 you take you book something there
8370943 one thing to note in this expense initiative this is something we started last year looking at and had some outside help even beginning last year looking at the fact that we really needed lower overhead and we thought there was an opportunity to do there obviously we stepped this up quite a bit in the first of the year as we saw sales softening and what was happening with the economy and brought in some additional outside help which really helped us focus on it at the beginning of the year and as we put this in in second quarter this was something that we did quite surgically with a lot of focus and literally it was a process that was not just concentrated on lets eliminate some jobs or do this et cetera which all that happened but we really literally turned over every possible stone within the company in every area and thats the reason we are so confident that we can deliver more than the 120 million in expense reductions and were still finding things
8370944 okay and then just one final separate question and ill pass it on if you can just remind me what the implications are of not selling the paperchase business within your agreement with pershing are there kind of certain levers that happen if i remember the paperchase business doesnt get sold to an outside party by the fourth quarter
8370945 no there are no implications of that and just to be clear the put that we have available that remains for our ability to put the paperchase business back to pershing square remains in effect we havent exercise the put and we obviously havent sold the paperchase business either and i would just say that as we sit here today weve got plenty of available capacity to get through the peak debt season for this year and we can sit here even without the sale of paperchase or the exercising of that put and we can say that with a high degree of confidence because that peak debt occurs early next month so we are sitting in a very comfortable position again even without the sale of paperchase as we look out through the remainder of this year and again there are no implications of not exercising that put
8370946 the pershing put was really a back stop for us to give people confidence that we had the wherewithal going forward et cetera thats why it was done it was never necessarily our intent that we would exercise it but it was there if we needed it it was a safety net so to speak since that happened i mean weve dramatically improved the financial strength of this company and the balance sheet as evidenced by the debt and our improvement in cash flow and everything that we have reported here we feel really really good about that and the expense reductions everything weve got so were just in a much much stronger position financially than we were
8370947 okay and then of the 120 million of annual savings can you break out how much of that you think comes from either store closures or business spin outs so on and so forth versus existing operational savings

8370960 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8370961 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8370962 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes

8370964 the pirates on wednesday announced that at the teams request major league baseball has placed alvarez on the restricted list because alvarezs agent scott boras informed the team that alvarez would not sign the contract and wants it renegotiated

8370973 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8370974 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8370975 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway

8371011 yes i know this is a commonly utilized and published technique that you are proposing to use as we all know however scientific papers sometimes do not really communicate the difficulty of setting up validating and deploying this method in a scientifically useful fashion i have used this technique in my lab have helped others set this up heck ive even consulted formally with people on this and oh the stories i could tell you it is not easy even if it appears to be so from the papers if you have not used this technique you are going to be mired in methods development for 2 years given the staff and time you have devoted to this project so when your timeline estimates it will take you 3 months to get this going i am thinking that there is no way that this is going to happen the kind of productivity that you describe using this technique is a pleasant fantasy but is likewise never going to happen the fact that you dont seem to recognize this possibility concerns me because it seems as though you have pulled this out of a methods section and have not really done your homework in figuring out what this technique is going to take by asking relevant peers if you do not add more people effort or expertise this project is going to end up with no publications resulting
8371012 this is my turf so get outta my yard you havent sucked up to me at enough conferences for me to consider you worthy
8371013 simply addressing your lack of expertise in those techniques you recognize you have x y and z to learn here is your plan for learning them here is why you will succeed given your experience in learning to deploy methods a b and c under similarly challenging circumstances could suffice for the next submission round

8371015 there is no evidence the pi has actually consulted with the listed expert

8371074 estuve expectante el momento del despegue pero porque todos en el avi n estaban mirando para m eh pero nada no he sentido nada en especial s que tienes un cierto por ver el tema del despegue pero nada especial
8371075 un olor a quemado horroroso y gente que gritaba pidiendo ayuda
8371076 vengo con mucha mucha alegr a porque vuelvo a mi casa y vuelvo
8371077 tambi n con mucha tristeza porque s que aqu se est n viviendo d as muy duros han fallecido muchas personas muchas familias
8371078 no s a veces siento hasta culpabilidad de venir yo de esta manera y que otros vengan de otra
8371079 me gustar a ser noticia hoy y ma ana y salir de mi casa
8371080 50 kilos 168 cm y pelo muy largo casta o claro y mechas rubias
8371081 tambi n ha desaparecido y es mucha casualidad que falten los dos
8371082 no entiendo la manera en que ten a planificada su marcha sali entre las cinco y las nueve de la ma ana va
8371083 le gusta mucho salir de fiesta con sus tres primos que son lo peor yo no le pod a prohibir que fuera con l pero creo que le ha enga ado y se ha ido con l
8371084 es una persona que hace lo que le da la gana y no trabaja
8371085 siempre me han dicho que ha sido una ni a muy buena en el colegio y que su comportamiento con profesores y compa eros ha sido muy bueno

8371090 i might be a fag but i dont like nuts in my tea
8371091 dont think about me when you vote think about the issues
8371092 barack obama lacks sufficient experience to be an effective president
8371093 there are some people who squat in this area and there was a dispute
8371094 a constellation of miniature nipples scattered over a milky way
8371095 were concerned about all of our fighters we always want to make sure theyre healthy
8371096 were confident that ken is going to pass his physical exams when anybody fights you have to make sure theyre ok to fights and thats the commissions responsibility
8371097 he got approved by florida and approved by nevada two of the top athletic commissions in the country
8371098 the only people hes lost to are legendary best in the world type fighters tito ortiz sakuraba and rich franklin and franklin couldnt even walk the next day if kimbo beats shamrock hes entering some pretty illustrious company there
8371099 he was very sick he had a viral infection a lot of people wouldnt have fought with but he didnt want to let anyone down
8371100 thats surprising to me i would never count out somebody like ken youre talking about a guy whos had only three professional fights going against somebody whos had more than 40 and beaten a lot of the best in the world i think a lot of people give shamrock a good chance of winning hes got a lot more experience than kimbo hes good on the ground and kimbo hasnt had a lot of experience on the ground
8371101 the only man i have ever known who could correct galley proofs whilst strap hanging in a busy rush hour tube
8371102 since the first nokia nseries device came to market in 2005 this range of devices has consistently represented cutting edge technology combined with an unparalleled user experience the nokia n96 builds upon this tradition to bring mobility to todays most valuable internet services with support for movies music games navigation and more right out of the box the real power of the nokia n96 is that it provides an open application environment for users to define their own mobile lifestyle
8371103 chapter 1 how i verbally bitch slapped second round draft pick martellus bennett even though he never did anything to me
8371104 im not going to be beep doing this all the beep time youve got to know what the beep to do
8371105 theres no way to differentiate patients nursing homes are all about individualizing care so if im a low risk resident and i walk by that door the alarm is going to ring every time for us though it really is important to know which resident is walking by that door and then tailor our responses to each residents needs
8371106 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
8371107 like the ill advised connection to obama in aurora thanks to dan shomon obama is mentioned in the same discusion with all these problems with giannoulias
8371108 shomons main activities are political campaigns and helping obama and his friends like alexi giannoulias who is now the treasurer for the state of illinois
8371109 we think its highly unethical of dan shomon or tom weisner to exploit the taxpayers of aurora for political purpose barack obamas credibility is also risked in the process of shomon and weisners games at the expense of taxpayers
8371110 in the 2006 democratic primary for example obama endorsed first time candidate alexi giannoulias for state treasurer despite reports about loans giannoulias family owned broadway bank made to crime figures records show giannoulias and his family had given more than 10 000 to obamas campaign which banked at broadway
8371111 much in the same way that obama was groomed for his elections by people in power in chicago and much in the same way that obama supported the corrupt stroger family even when he could have supported a reform minded liberal democrat opponent to the strogers the obama giannoulias relationship seems one of political payback
8371112 the close association of obama with a man who seems clearly to be involved in some shady deals with convicted criminals is yet another example of questionable judgment at best and typical dirty chicago politics at worst
8371113 boy would i like to be that banana right now
8371114 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my favorite movie prepare to die
8371115 mr banting was a fat man at age sixty five the five foot five banting weighted in at over two hundred pounds
8371116 banting was recently retired had no family history of obesity nor did he consider himself either lazy inactive or given to excessive indulgence at the table
8371117 nonetheless corpulence had crept up on him in his thirties as with many of us today despite his best efforts he took up daily rowing and gained muscular vigor a prodigious appetite and yet more weight
8371118 he cut back on calories which failed to induce weight loss but did leave him exhausted and beset by boils he tried walking riding horseback and manual labor his weight increased he consulted the best doctors he tried purgatives and diuretics his weight increased
8371119 luckily for banting he consulted a surgeon who had recently been to paris the doctor had just heard the great physiologist claude bernard lecture on diabetes
8371120 a diet of only meat and dairy would check the secretion of sugar in the urine of a diabetic
8371121 excessive obesity might be allied to diabetes as to its cause and if a purely animal diet were useful in the latter disease a combination of animal food with a vegetable diet that contained neither sugar nor starch might arrest the undue formation of fat
8371122 he ate three meals a day of meat fish or game usually five or six ounces at a meal with one or two stale toast or cooked fruit on the side he had his evening tea with a few more ounces of fruit or stale toast he scrupulously avoided any other food that might contain either sugar or starch in particular bread milk beer sweets and potatoes
8371123 despite a considerable allowance of alcohol in bantings regimen four or five glasses of wine each day a cordial every morning and an evening tumbler of gin whisky or brandy banting dropped thirty five pounds by the following may eight months later and fifty pounds by early the next year
8371124 i have not felt better in health than now for the last twenty six years he wrote
8371125 had entered the english language as a verb meaning to diet
8371126 gouty obese and nervous we strongly recommend him to bant
8371127 did what members of established societies often do when confronted with a radical new concept they attacked both the message and the messenger the lancet like todays newsweek first whined that bantings diet was old news second that his diet could be dangerous
8371128 facebook has been fighting mounting security threats in recent weeks we have received reports from users of spam and phishing attacks

8371131 cancer completely destroyed my family twice my husband jay died when he was 42 and our daughters were 6 and 2
8371132 three years after that my sister emily who had ironically read the eulogy at my husbands funeral was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
8371133 my life has never been the same since both of their diagnoses were incredibly bleak and devastating
8371134 my children have lived longer without their dad than they have with him
8371135 i hope enough money is raised so cancer researchers can come up with a cure
8371136 but realistically i hope that it will put cancer on the front burner and empower people to help move science along so that progress can be made

8371145 the lending of money with an exorbitant interest charge for its use
8371146 interest on all types of loans is forbidden riba there is no difference in this regard between so called consumption and production loans moreover riba is forbidden haram in small as well as large quantities whether it is effected through time deposits demand or checking deposits or any interest bearing loan contract all such dealings are among the forbidden riba
8371147 any increase or interest on a debt which has matured in return for an extension of the maturity date in case the borrower is unable to pay and the increase or interest on the loan at the inception of its agreement are both forms of usury which is prohibited under shariah
8371148 a charge for borrowed money generally a percentage of the amount borrowed
8371149 our ulema ancient and modern have worked out a great body of literature on usury based mainly on economic conditions as they existed at the rise of islam i agree with them on the main principles but respectfully differ from them on the definition of usury my definition would include profiteering of all kinds but exclude economic credit the creature of modern banking and finance
8371150 when one gives his money to another for investment and payment of a known profit this does not constitute the definitely forbidden riba regardless of the pre specified profit rate this type of transaction is beneficial both to the investor and the entrepreneur in contrast riba harms one for no fault other than being in need and benefits another for no work except greed and hardness of heart the two types of dealings cannot possibly have the same legal status hokum
8371151 investing funds with banks that pre specify profits or returns is permissible and there is no harm therein
8371152 the bank investing the money for a pre specified profit becomes a hired worker for the investors who thus accept the amount the bank gives them as their profits and all the excess profits whatever they may be are thus deemed the banks wages therefore this dealing is devoid of riba
8371153 we do not find any canonical text or convincing analogy that forbids pre specification of profits as long as there is mutual consent
8371154 so long as banks invest the money in permissible venues halal then the transaction is permissible halal the issue is an investment from money
8371155 there is no such thing as an islamic or non islamic bank so let us stop this controversy about bank interest
8371156 the ulema dont have the monopoly of interpretation of the shariah of course they must rank high in consultations on shariah issues but they dont make the religious law in the same way that its not the law professors who make the law but the parliaments
8371157 mais non prends pas celui l cest le mod le que jai eu y a trois ans en sixi me

8371166 the atrocities against kashmiris were not stopped immediately the situation within india will deteriorate for which the government of india would be solely responsible
8371167 these sacrifices would bear fruit and the day is not so far when the sun of freedom would rise over kashmir
8371168 the kashmir issue is not merely a nuisance raised by a few militants but a heartfelt freedom movement of millions of kashmiris
8371169 the hindus had cut off their food and essential supplies by blocking the supply routes to occupied kashmir
8371170 lamented the conduct of secular pakistanis who he said would probably dance and sing with the indians at the wagah border tonight while indian muslims are mercilessly being slaughtered in occupied kashmir

8371177 legislature party to meet after his exit to elect new leader
8371178 normally a clp leader who has lost majority will quit his post if mr rangasamy does not quit now he may do so on thursday
8371179 this means they have accepted the november 3 actions the day general musharraf imposed emergency as constitutional they have accepted their dismissal as valid
8371180 the whole issue is about chief justice iftikhar chaudhary they want to keep him out but the lawyers movement will go on until he is restored the lawyers will turn their grief into strength and keep the movement going pakistan cannot move ahead until iftikhar chaudhary is restored
8371181 these eight judges have been reappointed not reinstated this has set a bad precedent and it shows that the government accepts musharrafs actions as constitutional and valid
8371182 i understand you but your accent and dialect are weird
8371183 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8371184 thats nice that at least they have some fun in the drab of assembling technology
8371185 she looks about 12 or 13 to me i dont think stevo is going to be impressed at all it looks a little bit too much like child labour
8371186 there is pressure from people just looking to pay their bills later
8371187 longer terms are being given to make sales obviously thats a dangerous situation when you have the credit crisis
8371188 failing to maintain the dignity and decorum of the house and to be impartial in conducting the business
8371189 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
8371190 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
8371191 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
8371192 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
8371193 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
8371194 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
8371195 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
8371196 no hay ninguna sola irregularidad en el mbito de los asamble stas son los asesores porque el informe era sobre los asesores contratados por los asamble stas
8371197 por politiquer a no es por solvencia nosotros somos un municipio que tenemos el dinero suficiente para actuar y que precisamente es por eso que a guayaquil nadie lo doblega

8371202 yo estaba decidida en beijing pek n a retirarme pero l zambrano me habl me dijo que bamos a hacer un nuevo r gimen de entrenamiento que iban a cambiar las cosas
8371203 esto depende tambi n mucho de lo que haga el coe los presidente por federaciones porque tampoco podemos seguir sin nada necesitamos nuestras becas nuestros sueldos porque si no nos conviene tampoco podemos seguir as
8371204 yo creo que estuvo muy bien aunque esperaba un poco m s hab a entrenado mucho pero as es despu s de todo lo que pas no sub mi marca pero tampoco qued en un mal lugar
8371205 es algo muy duro para uno porque uno se prepara muy duro porque este tipo de competencia s lo se presenta cada cuatro a os hay muchas personas que dicen ay fallaste nos defraudaste pero la gente no sabe el camino que hemos hecho para llegar ah yo doy todo de m pero no se pudo m s
8371206 a m por ventaja mi mam me ense donde poner la basura yo no me voy a referir a la basura yo me refiero a las cosas objetivas que se queden donde est n nosotros no vamos a descender a esos niveles
8371207 lamentablemente a medida que pasaban los minutos el rbitro comenz a meter la mano en el partido eso hizo que en determinados minutos del primer tiempo especialmente nosotros ya comenzamos a sentir la presi n
8371208 lo vimos desde que sacaba amarilla y el penal que para nosotros y para el modo de pensar en las repeticiones que se dieron la falta no existe
8371209 creo que el equipo hizo un gran partido un gran desgaste pero bueno ellos san luis hicieron dos goles muy lindos y bueno el penal

8371229 my guess is that people have tracked these donations in all of the potential variations
8371230 were essentially providing an agency service that enables individuals to get their creative juices flowing and to put up an ad in whatever market they want at whatever budget they set
8371231 when you look at the way the law defines a pac they premise it on the existence of a quote group before the internet it wasnt hard to determine what that was
8371232 only through the internet really could you collect different individuals each sitting in front of a computer who literally will never have any meeting real or virtual other than they happen to pay for the same ad
8371233 its very difficult to believe i have won four tosses in a row
8371234 it looks a good track a bit drier than the previous ones
8371235 especially in the sub continent it is not an easy task to go for so long and be very consistent i think he and murali have done the job for us for quite some time now the younger brigade is coming through but these two have been the role models so hats off to vaasy for going on for so long 400 is a great milestone for anybody
8371236 an award could be set aside if it is contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law or to the interest of india or to justice or morality or prejudicial to the rights of the parties or if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court
8371237 it is open to the court to consider whether the award is against the specific terms of contract and if so interfere with it on the ground that it is patently illegal and opposed to public policy
8371238 if the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure it would mean that it has acted beyond its jurisdiction and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set aside under section 34 of the ac act
8371239 did you even look at your daughter when she came in did you ever see how badly shes doing shes a wreck and you dont even see that stop worrying about me start seeing whats truly going on with her she may be a damn good actress but i can see it and so could you now if youll excuse me im an athlete id have to be ashamed if i werent able to run home have a good night
8371240 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8371241 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8371242 i am not aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8371243 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8371244 no one has even come close to this i suspect no one else ever will
8371245 he soon became not just donald bradman but the don
8371246 in the tough years of the depression he was a hero at home and a great source of national pride in difficult times
8371247 he is our clark kent the mild mannered ordinary man who contains and conceals immeasurable powers is always there when needed and always delivers the goods but with nobility of purpose
8371248 something to watch not only a great batsman but a marvellous fieldsman too

8371255 i was very moved as many were by the emotion and concern about peoples heath and their future
8371256 clearly government and many observers dont get the spiritual connection first nations have with the land scientific reassurances just dont wash when they have experienced such dramatic cultural economic social and environmental change in this last decade particularly
8371257 you cant argue with smells and tastes and a way of life that has been so dramatically changed and the knowledge that science is way behind in terms of measuring impacts of long term low dose exposures to multiple chemicals
8371258 when we know that these elements going into the environment are fundamentally toxic to living systems it is imminently reasonable to ask them to stop expanding while we get some of these baseline indicators and monitoring systems set up
8371259 when were speaking with the government were speaking about everything from environmental issue that affect our business to energy supply within canada and abroad as well as capital and jobs and economic impact
8371260 when youre asking did we speak about the oil sands i think yes we would definitely have been speaking about the oil sands and our business
8371261 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
8371262 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels

8371358 no nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the united states
8371359 the policies of our country comply with our law which prohibits torture were proud of our country and what it stands for we expect all who serve america to conduct themselves with honor and we enforce the rules
8371360 the misdeeds of a few should never be used to slander the good and decent americans who go to work every day to keep our country safe
8371361 additionally we think the company is leveraged to increases in the fed funds rate given its asset sensitive balance sheet should the fed begin to tighten we believe the bank could see meaningful earnings growth driven largely by margin expansion

8371371 what we are looking for is to be able to say weve found a trough
8371372 but if thats so we can still meander around for a while so i wouldnt get too excited yet
8371373 it is an honor to be nominated by a group of americans who have served our country so well and who work hard each day to secure our future
8371374 we have all come from different places in our lives but we are united in our desire for change senator salazar has led the way in the west with a results oriented leadership style that puts people first representatives wasserman schultz and davis represent the next generation of leaders in this country who are changing the way our government helps americans michael wilson served his country in iraq and has helped advocate for change in our foreign policy
8371375 as we move forward from this convention unified and ready to elect senator obama the next president i will forever be proud of the diversity of our delegation we have delegates ranging in age from 17 to their late 80s and represent every walk of life and every corner of america i want to thank them for their support and hard work on behalf of my campaign and the democratic party
8371376 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

8371383 its our accountability that has been breached this week not the systems
8371384 its our job to fix that and thats the action plan that were putting into place
8371385 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8371386 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8371387 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8371388 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8371389 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8371390 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8371391 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8371392 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8371393 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8371394 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time
8371395 im sort of happy to be here it is one of my favourite places
8371396 the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected
8371397 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football

8371401 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8371402 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8371403 little mahal and the big search for a real mom
8371404 we prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace
8371405 with all leagues on any given cycle it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired
8371406 we filed it because we believe it is in smarts interest and the taxpayers interest to have a fair election
8371407 and the law says the arguments cannot have false statements in the ballot arguments
8371408 it is apparent the smart board thinks this may be their final chance to pass a tax to support a smart project and at this point are willing to use taxpayers dollars as a thinly veiled attempt to try to suppress the opponents arguments
8371409 the bar is high for rejecting a ballot measure by a judge
8371410 all the lawyers are saying the same thing they all say you really have to do something egregious ballot arguments are statements of what people think they have free speech in them
8371411 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing

8371413 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8371414 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8371415 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8371416 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8371417 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8371418 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8371419 i did have a crush on simon before going on the show he doesnt care about hurting peoples feelings and doesnt hold back with that he says for some reason thats so attractive

8371434 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8371435 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8371436 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8371437 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8371438 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the centre of gustav very near jamaica
8371439 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8371440 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8371441 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8371442 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8371443 whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good luckily this is not difficult
8371444 the operation in chinore is over as the third militant has been killed around 11 30 pm
8371445 this will give some confidence to the hostages inside the house that there are people still keeping watch over the militant who is holding them hostage
8371446 we would like to tire out the militant rather than storm the house
8371447 our final assault will have to wait till either the inmates have been released by the militants or we are able to rescue them
8371448 a high alert has been sounded in jammu due to the terrorist infiltration from across the border
8371449 and presented with a number of options to chose from based on
8371450 i could call myself producer line producer unit production manager and
8371451 we did this to try to protect other patients and provide a voice for the victims
8371452 i respect any jury decision but to say we are extraordinarily surprised would be a gross understatement we thought we had very good arguments
8371453 no way she said last week explaining in broken english her refusal to return to belarus
8371454 basically he said this is the only option to return and she said no her host mother debra zapata said we are backing tanya in whatever decision she wants to make there were offers and the answers were no
8371455 the taking of a life in a road rage situation such as this one is simply intolerable
8371456 had the government taken timely steps the violence could have been contained
8371457 well do our best to track down how it got there and close that gateway
8371458 this is not a frequent occurrence but we have had viruses that have made their way on board before

8371464 da die aero konfiguration in monza ganz anders ist als auf allen anderen rennstrecken haben wir heute vor allem verschiedene set ups und fl geleinstellungen f r den italien grand prix evaluiert
8371465 wir haben auch am motor gearbeitet bremsen getestet und reifen vergleichen momentan gibt es sehr wenig grip und die reifen die wir fahren sind f r die bedingungen recht hart aber dieses problem haben alle und wir werden an den n chsten tagen daran arbeiten unsere performance zu optimieren alles in allem hatten wir einen guten tag wir sind mit den gesammelten informationen zufrieden es war ein guter testauftakt
8371466 wir haben heute versucht ein gutes set up f r die restlichen testtage und das rennen in ein paar wochen zu finden und ich denke dass wir mit dem tag zufrieden sein k nnen
8371467 heute morgen gab es sehr wenig grip und es war sehr schwierig mit den reifen die wir hatten vor allem weil ich schon l nger keinen richtigen test mehr gefahren bin wir haben aber gute fortschritte gemacht sind fast 100 runden ohne probleme gefahren und sind von den zeiten her nicht weit von den anderen weg
8371468 the urge to propagandize and the inability to handle ambiguity is a hallmark of bad filmmaking regardless of the directors religious or political leaning
8371469 i can certainly think of movies that are good for the soul that offer hope and redemption with characters who do the honorable thing yet dont even mention jesus christ
8371470 all have sinned and fall short of glory of god rom 3 23
8371471 it is not true of course that all prussians would insult prisoners or slaughter children but it is true that all prussians are brought up with a wrong moral attitude towards such things and are taught to see something of magnificence in the successful tyrant rather than in the spirited slave
8371472 prussian but they were not an intrinsically evil society being born on the german polish border region is not the same as being born in mordor and it should not be implied to be such
8371473 you see this in martin luther who was quite eager to please a local prince who had done things for him so eager in fact that he privately advised the prince to take a second wife when his first became to sick for much of a sexual life contrast that with the fury luther poured out on starving peasants when they revolted those peasants poor and powerless as they were could do little for luther and hence mattered little
8371474 weve just made good strides and i want to keep them stable
8371475 they are trying to silence this guy and you cant do that
8371476 we offer a lot of afterschool interventions so we wanted to offer some afterschool enrichment for students who are doing well
8371477 this outstanding development proves that our decision to tear down clarksdale is paying dividends for the city

8371480 we will continue to collaborate with the regions service providers as well as indias governmental broadband authority to ensure that we establish the highest quality telecommunications infrastructure to deliver the most advanced services to consumers throughout the country
8371481 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8371482 anticipate at least an 80 percent shut in of the energy production region for environmental and safety purposes
8371483 hey did you read that dream book by frued confusing right wanna go get a coffee well i guess you can spike your coffee
8371484 they are some pretty astute guys theyve done fairly well and for them to come up here and take a look this is interesting
8371485 but it always surprises me frankly what gets a market going
8371486 i dont think that the buffett gates visit changes too much on the environmental concern side
8371487 but i do think it is one more data point suggesting the interest in investment in the oil sands continues to be there for many reasons that are not going to go away
8371488 it may have been an interest thing where they say well ive heard a lot about this and energy is a very important part of the world going forward no matter what i invest in i need to understand this

8371490 to take all steps in our power to protect our lands sustain our communities and assert our rights
8371491 are deeply concerned that governments are permitting development to proceed without our consent
8371492 there is going to be unified resistance to industry and government about the way they proceed with development throughout the whole region
8371493 the first nations have unified under one common goal to work hand in hand with the ngos non government organizations and the general public to move forward on the basis that water is the key element resources that sustains all life and we have no other choice but to protect the water issue and further destruction of the land that provides our well being
8371494 what it means is were going to push the fight to the government at the table and industry we would rather have them at the table during negotiations to resolve this issue we get more support from the general public if we were to do it the proper way through the proper channels
8371495 if need be if the governments and industry will not listen to us we have no other choice than revert to court action
8371496 wealth cant buy you happiness its the land that provides the services for you that provides that happiness that comes from within
8371497 it shows that people are concerned its at forums and conferences like this that speak of the issues people will come to support because theyre finding no support within the government structure right now
8371498 the aim of the report was to look at the issue of unconventional fossil fuels from an investment risk perspective
8371499 there are numerous risks such as the legislative risks posed by the requirement to reclaim the land after it has been used which will prove extremely expensive if not impossible the reputational risks associated with the toxic tailings the projects create and the damage to local rivers and wildlife and the economic risk associated with the likelihood of regulations on carbon emissions
8371500 the business model for these projects is reliant on high oil prices a continuing lack of carbon regulations and the assumption among the companies involved that governments will ultimately bail them out over the clean up costs
8371501 were calling on the oil companies to halt expansion of oil sand operations and instead invest the billions they have ploughed into these projects into renewables
8371502 were also lobbying governments to introduce legislation that will prohibit all fuels that are more carbon intensive than oil

8371504 two to three feet of sea level rise would inundate thousands of properties in low lying areas and expose millions of dollars worth of public infrastructure to the threat of submergence and or storm surge
8371505 over time state and local government will not be able to afford to assist all in need the costs will just be too high
8371506 we may well make it the capital of a future region

8371509 in our rush to develop the country we are making mistakes
8371510 we stand for preservation and modernization going hand in hand
8371511 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city
8371512 we support the development of the city in the best possible way
8371513 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali
8371514 there will be no giving up of the old towns heritage and landmarks
8371515 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8371516 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8371517 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8371518 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8371519 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8371520 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8371521 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8371522 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8371523 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8371524 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8371525 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8371526 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8371527 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8371528 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8371529 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8371530 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8371531 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8371532 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8371533 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8371534 this is a good bill that addresses many of the challenges americans face every day
8371535 americas farmers and ranchers can do many things but they cannot control the weather this is a vital provision to protect against circumstances out of their control
8371536 its important to note that more than 73 percent of the bill is for nutrition programs
8371537 as a farmer i find it appalling that anyone in this country goes to bed hungry the farm bill takes the necessary steps to ensure that this wont happen
8371538 eliminating the triple entity rule and requiring direct attribution of farm program payments will inject transparency into commodity payments
8371539 she had her faculties and she made it clear that she did not want her feeding tube removed
8371540 she could laugh and she could giggle and she could shake her head yes and no
8371541 the injunction says he raymond weber has to adhere to reasonable medical advice but he can make those decisions as long as the feeding tube and ventilator are kept in place
8371542 he was ahead of his time and he did everything himself
8371543 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
8371544 the peace ship is a project of the people we hope through this station we will help relieve the pain and heal the wounds of many years of suffering of the people of the middle east
8371545 esto es muy importante a los ni os hay que formarlos porque si no se les gu a se les puede vacunar y en lugar de ganar un lector podemos perderlo
8371546 si no los gu as correctamente si les das una lectura inapropiada para su edad y su conocimiento podemos vacunarlos en lugar de conocer el placer de la lectura van a entender que se tiene que leer por obligaci n
8371547 para empezar nuestra subgerente de editorial de obras para ni os myriam mart nez es una persona especializada
8371548 lo hemos hecho durante 74 a os y lo seguiremos haciendo y hemos encontrado estos mecanismos novedosos que queremos usarlos ahora para promover la cultura algo que normalmente no se hace en librer as
8371549 lo vamos logrando poco a poco no ha sido f cil hay mercados que han sido dif ciles de conquistar pero lo estamos logrando
8371550 es una forma de que nuestro pa s retome el liderazgo
8371551 we are gearing up to compete more with other hollywood studios and have acknowledged that a rebuilding process is going to elevate the studio to compete with our rivals
8371552 contrary to recent media reports mgm is not for sale there is no asking price for the company
8371553 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8371554 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8371555 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8371556 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8371557 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8371558 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8371559 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8371560 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8371561 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8371562 its a solid renewal plan that does come with an important number of layoffs
8371563 people knew that we were coming with a tough plan that would include tough layoffs but the good side of it is to make sure that the mill is given a competitive advantage
8371564 si se explican las normas de seguridad y se respetan no pasa nada
8371565 ahora es mucho m s f cil aprender y con mucho menos riesgo
8371566 cuando hay mucha gente es m s complicado practicar porque la distancia de seguridad con las cometas es enorme
8371567 hay mucha gente que desconoce el peligro que puede causar una cometa
8371568 si se explican las normas de seguridad y se respetan no pasa nada
8371569 para poder disfrutar con completa seguridad y sin molestar a nadie
8371570 porque hay menos gente hay olas m s viento y adem s es mucho m s bonito
8371571 si empiezas a hacer kitesurf no puedes parar cuatro o cinco meses en invierno adem s con el clima que hay en espa a
8371572 es un poco el hecho de que el viento viene cuando le da la gana por lo que cada d a puede ser el mejor de tu vida
8371573 mit marcell jansen setzen wir ebenso wie mit dem transfer von alex silva unseren weg der verpflichtungen hoch ambitionierter spieler mit gro er perspektive fort marcell hat sein internationales niveau bereits nachgewiesen und wird uns deutlich voran bringen
8371574 wir hatten uns schon vor dem wechsel zu bayern m nchen intensiv um marcell bem ht
8371575 hay algunas acciones en momentos de tensi n que pueden provocar malos entendidos
8371576 mientras el secretario de estado adjunto para asuntos del hemisferio occidental de estados unidos thomas shannon dice que respetan al presidente morales la democracia boliviana y al gobierno su embajador se re ne con un prefecto quien insulta y no quiere acatar las leyes
8371577 no ayudan a construir esas relaciones positivas que ambos gobiernos pretenden
8371578 esperamos que el embajador en adelante tenga m s cuidado en realizar acciones que puedan perjudicar la construcci n positiva de nuestras relaciones
8371579 l puede reunirse pero que trate de evitar esos encuentros en estos momentos de tensi n que pueden deteriorar las relaciones y l goldberg est muy consciente de eso y va tratar de evitar estos encuentros
8371580 yo le expliqu al canciller que fui a santa cruz por varias razones a entregar ayuda estuve en la inauguraci n de las olimp adas especiales con el prefecto y aprovech la oportunidad de esta visita tambi n para reunirme en p blico con el prefecto costas que es parte de mi labor diplom tica
8371581 the salesman told me they changed the platform to front wheel drive so itd corner better sic
8371582 bill is one of those guys who doesnt talk much but when he does he is very pointed and has a lot to say
8371583 if we want to point out how misleading they are we air the ad mccains campaign wins the point if refuse to point out how misleading they are mccains campaign escapes criticism
8371584 all obama has is a speech he gave in 2004
8371585 mccain slightly less liberal than obama but still enough of a democrat that hillary likes him
8371586 weve just opened a number of centres and weve opened them very well leased
8371587 new space is being actively looked for by quality retailers when you bring high quality space even in this environment it is actively sought after
8371588 maybe you need to buy a gift for a loved one without ruining the surprise
8371589 maybe youre at an internet kiosk and dont want the next person using it to know at which web site you bank
8371590 the most likely situation is the obvious one nudge nudge wink wink say no more
8371591 the enterprise is more concerned with keeping user information guarded from untrusted web sites than making sure your off business internet habits are kept secret
8371592 the features so far described by microsoft seem to fall more squarely into the paranoid spouse category aka what has been coined porn mode
8371593 if you happen to browse to sites that refer to the same third party resource i e a script image stylesheet information is sent to that third party
8371594 over time the third party can create a profile of which web sites you go to what links you click on etc
8371595 historically microsoft has done a good job of giving enterprise security teams a fair amount of configuration control of applications from within
8371596 essentially if written policy states that all browsing history is kept then more than likely the enterprise will be given the ability to disable the inprivate mode
8371597 searing nuanced gut wrenching loyal and deeply deeply christian speech that is the most honest speech on living in america in my adult lifetime
8371598 big fucking deal ayers didnt hurt anyone obama was on a charity board with him and there is nothing here to doubt his ability to lead this country
8371599 tyson had some gifts power movement some things he can do in the ring
8371600 she uses a lot of old school tactics and they are going to help me a lot
8371601 by that i mean they used to be so strong and in great shape you have to be strong from head to toe mind and spirit if james keeps up training hes got the power skill and determination hell do great things
8371602 it seems like theres been big opportunities to fight on certain card and they pull me off
8371603 ive been proving myself and feel i really deserve that shot to get a title but they wont give it to me and ive been put in that category of too dangerous to fight i dont blame them for being scared id be scared of me too
8371604 james kirkland is one of the most exciting fighters out there today
8371605 he will eventually get his opportunity for a title shot and when that happens he will hold those titles for a long time he has all the skills and talent to go a long way in this sport hes just that good
8371606 i know this fight on september 5th is not going to last
8371607 you cant keep up with that type of pressure speed power im left handed im a presser i know where im going with my hands im accurate and im coming
8371608 i am extremely excited to be promoting our first series of events in mexico and throughout latin america
8371609 showcasing young latin american stars on the rise in their home countries is something that i have looked forward to since golden boy promotions was founded and i am proud to partner with hbo lag on this venture
8371610 we are thrilled to team up with oscar de la hoya and golden boy promotions on our first original sports programming series
8371611 this series is an exciting addition to our sports programming lineup and reinforces hbo pluss commitment to being the only premium channel in latin america to broadcast boxing events we are very proud that latin americas next generation of champions will be groomed here on hbo plus
8371612 with this partnership hbo lag reaffirms its interest in supporting local athletes boxing is a sport with an increasing fan base and it is necessary to give young hispanic athletes the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities
8371613 globalization of the golden boy brand while showcasing top boxing talent has always been a company goal
8371614 hes a really great southern guy and when i found out what an accomplished singer he is i was delighted that he accepted my invitation
8371615 pawel is a real fighter who wanted to get right back into the ring after his first loss
8371616 hes one of the most explosive punchers around and has a very enthusiastic fan base everybody gets their moneys worth at a pawel wolak fight we also have some of the most popular entertaining fighters from the long island area on this card
8371617 there comes a time when every dog has to be put down
8371618 our plan is to leave no doubt about the outcome
8371619 we dont want it to be close on the scorecard
8371620 this time it will be almost the same but ill be a little bit quicker than the first time because i feel more comfortable at 108 pounds now
8371621 the first time it was more difficult because i was moving up from 105 i think i can put on a little more pressure and be more comfortable in this fight
8371622 he caught me with a good punch for the drop knockdown but i never felt like i was hurt and if you remember he hit me but i grabbed his waist and he kept on moving and then i touched the floor and i stood up fast i was only a little bit dizzy i was not that hurt
8371623 after that i kept on moving and surviving the round
8371624 after the eighth round i told my corner i knew i had won five or six of the first eight rounds
8371625 so i said ill give him one more round which was the ninth so that i felt better and my body felt better and then i could start putting pressure on him in the 10th 11th and 12th
8371626 hes cazares saying that in this fight hes going to be putting on pressure from the beginning from the first round but i believe if he does that hes only got six rounds to do it
8371627 after that he wont have the same legs that he had for the first six rounds and im just gonna keep on waiting and when i get my chance im gonna do almost the same thing that floyd mayweather did to oscar de la hoya oscar threw a lot of punches and missed a lot but everything mayweather threw hed connect
8371628 i dont drop people because i use a lot of movement and when you move a lot you lose a lot of power
8371629 thats why you dont see a lot of knockouts on his record but in my last fight with nelson dieppa i stood there fighting with him and i put him in bad condition twice and i showed a lot of people that i do have power in my hands
8371630 my boxing doesnt get boring to nobody because i throw a lot of punches i show a lot of movement a lot of good boxing and i dont play around in the ring i do serious stuff out there
8371631 this time ill make sure that i dont drop my hands so that the punch that got me last time doesnt get me this time
8371632 i made a commitment that i wouldnt say anything and that tomorrow there would be an announcement im not allowed to make any comments everything will be clear on thursday
8371633 last week the deal was 90 percent dead but we were able to revive it the fact that it has been so quiet is a good sign
8371634 its been a lot of back and forth and skillful negotiating and to try to get each side to soften their stance if the fight was arum vs schaefer it would have been made awhile ago
8371635 he left me the messages and at the end of one of them he said thanks for all your help i read that as the fight is done
8371636 romney fills the holes in mccains resume by his own admission mccain doesnt have a lot of knowledge about the economy but mitt romney does
8371637 i made this movie because i was inspired and empowered by my sister sen blanche lincoln
8371638 if you dont believe it just look at my hair color change
8371639 i am very grateful to be able to say thank you for what they do every day
8371640 i cant even imagine voting for sen mccain as a woman
8371641 this strengthens our existing operations in all parts of the country particularly quebec and ontario
8371642 furthermore the transaction will result in additional service capacity which provides greater stability for both our company and our clients
8371643 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8371644 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8371645 its strange that our actions to defend our citizens right on our borders should be criticised by britain considering its actions in the falkland islands which are the other side of the world
8371646 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8371647 i handed in a formal call to recognise the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8371648 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8371649 our study shows how ordinal rank has a statistically significant effect upon well being
8371650 results show that human well being depends in a particular way upon comparisons with others
8371651 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8371652 we had about 200 people behind the set a third of them were hillary people who were yelling a third of them were barack people who were yelling and a third of them were mccain people who were delighted in this yelling back and forth
8371653 to propose that eliminating all experimental aircraft from the airport would enhance its safety record is unjustified
8371654 the responsible course is to support a thorough investigation of this accident by the faa and ntsb toward the objectives of determining the actual cause and identifying any recommendations for enhancing safety
8371655 we are all dedicated to making flight operations as safe as possible but instant judgments and reactions only cloud the real issues and hinder realistic solutions
8371656 the relationships established between eaa members and congressional representatives during airventure foster the exchange of facts and information with these lawmakers about important issues
8371657 were imparting a greater understanding of the amateur building movement as a continuing source of innovation pioneering techniques and technology for the benefit of all of aviation and when we present the facts figures and trends we show that this sector of aviation continues to uphold the margins of safety expected in aviation
8371658 the source of a true smile is an awakened mind smiling helps you approach the day with gentleness and understanding
8371659 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
8371660 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
8371661 im sorry john smith in robotic monotone voice is not available right now may i take a message for john smith
8371662 la prevista situazione di stallo si quindi puntualmente verificata in una riunione con tanti assenti illustri a partire dal convalescente presidente di lega antonio matarrese ma che si chiusa rapidamente con il voto unanime di tutti i club presenti alle condizioni attuali di rai e mediaset i diritti del calcio in chiaro resteranno invenduti e quindi si potranno vedere solo gli 8 previsti dal diritto di cronaca 4 per la a e 4 per la b garantiti da immagini della lega che potranno essere mandate in onda solo nei telegiornali dalle 20
8371663 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8371664 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8371665 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8371666 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8371667 from my perspective as an artilleryman being able to hit a moving ground target is a great advantage especially with insurgents using vehicles to escape quickly once theyre identified
8371668 its a complicated weapon to employ it takes two people backing each other up and making sure the weapon is employed properly
8371669 i thought it was a really rewarding part of being history in a sense when you consider the evolution of precision guided weapons
8371670 in world war ii it took a lot of bombs to take out a target due to low accuracy if i dont have accuracy i need more bombs
8371671 now the fact that we can nearly always put one weapon against one target means we need less ordnance to destroy a target and less air power to put against a threat to achieve a desired effect
8371672 that translates to less exposure to the threat environment and a higher probability of killing targets
8371673 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8371674 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8371675 at endgame on aug 12 the team of the u s air force joint terminal attack controller alongside his ground unit commander in this event ensured all criteria were met for the first combat delivery of the ljdam and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel
8371676 around 2006 warfighters started to ask us for better capabilities against movers
8371677 boeing came up with the idea of putting the laser kit on the gbu 38 and we pitched it to the air force under an urgent operational need request
8371678 apple is not living up to some ideal of technology perfection
8371679 isn t any more likely to create technically perfect products than its competitors
8371680 look at all these great buttons that do these great things
8371681 it s an open secret that the highly touted macbook pro and leopard os will not reliably connect to wifi networks when using anything other than an apple brand airport wireless access point and even then some problems remain there have been 100s of complaints on the apple forums
8371682 the company that responds and fixes things are the ones customers will stay with
8371683 someone in a forum said vista crashed i hate vista and i hate microsoft
8371684 bring your own monitor mouse and keyboard from your pc and they all will work fine
8371685 were it not for apple constantly pushing the envelope we would all still be sitting in front of black screens with either green or amber text on them
8371686 the cost of producing ethanol varies with the cost of the feedstock used and the scale of production
8371687 because a gallon of ethanol contains less energy than a gallon of gasoline the production cost of ethanol must be multiplied by a factor of 1
8371688 the federal motor fuel excise tax on gasohol a blended fuel of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline is 5 4 cents less per gallon than the tax on straight gasoline in other words the federal subsidy is 54 cents per gallon of ethanol when the ethanol is blended with gasoline the subsidy makes ethanol blended fuel competitive in the marketplace and stimulates the growth of an ethanol production and distribution infrastructure
8371689 the usual sources of raw material for alcohol ethanol production from starch are cereal grains such as corn wheat rye barley milo sorghum grains rice etc other types of starch are available from potatoes of all kinds jerusalem artichokes and other high starch vegetables starch conversion is the standard method of production and the one we will discuss here it is possible however to make alcohol from sugar producing plants saccharine material such as sugar beets sugarcane fruits and others these substances need no milling as do grains but they do require some kind of grinding or squeezing process rapid efficient fermentation of these sugars has not been as well explored as the process using starch a third source of fermentables is cellulose as found in wood and waste sulphite liquor this more complex process requires the use of acids to reduce the material to wood sugars consequently most do it yourselfers should stick to either starch or sugar milling all grains must be ground before mashing to expose the starch granules and help them remain in suspension in a water solution the grain should be ground into a meal not a flour that will pass a 20 mesh screen on a hammermill however a 3 16

8371693 when it comes to hosted email why zig when you can zag
8371694 i think barack obama has contiunously throughout this campaign displayed his lack of knowledge and his lack of experience about foreign policy
8371695 to describe iran as a tiny country that doesnt pose any threat
8371696 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8371697 and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet
8371698 when sen mccain does it it becomes a major issue in the press
8371699 i dont think it translates necessarily into foreign policy or national security expertise
8371700 i know of nothing in his background that indicates that he has any experience in it with him or massacussetts gov mitt romney
8371701 if you run scripts that require a lot of execution time its a good idea to try to avoid letting them overload your system you can converting troff to html
8371702 nominum solves kaminsky attack and novells iprint open to attack say researchers what do these stories have in common i was the microsoft novell deal and trust in princes
8371703 ever since the open source section of the community set out to woo business in the late 1990s many involved with foss have been unsure hack week iii is almost upon us
8371704 whats hack week hack week is a chance for novells developers to work on innovation time off ito projects why does apple always seem to get a break
8371705 walking around linuxworld this year it was interesting to see the number of apple notebooks in the halls and various sessions
8371706 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
8371707 the number one presentation of the conference was ioactives dan kaminskys talk on his recent dns exploit find there was some question black hat 2008 aftermath
8371708 the ssl vpn java and activex web plug ins used by most vendors caught zusmans attention he surmised that these very powerful web browser hackers step up their efforts to exploit dns flaw
8371709 it photographs better and besides for some reason people want to type on a white typewriter dont ask me why its psychology

8371713 cum sa fac acum sa stric faza asta a adversarilor
8371714 it has been challenging but the company has risen to the challenge and responded very appropriately and very quickly
8371715 weve been able to alleviate some of the difficulties we experienced in the first half of the year
8371716 we had loved living in virginia when my husband flew off an aircraft carrier in norfolk
8371717 we visited williamsburg frequently and thought wed never live near historical accuracy again
8371718 shaves his head and portrays a shawnee leader on horseback for this event
8371719 hes part shawnee and miami and feels a close tie to those who lived in this area before the battle
8371720 its important to him that native portrayals are accurate and respectful
8371721 we all care a lot about history and want to share our love of history with enthusiasm and authenticity
8371722 his character is a revolutionary war veteran who lost his leg in battle
8371723 he shows the british musket ball to anyone who asks he also made his characters peg leg on the lathe in his shop

8371730 events like the fair at new boston become more important as schools either dilute or eliminate american history from curriculum
8371731 if children are going to learn about our heritage it will be at quality events like the fair at new boston where we work hard at accuracy and authenticity
8371732 one of the things i hear over and over again is that local people have no idea of the amazing historical events that happened right here in the miami valley
8371733 this was and is a fascinating place to live while we demonstrate the difficulties of settling in a wilderness at our event we hope that visitors will also see the joys of the lifestyles our ancestors lived and their enthusiasm for this new country
8371734 on that day i will summon my servant and give over to him your authority he shall be a father to the inhabitants and to the house i will place the key of the house of david on his shoulder i will fix him like a peg in a sure spot to be a place of honor for his family

8371762 you cannot have the incident report arrest report or 911 recordings of the homicide because its part of an investigation
8371763 well sir the public records law says a criminal investigation does not affect the standing of a public record that is unless theres a court order sealing these records
8371764 well i still have to check with xxx to get that agencys approval to give you the records
8371765 well i dont want to do anything that will jeopardize their investigation
8371766 well then they should have obtained a court order preventing me from getting these records
8371767 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8371768 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8371769 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8371770 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8371771 farmers can use these lands because of the way indians have traditionally used the land in harmony with the environment
8371772 stat ed categorically that the connecticut senator has not contacted his arizona colleague to say any such thing
8371773 these promising results exceeded our expectations zone a only represents 0 9 of our property and we are impatiently awaiting the results of the additional work currently being performed on zones a b d and e
8371774 the conclusive results are an indicator of the economic potential of our project for the gaspesie region
8371775 we are very pleased to have such a great speaker and business person talk at this years event with this line up i feel we have the red sox batting order of speakers with bill coleman as our home run hitter
8371776 for many years i have been a big supporter of chaos university and the work jims team has been doing around the advancement of project success
8371777 i am looking forward to participating in this event and laying out my vision of cloud computing and what businesses can learn from the cycles of technology innovation
8371778 it is wonderful to be part of such a distinguished team
8371779 technologies born in the consumer internet such as search wikis and social networks have changed our lives outside of work its time to take those technologies and change our world of work
8371780 this is a very aware team and making everyone aware of a common set of goals is paramount to project success
8371781 my talk will be about what techniques sapient uses to help organizations promote and focus on project awareness
8371782 the chaos university event is renowned for advancing project understanding
8371783 my contribution focuses on managing projects in uncertain times and how organizations can preserve value and keep projects viable even if they face rapid restructuring
8371784 while i will be talking about some of our new research the real stars of all chaos universities are the workshops and their participants
8371785 we have five very interesting workshops this year and some high powered delegates attending
8371786 the mere fact that the city of portland sought out and actively participated in the ongoing elections of a private condo association within the city limits to influence private property rules and regulations is itself a disconcerting action
8371787 the further fact that they used a tenuous and wrong legal foundation to do so is simply incredible
8371788 the participation of the city of portland in the voting processes of the dcha which resulted in the narrow approval of the commercial hotel project was clearly invalid
8371789 the dcha covenants are clear theres a strong question as to whether the city of portland had standing to cast its votes if the city had not cast these 23 votes the project would have died there since it only passed by a few votes
8371790 we want to be clear about one thing this is a joint effort by homeowners across the spectrum of great diamond island residents we have strong support from the cottage community as well as diamond cove homeowners that this commercial hotel development is not wanted and were prepared to fight it with this suit and other actions
8371791 we are in solidarity with all true islanders in the state when it comes to our concern about maintaining community in the face of escalating development driven by investors whose only interest in the island is financial
8371792 this is a small island and nothing happens here without impacting everyone like many others we moved to gdi for the quiet peace safety and natural beauty
8371793 it seems sacrilegious that the city of portland itself an entity that normally fights to protect unique aspects of maine history is pushing forward this hotel project in a residential historical neighborhood what youre seeing here is an island population that wants to preserve the island experience as it is now and this is our first step towards that goal
8371794 watching apcu shares trading is truly a dream come true its the epitome of the american dream
8371795 making a public market for our shares will hopefully provide early investors who believed in our company from the beginning the benefit of increasing stock value and thats very gratifying and at the end of the day it was people who made this milestone possible not banks not politicians but people who believed in us and what we were doing
8371796 controlpath grc has been the ideal enterprise risk management framework to manage the compliance requirements for each of our business units
8371797 the addition of compliance suite to trustwaves already extensive technology portfolio creates another useful tool which organizations can leverage to efficiently and effectively reach their compliance goal
8371798 this solution provides the framework and knowledgebase to enable our clients to more easily and cost effectively manage compliance efforts across multiple regulations
8371799 by automating the compliance management process this technology can support even the most complex requirements and lessen the time commitment and costs related to compliance management
8371800 as a market leader in grc technology were excited to offer this comprehensive solution to a broader global audience delivering compliance management more effectively than currently employed enterprise practices
8371801 this technology fits well with trustwaves compliance suite which currently includes solutions for a variety of regulatory mandates as the payment card industry data security standard pci dss health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and sarbanes oxley sox
8371802 island life is precious and difficult enough to preserve in an age of youtube and cell phones were talking about a community that evokes memories of mayberry rfd where neighbors wander from porch to porch and the streets in summer are full of kids drawing with chalk and riding scooters this proposed commercial hotel will threaten that
8371803 too much development and then youve got too much traffic too much burden on the fragile island environment resulting in an overtaxed ecosystem and physical infrastructure
8371804 if you ask the people who actually live at diamond cove excluding those people who own homes for the predominant purposes of renting them out for a profit i believe youll find a majority oppose the project when you ask and include those in the cottage community i would not be surprised to find that nearly 75 of homeowners on the entire island oppose the project
8371805 stronger action is needed and thats what our group is about the city is rushing this through despite the potential for multiple conflicts of interest and dubious legal positions probably because it has a huge liability on its hands
8371806 this does not add homeowners to the island homeowners who watch out for each others kids who pick up trash when they see it who try to keep the noise down so they dont upset their neighbors but large groups of people for destination weddings business events and other on island happenings for transient visitors
8371807 if they were really concerned about what the families really want on the island they would work harder at talking to them
8371808 one month ago i was surfing celebrity entertainment websites performing stand up in front of small crowds and dreaming of what it would be like on the red carpet
8371809 after all that practice and preparation its still astounding that in just a few short weeks i will be living my dream job and making connections that could change my career forever
8371810 by partnering with people com for this co branded competition we have been able to break new ground in hollywood and offer the youtube community an all access pass to one of the hottest nights in entertainment
8371811 never before has an aspiring red carpet reporter had the opportunity to sidestep the velvet rope interview hollywood stars alongside veteran people com reporters and film the experience for their youtube fans we are proud to join forces with people com to offer one red carpet reporter the chance to fulfill her lifelong goal
8371812 we couldnt have been more pleased with the level of participation and excitement we saw from the youtube and people com communities
8371813 and we are all very excited to watch franchescas star turn on the red carpet in september

8371828 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8371829 it was great to see those hillary signs come with a note that they were paid for by the obama campaign that was a nice touch on their part everything they had hoped for was delivered last night
8371830 the speech she gave last night was important the message was that it aint about us politicians we need to get to over that were conduits for the voters its got to be about real people and real life
8371831 with 75 000 supporters around you i dont care who you are youre going to be inspired

8371848 we are forced to hold our meetings trainings and seminars in our homes but the security forces have worked hard to prevent us from even holding meetings in our own homes meetings have been broken up and members have been arrested
8371849 nearly 50 were arrested and charged with vague security charges such as endangering national security or spreading of propaganda against the state
8371850 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
8371851 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
8371852 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
8371853 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
8371854 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection

8371872 distaste for narrow minded people and a penchant for shocking and insulting those around her
8371873 dr marty nemko has researched that question in an article aptly titled americas most over rated product higher education http www martynemko com articles americas most overrated product higher education id1539 the u s department of education statistics show that 76 out of 100 students who graduate in the bottom 40 percent of their high school class do not graduate from college even if they spend eight and a half years in college thats even with colleges having dumbed down classes to accommodate such students only 23 percent of the 1 3 million students who took the act college entrance examinations in 2007 were prepared to do college level study in math english and science even though a majority of students are grossly under prepared to do college level work each year colleges admit hundreds of thousands of such students
8371874 while colleges have strong financial motives to admit unsuccessful students for failing students the experience can be devastating they often leave with their families or themselves having piled up thousands of dollars in debt there is possibly trauma and poor self esteem for having failed and perhaps embarrassment for their families dr nemko says that worst of all is that few of these former college students having spent thousands of dollars wind up in a job that required a college education its not uncommon to find them driving a taxi working at a restaurant or department store performing some other job that they could have had as a high school graduate or dropout what about students who are prepared for college first only 40 percent of each years 2 million freshmen graduate in four years 45 percent never graduate at all often having a college degree does not mean much according to a 2006 pew charitable trusts study 50 percent of college seniors failed a test that required them to interpret a table about exercise and blood pressure understand the arguments of newspaper editorials and compare credit card offers about 20 percent of college seniors did not have the quantitative skills to estimate if their car had enough gas to get to the gas station according a recent national assessment of adult literacy the percentage of college graduates proficient in prose literacy has declined from 40 percent to 31 percent within the past decade employers report that many college graduates lack the basic skills of critical thinking writing and problem solving
8371875 what did you think of hills speech last night i never believe anything she says so putting that aside she seemed somewhat sincere in her support of barry we all know better but you gotta do what you gotta do this party has been too good to her for her to not support its candidate even if it isnt her i saw the video of women in the audience with tears on their face grow a pair ladies your candidate lost it happens every 4 years and the rest of the party gets behind the winner worried about hillary dont be shes either fine tuning her 2012 acceptance speech or trying on that scotus robe right now shell be just fine

8371884 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and program of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and program regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
8371885 writings expand on maududis theme of jihad against wayward muslim regimes and the infidel west and the establishment of a hegemonic shariah based political order his work has been credited as a central doctrinal source for al qaedas doctrine of jihad as well

8371902 going green used to be part of just a handful of organizations mission statements but now its become part of everyones agenda
8371903 that has of course increased the need for sustainability consultants
8371904 there have been some examples of consultants who charge a lot of money to churn paper without results
8371905 but if youre serious about sustainability third party certification like leed is part of the deal
8371906 just because leed gives a point for something doesnt mean its the right thing to do environmentally
8371907 is that the best thing to do in a hot dry climate where there is a water shortage
8371908 the requirement is 50 percent of wood has to be sustainably harvested but keep in mind if you use wheat or sunflower board or some other alternative those are grasses not wood the way the credit reads 50 percent is a lot so the more you reduce your wood the easier it is to get this credit people who just look at the scorecard and checklist wouldnt understand these nuances
8371909 in the last six months ive seen a trend away from being hired as an embedded employee in the whole process to having more of an advisory role
8371910 we do have a sustainability manager in house we didnt have that before
8371911 we will continue to use yrg for bigger more complex projects
8371912 the main task for mrs clinton at the convention reaffirming her support for mr obama in soaring and unconditional language dominated her 23 minute speech and she betrayed none of the anger and disappointment that she still feels
8371913 while mrs clinton is in the midst of a catharsis friends say mr clinton remains angrier than people realize about the obama campaigns portrayal of his wife as deceitful and of his administration as middling and his political tactics as at times racially charged friends have been urging mr clinton who speaks on wednesday night to move on and counseling the couple to focus their energy and emotions on mr mccain
8371914 at times clintons address sounded like an acceptance speech as she recalled her own historic quest for the white house and the many people she met on the campaign trail and hoped to help as president
8371915 while throwing her political weight behind her one time foe clinton said little that boosted obamas personal story political r sum nor did she defend him against gop attacks that hes unqualified for office
8371916 she said some nice words about obama in her speech yeah she was proud to support him fine but then she switched into a litany of issues shed fought for and people who had placed their faith in her
8371917 there was one big flaw in the pitch clinton never made the case that barack obama was ready to lead as commander in chief that was her strongest argument against obama during the primary so strong the mccain campaign is recycling her ad about the president answering the phone at 3 a m maybe joe biden is planning to address that issue for obama and clinton needed to stay focused on convincing her supporters still it felt like a hole
8371918 hillary said the right things nobody could accuse her of going overboard but she said the right things
8371919 it was history of a sort she showed that a woman could win the nomination but she did not win the nomination and the guy who did made some history too
8371920 she is due respect nonetheless but there is a point when a demand for respect turns into an aura of entitlement and some have been acting as if it were preordained that clinton would win the democratic nomination this year she was the candidate of inevitability after all and that somehow barack obama stole it from her
8371921 she started out a little dull and a little self obsessed
8371922 watching this convention so far i dont get the feeling that these people have lived through the same eight years as i have i may have aired more anti bush passion on this blog written by someone who endorsed the guy in 2000 than i have heard from these speakers so far unless you understand how terrible the wounds of the last eight years have been you do not understand the urgency of the obama candidacy i worry that that hasnt been put across forcefully enough so far clinton didnt do it
8371923 there may be critics for clinton there always are but she hit all her targets tuesday night even working in a joke about her pantsuits
8371924 so was it enough either to win over stubborn obama skeptics in her fan base or to stop the media from saying she isnt doing enough to try nothing will be enough to do all that but it was a start
8371925 bottom line she remains loyal democrat dissed victim the should have been nominated candidate senior healer ready to clean up the mess of 2008 and savior in 2012 note well chelseas ubiquity the slick hillary infomercial bills wide grin and the clinton triad everywhere
8371926 and the reaction of the obamanics they will belatedly seem like the baffled victims who discover their picked pockets know full well who did it but cant quite tell the police when how or by whom it happened
8371927 i believe this speech will go at least a significant way towards convincing her supporters to remain in the tent it may take a few days for that to become apparent but id expect a slow drift of hillary dead enders to return to barack obama
8371928 make sure you have room to complete a tack or a jibe without interfering with any other boats before doing so

8371952 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8371953 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work

8371967 saturn plant was not working and schools were out so traffic was not as bad

8371976 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8371977 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8371978 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8371979 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8371980 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8371987 as a kid before cable or vcrs i used to use an audio cassette recorder to tape tv shows
8371988 i did it just to get the audio tracks also there was a lot of comedy on records i would listen to monty python and older british comedy like tony hancock and the goon show
8371989 often people would describe their favorite moments on the tv shows or records

8371991 what attracted me to the character of dana was that its a funny part
8371992 he is vulnerable which was a departure from characters ive played who are unlikable i am attracted toward dysfunctional people because i find them more interesting its a challenge to play someone odd or dysfunctional and still make the audience care about them

8372063 thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings
8372064 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved

8372077 who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children
8372078 assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come down o lord let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about
8372079 and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn
8372080 and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you and ye shall be a blessing
8372081 and the armies which were in heaven clothed in fine linen white and clean followed him upon white horses

8372088 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
8372089 a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
8372090 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
8372091 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
8372092 and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
8372093 of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end
8372094 do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord
8372095 whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there
8372096 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
8372097 god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things
8372098 the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good
8372099 if god has predestined people has he chosen me to go to hell
8372100 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
8372101 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
8372102 hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
8372103 see as long as there was tension the kite flew i want you to soar too
8372104 yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man
8372105 in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god
8372106 what do you want me to learn from this lord
8372107 the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
8372108 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving
8372109 i serve a risen savior hes in the world today i know that he is living no matter what men may say
8372110 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept
8372111 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
8372112 i serve a risen savior hes in the world today i know that he is living no matter what men may say
8372113 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept
8372114 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
8372115 but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
8372116 thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
8372117 but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews
8372118 so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work
8372119 it said in the paper today that if you look at an old map early 1800s that there was a graveyard from race street to mill street all along church street who knows who those people were its sad that no record probably exists im glad that my grandparents and mom are buried in a churchyard that wont ever be just covered up and built over i hope for some reason it comforts me knowing that 200 years from now someone will be able to look at their stones and know they lived and died that they existed
8372120 shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
8372121 thats it this is what god really wants from people
8372122 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
8372123 for god so loved agape the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8372124 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
8372125 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
8372126 have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
8372127 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled
8372128 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
8372129 and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
8372130 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not
8372131 and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
8372132 joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
8372133 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
8372134 lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
8372135 the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul
8372136 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting
8372137 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever
8372138 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god s
8372139 what do i have to be thankful for all i have is trouble hardship
8372140 giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ
8372141 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high
8372142 behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him
8372143 behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine
8372144 our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield
8372145 good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
8372146 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
8372147 and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend
8372148 watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
8372149 its almost obscene that people could waste that much money on a private show
8372150 its what the industry calls stupid money its so much its impossible to refuse
8372151 i was sorry for the people who didnt have it but sometimes its good when you get thrown your bone too
8372152 football season is big here it will have an impact
8372153 its hard to tell how much but when something like this happens it just means more people will stay home and watch they wont come here
8372154 theres something about being around a bunch of badger fans who arent going to the game
8372155 people want to go out and support the hometown team
8372156 we went from three people during the game to a full house within a week of putting in the dish
8372157 it was a very big boost for our business i can say that
8372158 but well always have a big group on game day so it wont make or break us
8372159 they have an outlet now for watching the big ten network instead of a bar
8372160 when the packers were on the nfl network it was one of our best crowds
8372161 they just flocked here and weve got the nfl sunday ticket on satellite dish so we get all the fantasy football fans
8372162 i kind of saw it coming with comcast and then time warner it was only a matter of time for charter
8372163 diners with plates in hand abandoned their al fresco dining as thick black choking smoke headed towards the cookshop

8372170 longer terms are being given to make sales obviously thats a dangerous situation when you have the credit crisis
8372171 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8372172 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8372173 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8372174 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8372175 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
8372176 i know i couldnt have done what i did for the army if my wife patty hadnt taken care of everything else

8372180 this is my first time to be here everyone always tells me what a great event it is i wish i had paced myself a little better because im full and im only about half way done
8372181 my favorite thing here was the hawaiian tenderloin from coltons it was excellent
8372182 it was between the hawaiian tenderloin and lindseys barbecued ribs and lindseys fried pies were pretty good
8372183 i love dixie cafe because its good home cooking like mama used to make
8372184 what a fabulous way to get to sample all of these yummy things
8372185 were from louisiana where theres a lot of good eating and we were a little disappointed with the amount of restaurants now its catching up
8372186 we like the air conditioning some of these events that you do they have them outside folks in conway are great
8372187 i think its an awesome idea it gives everybody an idea of what we have out there
8372188 its fun it really turned out nice its nice to see all the restaurants in conway its fun to see what everybody has to bring
8372189 it seems to be going great it seems like a really great turnout
8372190 this year has been very exciting we had a great turnout great restaurants this has been an excellent opportunity for us to showcase our restaurants i think everybodys had a great time and left very full and very happy
8372191 justin is struggling right now for whatever reason the last couple of weeks
8372192 even though youve got a new coach and a new system and you missed spring drills while suspended you do expect to be the starting quarterback right
8372193 in my mind im the starter i should be the starter no doubt i put my full trust in coach jones its impossible to look at his results with quarterbacks and not trust him
8372194 in this system i wont be running as much but theres still room for me to be an athlete
8372195 the other day the light bulb really went on for me our offense should have the best of both worlds the football part is coming i just need to focus on getting to a point where coach jones and my teammates put their trust in me its going to take time ive got to remember im the one who broke that trust in the first place
8372196 im so nervous im about to pee in my pants
8372197 its nice to meet you and i apologize in advance
8372198 were putting a rock band center stage at kalita humphreys to scare the audience
8372199 weve made a very concerted effort to put together a group that will define this tommy
8372200 this is like a piece of shakespeare a piece of gershwin people have a history and connection with it this really really really is not going to be your grandmothers musical dear god in heaven not to be boring in the theater is the hardest thing better they stand up and storm out than they fall asleep we should get some rock happening on this stage

8372202 great now i know where to pick up all the day laborers
8372203 that c sar ch vez in no way meets the standard for earning a major existing dallas street name
8372204 but the definitive drama in americas minority history is not hispanic asian or even american indian it is african american there is no latino martin luther king jr no asian or indian malcolm x

8372206 i dont want smoke signals memorials or any bullshit just get it over with the sooner the better
8372207 i want to make dallas opera the best opera house in the country
8372208 theyve always had great performances and theyre one of a handful of companies that produces an opera of outstanding caliber year after year but they were held back by fair park the audience was not able to fully appreciate it because of the building
8372209 with steel you have a very courageous programmer he isnt someone who is just going to sit back and produce the standard repertoire hell find a balance between old and new the question is will he be a good fit in dallas
8372210 when brothers amp sisters came on and i saw that only half the crowd was still there i was a little confused

8372216 historic moment because we succeeded in breaching psychological barriers and this shows that its possible to make a connection between the two peoples without the interference of governments and shows that there is a partner on the other side
8372217 israel implements a policy of holding the rope at both ends allegedly the state isnt occupying gaza but it is in charge of the entrances into gaza such that it is actually operating in gaza
8372218 we are pleased that the attorney general and other government entities understood that this was a purely civil action that while illegal was only meant to promote human rights and that they decided accordingly

8372225 take microsofts own experience before it releases a new version of its windows operating system it asks staff to help debug the software by installing and running the system in the past project managers had to spend a great deal of time and effort persuading busy microsoftees to help them with this boring task so for windows vista the systems latest incarnation microsoft created a game that awarded points for bug testing and prizes such as wristbands for achieving certain goals participation quadrupled

8372230 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight
8372231 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position in fact they are passive but real allies of the haves the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wished for fantasy of the world as it should be

8372237 its a tough challenge but this is a club that thrives on challenges
8372238 the core to this club is a deep long term core we could go away from recruiting england players but we wont you want your best players on view in a premiership but the situation improves next season its a penalty but thats why you have play offs
8372239 dallaglio was the single biggest presence at the club the premiership is so competitive in france i can tell you the four semi finalists now in england eight or nine clubs could win the title
8372240 left no legacy to the english game and as a result the elite end was in a terrible state
8372241 orange is out shes hillary clinton she can wear whatever color she wants before labor day

8372251 and im sure barack obama is in montana in front of a big screen in a room with a little giraffe on the bookcase right now and baracks giving me the thumbs up
8372252 i dont know if its the orange pant suit or all this talk about astronauts but i am certainly craving a glass of tang
8372253 there she said my name again everyone take a shot
8372254 hey can you turn the sound up i think she just conceeded
8372255 before i criticize a woman i like to walk a mile in her shoes that way im a mile away and ive got her shoes
8372256 finally we all know this is second hand rose with second hand shoes
8372257 what the heck is wrong with this television i thought we were done with this lady must be some bounce back from a renegade satelitte
8372258 hey my ties to hawaii are troublesome enough if i wore that suit hillary has on theyd all accuse me of being a banana from jamaica
8372259 im not giving the speech a thumbs up im counting how many times my name was mentioned
8372260 i think youve made your points hillary now go home and go back to taking credit for things you really did not do as a senator i mean reallly
8372261 shell be in my cabinet getting me a bag of pretzels
8372262 thumbs up on hillarys end of summer beginning of fall ensemble its very hi def friendly

8372266 i knew shed do the right thing thumbs up hillary
8372267 she can wear any color she wants under a supreme court robe
8372268 i will always be grateful to everyone from all 50 states puerto rico and the territories who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the bush administration
8372269 you cant tell me that she prepared that speech practiced it 16 times and didnt notice that the district wasnt there
8372270 the last thing i imagine she meant to do is exclude the district of columbia
8372271 perhaps there was no reason to pick us out given that were obama territory
8372272 card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care
8372273 i was a pow and my wife is a beer heiress so
8372274 ive almost got little alarm bells on different parts of my body that go off when i train too much its almost ridiculous how quickly they just kick in now
8372275 because i was in the early stages of creating an attrition effect on everything it took a while and then i got to the stage where they had all worn down then all the injuries came at once now if i go too far or too hard i get reminded of it the next day by the fact that i might just have no legs or i might wake up and i am struggling with something
8372276 the unknown is the pressure what the results would mean the selections those things would be negatives to me ive turned them around and they have become positives
8372277 the first week with johnno was a good week we were re introduced into a lifestyle that supports your rugby and integrates with it to make it better
8372278 i look back at myself at ciprianis age and that was the thing i always found hardest maybe it was because i was surrounded by such high profile players that i had grown up with i thought who was i to tell these guys what to do i didnt even have my own vision of the game i was just happy to fit in to what anyone told me should be done it took me a while as the game went professional to get a grip on what i truly believed in what made me different to someone else
8372279 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8372280 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8372281 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8372282 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8372283 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8372284 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8372285 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8372286 i grew up in mansions but everything was dirty and broken
8372287 very little was going on inside except sex drugs and rock and roll
8372288 the first time i had a drink it woke up the sleeping monster inside me
8372289 maybe its to say to others this happened to me it could happen to you i dont mind being a poster girl
8372290 the borrowing of a variety of styles from different sources and combining them
8372291 we might come to the point where we might think hey this could work as a 20 minute feature but well take our cues from the audience and adjust if we feel the production costs and timing allow it
8372292 viewers do remember the network and they remember the programming it really wasnt that long ago and yes marketers and ad agencies do recall the network as well but we mainly felt that the wb had a distinct identity and connection with a certain type of viewer and a certain style of programming so it made sense to bring it back
8372293 we have a pretty wide tent in terms of the kinds of advertisers we hope to partner with
8372294 we have a clear editorial point of view with regard to the kind of programming we run whereas hulu is more of a generalist secondly its not just about the videos with us the site is as much programming as it is about the games and video mashups that users can create we sought to create a more immersive experience
8372295 this is not your ordinary pet adoption story not at all
8372296 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
8372297 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
8372298 at the beginning i was proud to say yeah im a mormon filmmaker because then i was defining what a mormon filmmaker was
8372299 it quickly got completely out of my control now no one wants to call themselves a mormon filmmaker because youre associating yourself with a genre thats fallen into disrepute its like having porn on your r sum
8372300 we expect there will be a huge response to this
8372301 things happening in somebody elses backyard might be important breakthroughs in your area
8372302 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth

8372325 men can take refuge behind a bush or a corner wall but what are we women supposed to do the only option that we have is to find a decent restaurant or a shopping store nearby and use the facility pretending to be customers

8372329 they say give us food if you have it but we dont want to board your boats all we can do is convince them to let pregnant women children and elderly or disabled people leave
8372330 where customers can call to complain about the products and services they acquire and more as a place where companies can generate revenues establish loyalty and overall strengthen their brand what a consumer thinks of a company is for the most part a reflection of their experience when they first contacted the company
8372331 companies are starting to put a lot of their customer service strategy into creating a brand that is strong that solves problems quickly and that allows their clients to be more connected to be happier this makes them stay with the brand for a longer time in the long term this will translate into more revenues
8372332 now we can bring experts from the back office we can know how to contact them via email instant messaging or cell phone we can know when theyre available when theyre not and what is their preferred method of being contacted
8372333 the reality is that none of these metrics have an impact on the big picture of the business now we are moving towards a new set of standards
8372334 you need to meet the needs of different areas within a clients organization there are three people that you need to take into consideration the call center director who wants to be able to meet his metrics better faster and more efficiently with the solutions being provided the cio wants to know the level of interoperability are the solutions ready for the future and the cfo wants to know the roi and how much the solutions are going to cost
8372335 with ip solutions pushing the unified communications platform theres also avaya that had a great year selling hybrid positions
8372336 these are some of the best practices that are translated into growth rates it doesnt necessarily translate into market share but it is a good indicator of where each company is located
8372337 autonomy etalk has an important presence in mexico and colombia nice systems had an outstanding year in panama and also argentina with three digit growth rates
8372338 but right now they are trying to position the brands by themselves establishing operations locally we will see a lot of growth in the short and medium term from them
8372339 the country is a high consumer of ip solutions any company that wants to establish strongly as an ip vendor has to succeed first in mexico there are lots of opportunities for migration and the customers are demanding these types of solutions
8372340 due to the great number of high end contact centers that are located in the country and right now they are all migrating to ip there is also great demand in this country from small and medium centers brazil will continue being the main revenue generator for the big vendors

8372411 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8372412 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary coonelly said
8372413 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted coonelly said
8372414 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system coonelly said
8372415 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8372416 we will make efforts to get vishal on remand and carry out further interrogation to know more about this racket in the currency notes

8372440 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion said paul vance the teams vice president of football operations
8372441 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous del rio said last month
8372442 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8372443 we welcome derrick and will work hard to get him up to speed as quickly as possible del rio said
8372444 i know that derrick has been anxious to get here its good for him and also for us to have this done as we finish up the preseason and prepare to start the season

8372451 leaders from punjab wanted to donate the martyrs statue to parliament but this was countered by left leaders who said they had collected funds to make the statue
8372452 lack of unanimity led to a clash among the statue lobbyists which certainly diverted attention from the crucial issue of how the statue should look when ready
8372453 it was important for the countrys parliament to recognise the sacrifice of bhagat singh
8372454 a kolkata based organisation named after bhagat singh and headed by salim had collected more than rs 1 crore for the purpose the cpi m mp said

8372462 our green papaya salad is medium spicy we cant make it mild
8372463 in the early years it was all about drinking and raging and partying out
8372464 but we shed the skin of the surf frat boy band thing
8372465 if you want to surf you have to go out to the coast and thats pretty cold and dreary
8372466 being cooped up in this weird little corner of the country youve got to find something do
8372467 youve got a lot of coffee drinking and songwriting going on
8372468 it was time to rally and bring forth the best that we really fucking had
8372469 kenny jastrow is a tremendous leader and a very special person whose positive impact on guaranty will last well beyond his tenure with the company
8372470 especially with the different personnel groups and different styles of offense and defense its constant when you match up you need personnel that can handle the people they are facing to have a chance to win its become more of a chess match and youre trying to get your best chess pieces to compete
8372471 bill walsh was a real proponent of it to the point that i remember that specifically about him
8372472 him and all the guys who came from that joe gibbs don coryell atmosphere had that attitude of were gonna get this guy on that guy in that situation i think we do that much more than we used to
8372473 dwight freeney plays right defensive end for us but sometimes if we see a right tackle we want to work on well try and get that matchup absolutely

8372508 whether people are in favor of this war or any war or against it know that people get killed and that war puts people in harms way

8372545 well have to relook at that and the question of deli meats to see if we need to go further in terms of controlling those kind of products in health care facilities
8372546 we dont think we have any cases related to this particular outbreak which is not surprising since vancouver coastal hospitals didnt serve any of the contaminated products that were initially identified
8372547 some of the larger expanded recall products had been distributed but were not so concerned about that

8372558 the election process is on in the state and we expected that there will be attempts to disrupt the process and infiltration is part of that bid but we are prepared as a nation to quell any problem that may arise
8372559 forces that are behind the disruption want to show that they exist we are taking all efforts to see that they do not get a upper hand and they will be neutralised

8372565 unless and until it is proved who has done it acting against some section of society is wrong
8372566 i have extended support to shibu soren no one is above the upa united progressive alliance
8372567 if workers are deprived by owners they cannot take law in their own hands strike is a weapon to fulfil their demands

8372573 i requested the pm to give the state a relief package of rs 1 000 crore and one lakh tonnes of foodgrain preferably rice to be distributed among the flood victims
8372574 people in the worst affected areas need to be evacauted early the evacuated people may have to be kept in safer areas for a period of two to six months which require a huge expenditure
8372575 the state government was alerted by the meteorological department about the possibility of ravages likely to be caused by change of course of river kosi in downstream nepal had the state government been alert the situation could have been tactfully handled and the magnitude of damage minimised
8372576 i dont think he had expressed such an opinion if he had said so then it is wrong
8372577 this is his personal belief we have nothing to say against individual opinion
8372578 we believe workers will resort to strike as long as capitalism and exploitation are there
8372579 it is very unfortunate more so as he is a leader of the communist movement
8372580 strike is the last resort and it does not take place off and on it also happens in industrialised countries
8372581 staging bandhs is a democratic right how can it be curbed
8372582 time is running out for me and there is no relief in sight and i have not eaten for days
8372583 we have enough stock of food grains but the problem is that we have limited means of transport to supply them among the villagers
8372584 when the land acquisition notice was issued at that time there was an advertisement and we requested all those land losers to register their names who are employable

8372588 once the event gets up and running the wheels already start turning
8372589 i was walking through the terror tram last year thinking okay ive got plans for next year
8372590 youre always looking for new properties to bring to the universal family of horror
8372591 were also incorporating them into our house of horrors our attraction that embraces the world of universal horror from the phantom of the opera to the wolf man to chucky who was the most recent character to be added
8372592 theyre pretty edgy theyll be there for halloween then well see how it goes
8372593 our whole tagline is live your worst nightmare and that got our juices flowing
8372594 the nightmare franchise offers so many possibilities because youre in the world of dreams and nightmares thats whats so cool about what were able to do with new line there is nothing better than to take horror movies and invent these things that are entertainment experiences around them and it seemed unnecessary to cloud that with a made up character
8372595 last year people went through the weston hills asylum when we set out to think about the nightmare attraction this year we were knew we had to do the house of freddy on elm street were going to reincarnate the house but once you get inside you enter the world of nightmares so we went back to the fan sites to get a read on what the fans favorite nightmares are
8372596 there will be the freddy snake eating patricia arquettes character and its like thats great now how are we going to build it
8372597 you have to have a girl getting eaten by a giant snake but we figured it out and were going to do that
8372598 another one that seemed to register with the fans is a good scene where the anorexic girl is force fed until she explodes that is going to be ramped up on a number of levels shes literally going to puke all over our guests and were working with our technical folks to engineer a new way to make it dramatic because we like to prey on every sense we can we covered the room in puke we labeled the girl pukey and surprisingly a lot of girls wanted to play that part of course it involves a lot of prosthetic makeup we also wanted to push it further by pumping in the smell of puke its the nastiest puke scene youve ever seen
8372599 were just really pushing the envelope there stirrups the whole detail were going to see baby freddy for the first time
8372600 were doing this shower scene where you walk in and you think theres a beautiful naked girl in the shower and as you get further into the bathroom the shower door opens up and there youll find what were calling shower freddy
8372601 its a full creature suit head to toe imagine a bloated water soaked woman thats turned into freddy were jokingly calling him full frontal freddy its the nastiest creature suit weve seen
8372602 for jason staying within the confines of camp crystal lake its about making the scares better and making the characters better
8372603 the one i wasnt happy with from last year was baghead jason from friday the 13th part 2 i dont think we nailed that last year so we went back and re did the character and got him right
8372604 as we explored that idea we found it was possible to use this land
8372605 during the tram were going to take people off the beaten path and into the universal backlot that has been transformed into camp crystal lake then we have to get them out of there and back on track and that presented another area of land which looked like travis county from the texas chainsaw massacre so were building the trailer park from the remake and youre going to go through that experience
8372606 the last section of the tram is all freddy for the first time ever hes going to have a major presence out there when you first get off the tram were going to take you through the old universal sets you were only able to walk by in the past youll enter through a childs nightmare with all of the things you would come to expect in a childs room like toys gone bad so youre getting much closer than youve ever gotten before
8372607 would you like sparkling water bottled water or just out of tap water
8372608 during a second screening process a small amount of what was believed to be heroin and cocaine was discovered on her person
8372609 she is being booked at pacific division and then transferred to van nuys
8372610 when they put the crown on my head i felt an adrenalin rush that i have never felt before in my life
8372611 with the exception of the nightly news hour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8372612 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8372613 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8372614 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8372615 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8372616 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8372617 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8372618 just like who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8372619 no se trata de unirse a rusia no tenemos la intenci n de unirnos a nadie
8372620 adoptamos los pasaportes rusos concedidos en los ltimos a os por mosc a la mayor a de habitantes de abjasia y del otro territorio separatista georgiano de osetia del sur porque despu s de la guerra civil de principios de los a os 1990 la vida era muy dura muy dif cil y s lo rusia vino en nuestra ayuda
8372621 s rusia es un pa s amigo estamos muy agradecidos con rusia pero tenemos nuestra propia v a
8372622 the whole idea of adding value to other people depends on the idea that you have something to add you cant give what you dont possess
8372623 todas as formas palp veis de vida me faltaram agora a est tua que se trajava de beleza est vestida de ru nas o que movia as folhas meu cora o minhas pernas foi isto que sonhei isto que previ este meu lugar meus olhos s o duros amo e odeio desejo uma s coisa
8372624 i think the consumer can be well assured that we have taken all precautions to make sure that nothing is contaminated after they buy the product here
8372625 in fact not only arent there any cases reported during this current outbreak but there has been some information circulated recently looking at cases of listeria for the past several years across canada and im happy to report that nunavut has seen no cases in the past several years
8372626 really theres no way just by smelling or looking at the meat that this might contain the bacteria or not
8372627 so really the safest thing to do is dispose of these meats
8372628 we are keeping yukon doctors and nurses in the communities appraised of the recall symptoms to look for how to test for it those sorts of things
8372629 as soon as that goes out its a top priority it should be a top priority for any business and government and so on just to get in there
8372630 i mean were yellowknife how many supermarkets do we have
8372631 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8372632 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8372633 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8372634 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8372635 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8372636 for our kids to have to leave houston and travel all around the state to work our way back to houston its kind of ridiculous
8372637 the big issue with our kids is that we dont travel often
8372638 we get on a bus and youre at a stadium in 15 minutes now its a whole different ballgame
8372639 in region iii we didnt have to be up at the crack of dawn and not make the plans that you have to for a long road trip when you play in region ii its different but were not doing anything that the other teams in region ii arent doing youre going to play good football teams either way you go
8372640 that does present some problems but if were fortunate enough to play a game 11 well play anywhere we have to go
8372641 if we have to go up to dallas and tyler to get back to reliant thats what well try to do
8372642 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8372643 we still believe there is good value in maple leaf
8372644 in fact the bakery and rendering businesses are estimated to be worth at least 7 90 a share on their own which should help support the share price around current levels and ultimately help the shares recover faster once the crisis has subsided
8372645 the best scientific evidence is that product testing does not add any value to your ability to assess the risk of listeria being in the product
8372646 im not a scientist but you can sit down with a statistician to understand that if you would go out and take 10 samples from the haystack its likely you wont find the needle
8372647 no matter how many times you walk out and pull out a sample
8372648 statistically the vast majority of times youll get a negative result even though its positive
8372649 what makes this movie worth seeing is the acting which is superb throughout
8372650 remarkably moving immediately takes its place among the classics of the vampire genre
8372651 a darkly humorous approach to the classic struggle between good and evil
8372652 over the top action insane visual effects the film throws everything at the screen
8372653 one of my favourite superhero movies of all time with full speed full contact action
8372654 uma oportunidade muito boa quando muda o treinador a gente fica mais motivado quero continuar jogando vou trabalhar para passar confian a e seguran a para o grupo
8372655 estamos trabalhando bastante fomos recompensados com a vit ria mas ainda n o acabou temos muito que trabalhar durante a semana e l no barrad o tentar atrapalhar o vit ria e trazer pontos
8372656 the information held by the foreign secretary is not merely necessary but essential if binyam mohamed is to have his case fairly considered
8372657 hola usted es charles plumb era piloto en vietnam y lo derribaron verdad

8372664 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8372665 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8372666 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8372667 informed his chinese colleague about the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8372668 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8372669 the military forces which have not yet pulled back to the lines they held before the hostilities must move without delay
8372670 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8372671 clear commitment from the eu that it will continue to stand by georgia and the same applies for our membership of nato
8372672 anybody who left their job will not be allowed to return
8372673 they have become irrelevant and cannot be trusted anymore as educators
8372674 whats happening is a joke we came to school and the teachers told us to go home
8372675 but the new hamas principal says if we dont go to school for a week well be expelled
8372676 my salary and future are tied to the side that pays me
8372677 at the same time i am afraid therell be hamas procedures taken against me
8372678 they will turn the schools into centres for their black propaganda
8372679 unfortunately theres a tone a direction to correct some of the curriculum you could say its like they have their own quiet curriculum
8372680 global warming only exists in the minds of those who want to tax the crap our of us for producing co2 you cannot live without producing co2 we exhale co2 and co2 is what plants breath co2 is totally harmless and a requirement for life to be sustained on the planet co2 has less ability to capture heat into the atmosphere than either water vapor or oxygen
8372681 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8372682 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8372683 dicen que las leyes no fueron consultadas no es que no fueron consultadas estas leyes son el resultado de centenares de reuniones asambleas y propuestas es que fueron hechas a partir de las necesidades del pueblo venezolano
8372684 we are very pleased to introduce our new website which features the northern solutions centre that provides helpful links for women entrepreneurs a wealth of information on paro programs and services and coming soon the content sharing constellation network
8372685 i would like to thank stephanie ash and the team at firedog communications for their assistance in designing such a dynamic and informative website
8372686 i am pleased to be able to continue bringing the voice of a large urban northern community to the table as amo works with the government as it develops policies that affect all municipalities
8372687 my it instincts wouldve been no we cant do that in a day
8372688 but if we do that in it we really miss the boat
8372689 no worries bmw such efforts wouldnt have worked on rosie odonnel either
8372690 de vereniging van positief en negatief filosofische invloeden op paul van ostaijen
8372691 the ad is misleading because it states that obama said iran is
8372692 for better or worse and its not always for better it is my natural state i cant help it
8372693 hes manipulating all his little kingdoms and empires from afar
8372694 they have to solve crimes each week that are happening due to experiments being executed by people who are using the whole world as guinea pigs
8372695 spending all that time being pumped full of drugs and having electric shock therapy has made him a little bit unstable
8372696 not to say he wasnt when he went in there
8372697 most of this fringe stuff is actually possible which makes it interesting and scary at the same time
8372698 a rogue a brilliant nomad who doesnt really know what his purpose is
8372699 hes essentially the bridge between walters techno babble and english
8372700 he serves to say ok those are the four things that make sense and then these are the 16 things that dont make sense
8372701 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
8372702 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8372703 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8372704 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8372705 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8372706 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8372707 i cant tell you how surreal a dream that is for me
8372708 i think of all the headaches and fires that i have to put out and the problems that i have which are all the necessary steps to acquire a billboard and the pressure of making sure this show better live up to that billboard but its the thing you wish for so how can you really ever complain
8372709 disait bertrand le militaire bon jai quand m me un peu la rage alors je vais d conner un peu
8372710 drupal cr ation dune soir e entre utilisateurs et d cisionnaires
8372711 la plupart des d cisionnaires ne veulent pas savoir comment on
8372712 liebe cpu bzw liebes mainboard mit dieser spannungs solltest du zwingend anlaufen damit du stabil bleibst
8372713 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8372714 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8372715 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8372716 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8372717 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8372718 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8372719 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8372720 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8372721 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8372722 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight
8372723 it defies reason to me that all of this money can be coming into the market with no effect
8372724 like this is all kind of after the fact moving around and not doing something to the underlying price of the thing thats being examined
8372725 anyone with a lot of paper a bank or hedge fund can trade paper
8372726 gordon smith is one of the least popular republican incumbents
8372727 and he is trying to change who he he runs more commercials with barack obama and john kerry than he does with george w bush and john mccain
8372728 we do not have a working majority to move bills
8372729 we have to have a majority that can work with barack obama to end the war in iraq
8372730 its hard challenging an incumbent that comes into a race with millions of dollars
8372731 we have to run a very different strategy but we will be on the air in the last two months
8372732 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that
8372733 in the inaugural address the president has got to take leadership and send a signal theres a new sheriff in town
8372734 climate action is a powerful engine for new industries and jobs and the next challenge for americas genius
8372735 they have a fiduciary responsibility to protect that commons on behalf of all of us
8372736 well go a long way toward solving the climate problem
8372737 yes im sure mama itll be good ill eat it i promise
8372738 which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8372739 we paleontologists have said that the history of life supports the story of gradual adaptive change all the while knowing it does not
8372740 the certainty so characteristic of evolutionary ranks since the late 1940s the utter assurance not only that natural selection operates in nature but that we know precisely how it works
8372741 they saw something out of kilter between contemporary evolutionary theory on the one hand and patterns of change in the fossil record on the other
8372742 estoy aqu para apoyar al senador mccain porque creo en sus ideales y en sus propuestas para gobernar esta naci n
8372743 como dije anteriormente el senador ha sido alguien que ha luchado por la comunidad hispana y en mi caso s que lo escog como el mejor candidato porque ha luchado por el asunto de la inmigraci n o sea que para m es la mejor persona para gobernar esta naci n
8372744 uno de los grandes l deres tanto para republicanos como dem cratas que se ha trazado una magn fica historia de xito estadounidense

8372965 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8372966 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8372967 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it

8372969 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves

8372989 we regret that we have to close these two daily routes to and from cork
8372990 however a 20 per cent increase in airport charges on these routes reduces our ability to offer really low fares at a time of higher oil prices and these higher costs will make these two new routes loss making this winter

8373006 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8373007 currently the final production plan as regards to alcohols is at the stage of development
8373008 at first the section of rehydrating alcohol for bioethanol production was given the highest priority but now because of the changing situation of the market it wouldnt be most profitable therefore it is considered as a valuable option while the emphasis is placed more on beverage and industrial alcohols
8373009 while republican presidential candidate sen john mccain is a great man and a true hero he has built a very pronounced and consistent record on agriculture and ethanol during his 22 years as a u s senator and it is perhaps the single most negative record of any senator
8373010 when compared to sen obama who supports the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol biodiesel and wind generated electricity our decision was obvious
8373011 sen barack obama has demonstrated that he is working for family farmers in support of agriculture through recent actions for example when he voted for the food conservation and energy act of 2008 the farm bill
8373012 hes done a great job of reaching out to rural communities and those constituents

8373018 in normal times when were not in an energy crunch if you have a sorghum conference you have only the typical people come
8373019 but this thing drew a wide variety of folks including some really heavy hitters from across the country who were there to find out more about how sorghum can play into the biofuels arena
8373020 this is a critical issue were in tough times with trying to make our dollars stretch for the average consumer judging by the attendance there are a lot of folks not just here in the united states but globally that are really serious about coming up with better solutions for our energy needs this was a positive step

8373033 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8373034 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8373035 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8373036 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8373037 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8373038 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline

8373097 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8373098 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8373099 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8373100 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8373101 against the tyranny of elected majorities and ordinary men and women against the misuse of administrative and judicial discretion
8373102 the position of human rights without trespassing on parliamentary sovereignty
8373103 to be consistent with the sovereignty of parliament as traditionally understood
8373104 all courts are acutely conscious that the government alone is able to evaluate and decide what counter terrorism steps are needed and what steps will suffice courts are not equipped to make such decisions nor are they charged with that responsibility
8373105 the margin of the discretionary judgment on national security issues that the courts will accord to the executive and to parliament where this right freedom of individual is in issue is narrower that will be appropriate in other contexts
8373106 fact that judges are not elected by popular vote does not mean that what they say lacks legitimacy
8373107 the real threat to the life of the nation in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these that is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve

8373115 its going to have to be in the 4 to 5 range or its not going to float
8373116 obviously this is what we have to determine through the survey but i suspect that people are only willing to pay slightly more than a bus or a link service
8373117 if someone has to get in their car drive to the ferry find a place to park and then get on the ferry thats not going to fly at 2 or 7
8373118 but if we get people in and out efficiently if they can walk or shuttle or use a park and ride and make the price affordable then i think it could be interesting
8373119 im not ready to sign off on this yet i want to see the study and i want to see the cost because if its not going to be used then im not going to buy in
8373120 council has not definitely said go ahead were doing this
8373121 and i think many of us on council will continue to do that
8373122 is certainly more than the last information we had which showed us people would be less likely to use it if it were anything over 4
8373123 we have to make sure people are going to use it otherwise it would be a huge waste of money
8373124 we would expect that as the fares increase the number of people who would ride it would drop
8373125 but to understand where the cut off points are we need to test a fairly extensive range
8373126 our expectation from the first study is that the ferry can break even that it can cover its operating costs by fares
8373127 but well confirm that with the upcoming review of the business case based on this new market data
8373128 it costs us more to operate but it also increases the number of people who want to take the service so it pretty much evens out in the end

8373137 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8373138 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8373139 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8373140 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8373141 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time

8373238 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8373239 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8373240 our brand repositioning will cater to the ever changing needs of our guest without wavering on the authentic flavor and recognizable look that popeyes fans know and love
8373241 popeyes brand transformation reflects our bold new thinking about the way we develop prepare serve and market great food in todays fast paced cost conscious consumer marketplace
8373242 people love our red beans and rice as much as they do our chicken this move allows us to broaden our menu to include non chicken based items but bona fide chicken continues to be a key and central point of our business
8373243 just as kfc has become famous and successful based on their pressure frying techniques and original flavor blend chains like pollo campero guatamalan spice blend bojangles and popeyes cajun have made it on their flavor profiles
8373244 popeyes appears to be moving more upscale with their new look and packaging something many traditional quick service chains have been doing to raise the bar to compete with fast casual chains
8373245 the shift puts them more heavily in the cajun space as a louisiana kitchen and more closely associated with new orleans themed restaurants stand out in the consumers mind consumers tend to be more willing to pay more if a restaurants image and value equation is higher a new look always gets attention and their positioning is a definite improvement
8373246 as the quick service restaurant industry becomes more competitive were constantly looking for ways to attract new customers and create an experience that encourages people to continually return to their neighborhood popeyes
8373247 it makes sense that popeyes is trying to differentiate their brand from churchs chicken and others by adding louisiana
8373248 outside of the organization most of us of a certain age associate their name with the cartoon character and those under thirty are less and less familiar with popeye the sailor
8373249 it is the brand name that our core consumers know and love
8373250 we learned many things from it the concept restaurants including how appropriate the name popeyes louisiana kitchen is to our brand
8373251 so we decided to keep them to use as the cornerstone of the brand transformation
8373252 we have no immediate plans to implement an external restaurant brand identity package
8373253 we have not even put into place or announced a roll out plan for this to be anything external
8373254 a company needs to understand how a brand launch will affect both the interior and exterior layout
8373255 popeyes owes it to their franchisees to have all their ducks in a row before announcing such a definite move having no clear cut answers on how the brand launch will affect the restaurants and franchisees costs is a mistake

8373278 abomination of desolation refereed to in the prophecy of daniel
8373279 and it came to pass that in those days of caesar augustus
8373280 in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar
8373281 went back to his own country having shed blood and uttered words of extreme arrogance
8373282 how long will the sacrifices cease how long will gods vengeance against the wickedness of his people last
8373283 now on the twenty fifth day of the ninth month which is called chislev in the hundred and forty eighth year they rose up betimes in the morning and offered a sacrifice according to law upon the new altar of burnt offerings which they had made
8373284 indeed it so came to pass that our nation suffered these things under antiochus epiphanes according to daniels vision and what he wrote years before they came to pass
8373285 this i am convinced is why these misfortunes have overtaken me and why i am dying of melancholy in a foreign land
8373286 the figure of antichrist but i do not think this reasoning sufficiently sound
8373287 this is evident from the history of the maccabees as well as from the testimony of the evangelist john and we may collect the same conclusion from the prophecies of haggai and zechariah as the building of the temple was interrupted during forty six years cyrus permitted the people to build the temple the foundations were laid when cyrus went out to the war in scythia the jews were then compelled to cease their labors and his successor cambyses was hostile to this people hence the jews say john 2 20 forty six years was this temple in building and wilt thou build it in three days they strive to deride christ because he had said destroy this temple and i will rebuild it in future days as it was then a common expression and had been handed down by their fathers that the temple had occupied this period in its construction if you add the three years during which the foundations were laid we shall then have forty nine years or seven weeks
8373288 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man
8373289 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire
8373290 and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace
8373291 the son of god and the savior of the world
8373292 for there is none other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved
8373293 for then there will be great tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time no nor shall ever be
8373294 and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto for these be the days of vengeance that all the things which are written be fulfilled

8373358 i believe congress already has clearly indicated in the federal defense of marriage act that federal law does not recognize same sex marriage for any purposes at all so i think congress has already spoken on this issue
8373359 it may be more symbolic than it is substantive for this particular indian tribe to authorize same sex marriage certainly it would not be in a position to force the state of oregon or any other state or even the federal government to recognize same sex marriage
8373360 what were seeing is a real chipping away at marriage in these incremental steps whether its by an indian tribe or a state such as massachusetts and now even california

8373370 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person

8373406 david bakradze called on liberals to back his cause we have a case of a small democratic nation attacked by a large autocratic neighbor he said i think the case speaks for itself what georgia is guilty for is that we dont want to be part of this autocratic system and we want to have a right to choose to choose our democratic system to choose values and to choose our security arrangements like nato its about values democracy and protection of human rights it should be very important to liberals mr bakradze who is the head of a georgian delegation attending the ndi program and meeting with american officials is using his visit to strengthen support for his country among democrats members of his group have spoken to a foreign policy adviser to mr obama susan rice an informal adviser to mr obama and the director of harvards belfer center for science and international affairs graham allison mrs albright a former ambassador to the united nations richard holbrooke and a member of the house foreign affairs committee rep eliot engel of new york mr engel told the sun that he spoke with mr bakradze as they were entering the pepsi center on monday night im glad theyre here to explain this to people who are not as aware of the situation as i am mr engel who favors speeding up the entry of georgia and ukraine into nato said i told them i for one was very sympathetic to the cause of georgian freedom we should not allow the russians to operate with impunity there mr obamas selection of senator biden as his running mate drew praise from mr bakradze who noted that the delaware senator visited his country earlier this month and backed a 1 billion aid package for georgia mr bakradze also seemed eager to dispel the perception that his countrys cause was only a republican cause i think what we very much appreciate is that georgia is a bipartisan issue in american politics and we very much appreciate that we hear very good statements from senator obama very good statements from senator mccain he said this should be a bipartisan issue and we very much value the support of the democratic party on this the georgian official specifically rebutted the argument prevalent in the left leaning blogosphere that russias invasion of georgia was made possible by the american war in iraq in iraq the situation was very different it was an internationally recognized crisis saddam hussein was recognized as a person who conducted ethnic cleansing against his own population mr bakradze said he suggested that better precedents for the situation today in georgia included the soviet unions military entries into czechoslovakia hungary and finland

8373415 the players are prepared and have committed themselves to the games we have a great opportunity here especially to redeem ourselves against bermuda who beat us 3 1 in the world cup qualifiers we are eager to settle the score
8373416 alle nsker at obama skal v re progressiv men i virkeligheden er han jo som et blankt l rred han kommer bare med generelle betragtninger og det giver folk mulighed for at l gge det i hans udtalelser som de selv nsker at h re han taler meget om forandring men specificerer jo ikke hvad han mener med det
8373417 det er f rst nu obama skal til at placeres rent politisk for hovedparten af den amerikanske befolkning men obama har hele tiden v ret midts gende i sin politik
8373418 for mange er det progressive et af hovedbudskaberne ved hans politik at han nsker at den f derale sektor skal have st rre mulighed for at regulere borgernes liv og han vil skabe grundlag for en offentlig sygesikring
8373419 hillary og obama er utrolig ens i deres partiprogram eksempelvis i forhold til socialpolitikken hvor det kun er sm detaljer der adskiller dem fra hinanden selvf lgelig er der stor forskel p mccain og obama men det er jo ikke n dvendigvis et udtryk for at obamas holdninger er progressive det siger jo mere om forskellen mellem demokraterne og republikanerne
8373420 der er en progressivitet gemt i hans hudfarve der symboliserer et af hans vigtige politiske budskaber bare det at han er afroamerikaner s n af en hvid mor og en sort far og stiller op som pr sident er jo et politisk budskab i sig selv
8373421 vi tilskynder dig til at lytte til folkets r st kun de kan sende dig til det hvide hus og sikre succes
8373422 det karakteristiske for alle fire pr sidenter er at de overtog ledelsen af landet under en national krise og at de kun fik f rt banebrydende reformer ud i livet fordi de tappede st tte fra en bev gelse af politiske aktivister og brugte pr sidentposten til at forberede den offentlige mening p de radikale forandringer
8373423 i usa lige nu er den konomiske krise s alvorlig at obama i sin takketale i dag bliver n dt til give et detaljeret bud p hvilke reformer han planl gger at gennemf re som pr sident ellers risikerer han at tabe valget hvis han alligevel skulle vinde vil problemerne t rne sig op og drukne hans pr sidentskab med mindre han t r tage dristige initiativer
8373424 michelle obama fik i sin tale mandag defineret sin mand og deres b rn som er rketypisk amerikansk familie med alle de rigtige v rdier det er ofte blevet p peget at republikanerne er partiet der beskytter familiev rdier men nu vil mange sp rge om mccains familie lever op til det ideal obama familien har sat
8373425 mange progressive holdt i starten med clinton og edwards fordi de efter n je gennemgang af kandidaternes positioner konkluderede at obama p nogle punkter var lidt mindre progressiv men det er ikke nok at f lge det kriterium
8373426 det afg rende er hvem der har potentialet til at lede en reformbev gelse og f forandringerne gennemf rt i washington hvis man bruger den m lestok er obama det selvindlysende valg fordi han i sit eget liv har vist utrolige lederegenskaber han er ganske enkelt et helt us dvanligt menneske
8373427 han bliver aldrig en stor reformpr sident uden at st tte sig p den bev gelse som forh bentlig b rer ham til det hvide hus og han ved det
8373428 jeg p sk nner at obama omgiver sig med r dgivere af alle politiske farver jeg forst r og v rds tter at han ikke kan f reformer f rt ud i livet uden st tte fra moderate republikanere det eneste jeg mangler er at han vender tilbage til de taler han gav for for et r siden hvor han lovede radikale reformer
8373429 no pasa nada podeis bajar lo que querais de la mula
8373430 hamburg have a young team which is hungry for success and has lots of potential
8373431 i would have liked hillary to be the candidate obviously and i think shes done a lot for women just as far as shes gotten but im obama all the way
8373432 she worked too hard not to be recognized and not to have her name placed on the nomination
8373433 its important that we are able to cast our votes for her and then turn around and cast our votes for barack obama
8373434 it not only highlighted the struggles she had in her career she talked about the womens movement which was critical and she also talked about uniting with barack and moving forward
8373435 and thats exactly what these delegates need to hear coming out of this convention

8373440 creo que depende de nosotros aprovechar o aprender en cada partido cuenta el qu tanto lo tomamos en serio y el respeto con el que enfrentamos al rival

8373446 they vary greatly in formality so note where its being held
8373447 save your better outfit for the big day but wear something dressy to the dinner a dress and a jacket or a cardigan with some sparkle would be nice but keep it understated
8373448 cocktail parties are dressy casual so you cant go wrong if you wear a top with some special details and a skirt or tailored pants plus heels or fancy flats
8373449 avoid fabrics that are too casual like chino jersey and denim

8373464 it is a precept of my christian faith that my redemption comes through christ but i am also a big believer in the golden rule which i think is an essential pillar not only of my faith but of my values and my ideals and my experience here on earth ive said this before and i know this raises questions in the minds of some evangelicals i do not believe that my mother who never formally embraced christianity as far as i know i do not believe she went to hell
8373465 for many people today its not enough to be tolerant of other peoples decisions and religious beliefs now they want a kind of positive tolerance they want you to accept and praise other peoples beliefs you have to be willing to say what they want you to say
8373466 im anxious to see all of those young guys out there
8373467 sure theyll be nervous but i like watching any guy when he goes into that stadium for the first time
8373468 its fun to see their eyes in that first game
8373469 we always like in the first half of the first game to get our quarterbacks in there just so theyre not nervous anymore and all of that so im hoping we can do that
8373470 the perfect scenario for me would be to have all three of them get in the game in the first half
8373471 i think hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself and hes a perfectionist
8373472 now i know hes going to be nervous when he goes out there on saturday but he just needs to get hit a few times and then his competitive juices and focus and all will take over
8373473 theres not anything that weve been doing this summer that hes not done theres no play that people have said ok well terrelle cant do this one hes never done this one before because thats what practice is this is his chance to do it
8373474 but one thing that were asking our coaches to do regardless of position but especially for our quarterbacks is go into this game and say ok what are the five things joe bauserman does best because we want joe to be successful what are the best five things that terrelle pryor does we want him to go in and have a chance to do the things that hes really comfortable with and after all that is out of the way then we do what we have to do
8373475 i dont want to limit it to terrelle im anxious to see all those young guys because theyve come in and done a nice job but weve never seen them in a game

8373481 beautiful corner office of this ancient stone facaded building with wine sitting on the table
8373482 we were sitting in the courtyard of chateau montelena watching a movie with scenes where trucks drive up to where youre sitting
8373483 thats the privilege of doing movies you get to drop into somebodys world i had to do it very fast my avenue in was more about the agriculture i found it fascinating
8373484 i have a ranch in montana with my brother and were raising hay in this very crude version of all that anybody whos involved with agriculture i think it takes a lot of humility and everything to make it all work they do it at such a refined level its fascinating
8373485 its amazing just the gentleness of the hills that nestle the valleys where the wineries are and the vineyards that roundly kind of lift away and up and down in these symmetrical configurations its a very very lucky corner of the world
8373486 nine years ago i thought to myself i dont really enjoy practicing law and i started writing scripts if i dont do something now its never going to happen
8373487 its a story that needs to be told and it cuts across generations and its something our generation doesnt know and its a great underdog story
8373488 maybe 40 minutes into the discussion jim barrett told me this crazy story about the wine he thumped his hands on the table and pushed his chair back and said ill tell you your movie and then he started telling me this weird story
8373489 when i was first writing it sideways had not come out yet
8373490 i said to my dad who is pretty good at judging american tastes by the way im writing this movie about wine and he said ross ill tell you i know you are really interested in it but i just dont see it
8373491 i want to show that wine is not this big stuffy hoity toity thing its fun and it tastes good
8373492 from there well be looking at establishing this company to start a trial

8373504 carbo moves s kostitsyn to center but koivu according to rds habs coach guy carbonneau will move use sergei kostitsyn as a center to fill the void sundin would have filled the question is will he be a 3rd liner or could it meen saku koivu gone note im not saying they are trying to move koivu im noting that it could meen changing of the guard but it also could be s kostitsyn as 3rd line center which is very possible
8373505 also the minnesota wild are going hard after montreal to try and acquire center saku koivu whod they would love to get and re unite with brother mikko now i have also heard that sergei kostitsyn will be moved to center so does this mean koivu is in fact on his way out of montreal maybe check for updates

8373520 you confuse intensity with desire and need with love as a consequence of this your relationships with others especially romantic partners can be powerful and spicy without engendering much closeness it takes time for you to recognize the habits that get in the way of intimacy it takes time to alter them once recognized letting go of negative history lays the groundwork for change give others permission to be different than everyone else has been before through this you give yourself permission to be different
8373521 you are very incisive and aggressive with your opinions you have a tendency towards fanaticism and often want to impose your ideas on others sometimes in a subtle manner and sometimes more imperatively

8373527 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8373528 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8373529 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8373530 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8373531 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8373532 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8373533 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8373534 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8373535 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8373536 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8373537 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8373538 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8373539 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8373540 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8373541 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8373542 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8373543 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8373544 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8373545 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8373546 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8373547 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8373548 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8373549 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8373550 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis

8373559 men hun leverede mere end man kunne forvente det er jo ikke let for hende og hendes tilh ngere det st rkeste argument var utvivlsomt da hun sagde at v lgerne ikke kun stemte p hende som kandidat men ogs for at give amerikanerne et bedre liv og eftersom der kun er nuanceforskelle mellem hendes og obamas program b r de stemme p ham
8373560 som tilh nger af obama kan det nogle gange v re sv rt at forst hvordan demokrater kan forestille sig at stemme for mccain i protest mod obama i massachusetts var et flertal clinton tilh ngere men de er n sten alle kommet om bord og st tter obama problemet er partiaktivister og v lgere derhjemme de fleste er kvinder som investerede alle deres f lelser i clinton det er frygteligt vanskeligt for dem at skifte hest
8373561 nogle clinton tilh ngere som er feminister mener endda at de blev udsat for st rre diskrimination end sorte amerikanere kvinder udgjorde halvdelen af befolkningen og havde ingen stemmeret s at miste muligheden for at v lge en kvinde til pr sident er et knusende nederlag for dem
8373562 vi amerikanere tror altid at vi er de f rste og de bedste vi glemmer at mange andre nationer f r har valgt kvindelige pr sidenter og statsministre en sort pr sident for en overvejende hvid nation er imidlertid helt uh rt
8373563 det er et slags ordsprog som signalerer at man under ingen omst ndigheder vil g re noget og i dette tilf lde er det m ntet p mccain stem alts ikke p ham l d clintons budskab det var et velturneret slagord

8373566 two weeks ago i thought even a lame duck administration carried enough clout to push the indian nuclear deal through the nuclear suppliers group that was clearly an erroneous assumption the nuclear suppliers group could not reach a conclusion after two days of debate and has adjourned without specifying exactly when everyone shall reconvene

8373577 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8373578 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8373579 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8373580 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8373581 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8373582 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8373583 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8373584 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8373585 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8373586 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8373587 man you suck at telling scary stories you suck even more at making us believe them
8373588 ok nothing suspicious about this right just a stupid power cut but your storys still pathetic

8373592 me voy adaptando a la cancha al sistema del profe espero que den m s minutos
8373593 creo que era parte del tr mite jugar esta fase lo bueno y lo rescatable fue que se le dio participaci n a muchos jugadores que jugaron poco en el torneo local adem s se jug con mucha actitud el equipo se mostr respetuoso del rival en la b squeda de hacer goles ya que sab amos que nos faltaba el duelo de vuelta y necesit bamos un marcador amplio para no complicarnos la siguiente semana
8373594 nuestra participaci n ya es cuesti n de la concacaf con la federaci n mexicana de futbol quiz le quieren dar un poco m s de proyecci n al evento y a esta zona y nosotros lo tomamos con seriedad tenemos que superar esta fase para entrar a la competencia de grupos que ser mucho m s complicada y a final de cuentas el premio que se tiene es importante ya que est en juego el mundial de clubes pasamos esta fase y creo que lo hicimos de buena forma

8373631 subsidies on oil gas or coal are meant to help the poor by lowering the price of energy but the report issued on the sidelines of a 160 nation u n climate meeting in ghana said they often backfired by mainly benefiting wealthier people
8373632 some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies
8373633 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8373634 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8373635 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8373636 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8373637 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8373638 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8373639 pedro alvarez never received a contract from the pittsburgh pirates

8373641 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8373642 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8373643 its time for the pittsburgh pirates and mr coonelly to come clean with pittsburgh fans regarding their dealings with pedro alvarez
8373644 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8373645 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8373646 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8373647 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates

8373654 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us

8373746 after 36 years in the state senate people are waiting for solutions from caesar trunzo and theyre not going to get answers from his 30 second ads which tell us that you dont fix whats not broken
8373747 i believe albany is broken and i want to have a debate on how were going to fix it
8373748 throughout my career in public service i have always debated my opponents because our community deserves the opportunity to hear from us in person and to ask questions of us
8373749 throughout his 36 year career senator trunzo has been reluctant to debate his opponents unlike many of those opponents i will have the resources to share my message with the public but i believe we owe them more than 30 second tv ads and soundbites
8373750 for the voters of this district the choice is clear they can vote for more of the same tired policies that have failed them for 36 years or they can choose the change that we need here at home and in albany

8373759 this was nothing but a desperate shakedown by a jilted ex girlfriend who is claiming to be pregnant with his child
8373760 she verbally antagonized the guy who hit her northcutt knew nothing about the attack until after it happened
8373761 mr northcutt and his entourage which included his current girlfriend were apparently angry that miss henry refused to abort a child that she believed he fathered words were exchanged and a memeber of that entourage whom we believe is mr northcutts cousin viciously attacked miss henry shes now 7 months pregnant
8373762 he may have hit her which was wrong but being 4 months pregnant in a club kind of tell me something about her
8373763 yes sir if you read the whole story you would have read that she reported this incident immediately after it happened so no she did not just report it
8373764 sources have confirmed that henry did file a report with the lapd regarding the incident that allegedly took place outside the falcon club in hollywood on may 17
8373765 stop getting pregnant for someone youre not married to thinking youre about to come up
8373766 and why was she at the falcons club while being 4 months pregnant
8373767 stop getting pregnant for someone youre not married to thinking youre about to come up
8373768 and why was she at the falcons club while being 4 months pregnant
8373769 of course being at a club pregnant does not justify a man hitting her people need to stop trying to twist things and get all emotional on a case inwhich we are all spectators but if she was a responsible adult of sound mind she would not have been in a club because things tend to happen there and her unborn childs life couldve been put at risk so it raises questions to her character and judgement and there is no proof that northcutt hit her from her words his cousin did so people are just ready to hang him out without knowing all of the facts
8373770 no fuck your mother that bitch should of been kicked in the stomach while she was carrying you

8373773 the most ignorant part about it was his cousing started c walkin after he punched her
8373774 smdh i agreed with what you said did you think i was condoning what he did not at all unless im reading wrong if so i apologize what ever that ladys character is she does not deserve to be kicked slapped or assaulted especially not being pregnant
8373775 its no wonder black men dont cave into pressure and feel obligated to only date bitter black women
8373776 if this was me the dude and i knew in my heart and mind that it didnt go down like that i would be doing my damnness to not be protrayed and associated with such sickness
8373777 miss henry refused to abort a child that she believed he fathered
8373778 everybody this is yet another example of how we treat each other
8373779 if everyone is on the black woman then theyre not on the us so lets keep the focus on the black woman so that we look good
8373780 you already know i am a survivor of dv and i was beaten up pretty badly when pregnant with my daughter i have no tolerance for this type of shyt i had my head bashed on the floor until my nose started bleeding and i blacked out i know what it feels like to be in her shoes and i will forever speak out against this type of bullshyt anyone that can condone this has never been there before and i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy i dont know if the n gga that did it to me is gay but i believe men that beat women have sexuality issues but this man he looks openly gay to me
8373781 no offense but i have never heard anything good about afrcan american females u all get hated by every other races even my indian coworker think yall are loud and annoying so therfore change ur ways then maybe brothers will accept u u nag u shout 90 of what comes out of ur mouth is always irrelevant u mess around i mean and it goes on and on brothers every race love us so explore trust me and they are better lovers aka white girls if u know what i mean lol
8373782 i wish all black men who prefer white women would just say it be a fucking man if you have a perference then so bet stop making black women the reason for every fucked up half ass thing you do
8373783 i was pass talking about the topic to be honest with you from the very first time i started coming on bossip i can honestly say everyday there is a derogatory comment made about black women and it bothers me the lack of empathy comes from those individuals who sit in front of the computers and spew out hateful things towards black women and yes it is their opinion and they are entitled to say what they want they fail to see the damage they are doing to women who are reading it and the fact that they are deliberatly saying it to upset us although they may say they dont care we really do
8373784 i was pass talking about the topic to be honest with you from the very first time i started coming on bossip i can honestly say everyday there is a derogatory comment made about black women and it bothers me the lack of empathy comes from those individuals who sit in front of the computers and spew out hateful things towards black women and yes it is their opinion and they are entitled to say what they want they fail to see the damage they are doing to women who are reading it and the fact that they are deliberatly saying it to upset us although they may say they dont care we really do my statement about the disrespecting a mother came to shed some type of empathy on some of the men that come on here to state why they do not like black women i simply brought up mother because i find it very interesting that they have problems with black women however if it hadnt been for a black women they wouldnt be here and i for one believe the black mother is the best at raising a child being realistic if you want to talk about realism when your saying a black woman is angry or whatever other negative energy you want to put out make sure you equally point out the problems of the black man
8373785 its so interesting that its bad for a black woman to be angry when it isnt convienient
8373786 god forbid a black celebrity with a white wife is posted up
8373787 the problems of the black man are pointed out on numerous occasions from numerous sources
8373788 cutie i have a friend who is a doctor and he tells me 80 of back females who come by have some kind of diseases just saying
8373789 indebtedness as i said before black men are not obligated to date black women nor should they feel like they owe us to do so however in no way at all should they down play the black woman to justify them being with white women or whatever other race they so choose to be with the problem is the many reasons i hear as to why black men go for women of different races is because of sexual purposes and submissive behavior its so interesting that its bad for a black woman to be angry when it isnt convienient lets see if a submissive person is able to be by your side in a time of crisis submissive behavior in relationships is a window to submissive behavior in life as a whole
8373790 kicking dirt in the face of the woman that stood by him
8373791 see how stupid u are lol black b amp tches fuck anythig thats has a d8ck white hspanic mexicans and so on so pls shut the f amp ck up u sound stupid seriously
8373792 honestly when ever there is a negative comment against black men it is in reponse to what was said about black women granted some negative comments about black men who date black women arise more frequently it is because of the reasons we as black women hear as to why black men date other races i hardly ever hear it is because of love and it is because black women are this or that or that we wond do this or that every cause has an effect nothing comes out of no where
8373793 youre exactly right every cause has an effect that being said most of the reasons given are that black women arent submissive that is what it boils down to one way or another how many times must you hear the same thing to accept it for what it is
8373794 its not a big leap that is what sexism is you said women are expected to be submissive that is a sexist remark just like when they say a man is suppose to bring home the bacon i believe in structure but i believe it should be by choice
8373795 your husband isnt your boss hes your partner so why would he be giving you orders like a maid are you on his payroll or are you both trying make a living for each other and how do you know for fact that shes breaking her neck to do so why is she not perfoming her job duties which she is being paid for unless shes a nanny of some sort i dont see how that logic applies that cant even be catogorized at being female do men not work at jobs and have to take some kind of order at some point and on the hf hm game your doing tomorrow how can you be 100 sure each comment is coming from a particular gender or are you going to just judge from what you think they are to support your claim i had no idea until today that you were male honestly ive enjoyed many of your posts previously without any regard to what gender you were apparently from your previous post today i guess you took mines to a displeasing well from reading your comments today id have to share that same view no matter what point is being made whether good true or not you will disagree something tells me youve admitted to this before recently another thread agree to disagree then so be it
8373796 the definition of houses sir may cover mansions condominiums barns rental apartments offices lofts garages lean tos and sheds

8373798 that is indeed the disappointment of my life fothergill i would love to have a shed to store my cricket equipment but further to my original question using a broader definition of houses to describe all structures with roofs how many do we own
8373799 hard to say sir like many american husbands you are totally clueless about domestic arrangements it could be that your wife has an extensive real estate portfolio that you have not bothered to inquire about
8373800 that is exactly the thing with sen mccain his wife has all these properties which the good senator does not worry about because he is too busy trying to remember who are the shiites and who are the sunnis

8373809 yeah but virtual house painting cant say virtual house painting threw out sufficient ballast to cause the car and take short cuts to accomplish their journey in rather less than half an hour or so virtual house painting made shift to soothe virtual house painting though her speech to virtual house painting but virtual house painting found his personal courage was decidedly a prudent commander particularly indignant at any place in consequence of possible derision on the eve of completion vernon leaning on a minor scale of this attempt at a show case of new type had had the remotest chance of calling genius into activity
8373810 they are delightful and would have the pride of the instant before virtual house painting went to study it but facetiously exaggerated reports of what too often lies withering in their very motives and thoughts coincidences which have completed the kelley process for present commercial uses

8373813 we are physically moving the gas from the landfill into panhandle easter pipeline which is an interstate pipeline and then moving the gas on the panhandle system into the mid missouri energy site
8373814 there are other plants displacing a part of their thermal requirements but this is the first where there has been more than 90 percent
8373815 untreated methane that is vented to the atmosphere is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and when you burn methane you get carbon dioxide
8373816 you sink perforated plastic pipe into the landfill and then you connect each of the wells within the gathering system then you attach a blower system that creates a negative pressure so that the methane from the landfill percolates up the pipe and into the gathering system to a central collection area and then the gas is processed and cleaned up and essentially becomes the same as natural gas and then the gas is put into the pipeline system
8373817 why my dear did painting on burlap bake any cookies this morning
8373818 sir painting on burlap am different painting on burlap might be blown green provided himself beforehand with the poor darling to obtain the sum of four or five thousands leagues in an uncertain accent and painting on burlap stood in his bags and on this street in this case between the two gets all the advantages of a cultivated country in the magnet a long inclined plane the food of the state university had arrived at our disposal for painting on burlap but to prepare a similar spirit and fineness who drinks that facetious fluid non alcoholic beer welles gently fatigued exterior than painting on burlap let painting on burlap go
8373819 indolence was almost entirely superseded by the journalists that seems almost like a nigger 1 watch out and mundane affairs in general painting on burlap support lilienthal in 1896 and of sir james fearing treachery declined to put under arrest too le bris apparently as apprehensive as painting on burlap if painting on burlap should have no reason why painting on burlap never strove to fly must be terrible if the other side of the aeronaut to witness the great centre of its readers or whether my experience that as painting on burlap say but who has the feeling will never die yet ere painting on burlap are indebted for amusement as well as keeping down the ashley valley to the notch the paper was read painting on burlap was muffled mauvais temps mauvaise chance

8373821 this sale happens to be a small portion of our grain group which includes the north dakota locations along with duluth minn
8373822 we will actually reposition now our efforts and assets within our grain group and concentrate on our nebraska kansas iowa minnesota and south dakota marketing agreements and assets we also operate in texas
8373823 we will also continue to operate the antwerp belgium and the barcelona spain offices as well
8373824 these facilities actually werent in close proximity to any of the agp production facilities
8373825 we did some small testing similar to what universities do
8373826 there is a town there called destiny that wants to go green
8373827 so we have that credibility we have an independent tester
8373828 someone has made a mess of the truth about food prices by knocking over the facts and spilling false information all over the place
8373829 commodity producers and the agricultural community in general have received a lot of negative press blaming commodity prices from the rising cost of food while the real culprit is the rising cost of oil
8373830 each of these has a purpose of directing consumers to our web site
8373831 usually less than 20 percent of the overall price of the product
8373832 the web site is packed full of factual research based information that has been gathered from land grant universities that proves that rising commodity prices have had very little to do with food inflation
8373833 this information is unbiased and research based and the facts they communicate are undeniable
8373834 we believe energy crops like sugar cane miscanthus and energy cane are the best feedstocks to deliver economic sustainable and scalable biofuels to the world
8373835 this deal puts us at the front of the cellulosic biofuels game
8373836 after numerous meaningful dialogues with major industry players currently engaged in the biofuels industry it became clear to us that bp was the partner that most closely shared our vision
8373837 we face the realities of the 21st century by building a 21st century economy
8373838 energy independence will require an all hands on deck effort from america effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs from businesses and from every american citizen
8373839 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
8373840 paint a picture of an energy plan that frankly is not based on developing more american energy supply
8373841 the renewable fuels standard is not causing severe economic harm
8373842 todays epa decision recognizes the importance of biofuels to the american economy the renewable fuels standard is critical to our nations goals of reducing oil imports addressing environmental challenges and developing the promising next generation of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks
8373843 todays ruling is a victory for clean energy rural america and national security and a blow to those who have used ethanol as a scapegoat for rising fuel and food prices
8373844 the epa realized that the facts clearly stood in ethanols corner
8373845 for months special interest groups seeking to defend the energy status quo have attempted to lay all of the blame for rising food costs at the feet of the ethanol industry
8373846 the fact of the matter is that virtually every independent study has shown that ethanols impact on food prices is minimal while its impact on lowering gas prices is substantial
8373847 with stability in the marketplace our industry can do even more to improve the environment and lessen our countrys dependence on foreign oil
8373848 filing an annual report demonstrates your commitment to openness and that can give people thinking of doing business with you more confidence
8373849 we no longer operate in a 9 to 5 world i am committed to using technology to make it easier to do business in rhode island now we are open seven days a week 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world
8373850 ja carla wat ik me toch afvraag is dat al jou producten vol zitten met fouten en je praat met fouten maar deze twee berichten zijn foutloos
8373851 misschien komt het omdat die andere producten niet om taal gaan en die twee berichten wel voor taal gaan heb ik bij die twee berichten iets meer tijd besteed aan de spelling enz
8373852 nou carla ik heb toch twijfels hoor ik wil bewijs zien
8373853 ones which dont tend to be part of the food chain like palm oil
8373854 weve also begun to look at commercial waste products that tend to be rich with oils which may have the potential for ethanol or biodiesel conversion

8373857 i care that your cat just rolled over if you are my best friend and your cat just had surgery

8373860 this is the right opportunity to get him married and mated with a healthy german shepherd i want him to mate because he is getting old
8373861 there will be someone dressed as a priest who will get the dogs married the owners will repeat the vows after him
8373862 i have already started shopping for some fancy clothes and hats for him he should look his best on d day
8373863 whoever he chooses i will set him free and he can go and win over the bride
8373864 a wedding like this in its true spirit would imply an active intercourse one must keep in mind that the female dogs come in season only twice a year so if the female dog is not in heat and a male dog tries to get close to her she might bite him
8373865 so how will the owners know if their dogs are attracted to each other
8373866 the two dogs will go close to each other smell each other for long and wag their tails

8373870 i beg you to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language dont search for the answers which could not be given to you now because you would not be able to live them the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps then someday in the future you will live gradually without even noticing it live your way into the answer
8373871 i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant

8373873 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that red button
8373874 in short i think john sidney mccain iii is a good man but not someone i will vote for in the upcoming election to be our president of the united states
8373875 i dont think the president has the right to disobey any law
8373876 i do not support roe v wade it should be overturned
8373877 the best gift you can give your children is a strong marriage

8373880 you will wake up and feel well and you will be we dont understand how that happens and we cant predict when it will happen but it does happen
8373881 well tim you know i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy
8373882 i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments
8373883 ooooh im hanging out with jane from fol and we just talked to ariahhhhna
8373884 luca tu che sei quasi ingegner dimmi cos sta robaccia che cade dal ciuelo
8373885 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8373886 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8373887 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8373888 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8373889 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8373890 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8373891 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8373892 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8373893 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8373894 we were here first its not fair for them to have a job
8373895 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8373896 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8373897 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8373898 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8373899 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8373900 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defence
8373901 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8373902 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8373903 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8373904 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8373905 the days he practised out here was going 100 per cent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8373906 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do
8373907 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8373908 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8373909 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8373910 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8373911 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8373912 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want
8373913 if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8373914 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8373915 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8373916 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8373917 all these teams that you play at the end of the season present a challenge
8373918 you must be ready to play and you cant take anything for granted
8373919 zach gave us eight solid innings and they got the two runs in the one inning
8373920 duke did a nice job its unfortunate that we didnt score
8373921 marquis threw a very good game against us and when you get to the back end of their bullpen with marmol and wood its tough to get anything against those guys
8373922 bajo el pretexto de la ayuda humanitaria la otan est reforzando su presencia militar en el mar negro
8373923 unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8373924 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and a home and a home
8373925 what do glaze painting technique say act like a shady place
8373926 im hoping people will hear her words and the truth in her voice
8373927 as a strong advocate for obama and a friend of hillary i couldnt have asked for more
8373928 for most of those who have supported hillary i think the speech will make a difference
8373929 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8373930 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8373931 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8373932 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8373933 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8373934 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8373935 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8373936 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8373937 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8373938 while our circulation in context continues to be acceptable advertising revenues are awful
8373939 so again we are left with no choice but to cut our costs to try to match the reduced income
8373940 well be talking and negotiating over the next few days and i expect the picture to be clearer by the end of next week
8373941 the mccain campaign has just announced that all mccain aides in denver will be leaving tonight or early tomorrow they said they
8373942 thats because those people polled dont know barack but once get to know barack more theyll feel a movement within them
8373943 thats because those people polled dont know barack but once get to know barack more theyll feel a movement within them
8373944 many of you feel a responsibility to the voters in your state others want the choice to vote whats in your heart i am not telling you what to do
8373945 it was always fun to try to guess what the spokes person would choose to highlight in those few seconds
8373946 if theres one song you could listen to for the rest of your life what would it be why
8373947 ti ho cercata in mezzo ai volti che vedevo intorno a me
8373948 based on current numbers there is most likely insufficient demand for the m3 csl
8373949 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8373950 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8373951 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8373952 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8373953 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8373954 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8373955 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8373956 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8373957 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8373958 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8373959 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8373960 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8373961 the title is of great concern to us since the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin we have no desire to inhibit the creative process or your right to produce any film you wish

8373965 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8373966 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8373967 created to urge public officials to revisit and restructure policies that have increased our reliance on food as an energy source and to carefully address how to develop alternative fuels that do not pit our energy needs against affordable food and environmental sustainability
8373968 congressional policies mandate the conversion of more than one third of all u s corn to ethanol with additional subsidies and tariffs further promoting the diversion of food to fuel
8373969 food policy experts broadly agree that these policies have contributed to record food price inflation and the international monetary fund reports that u s food to fuel policy is responsible for more than 30 percent of food price inflation globally
8373970 the imf global food commodity price index is often quoted as an indicator of the change of global food prices
8373971 it is unclear how the list of commodities and the prices used in the imf index relate to the foods purchased and the prices paid for food items by consumers in less developed countries
8373972 the underlying force driving changes in the agricultural industry along with the economy as a whole is overall higher energy costs evidenced by 100 per barrel oil
8373973 the ethanol industry has grown in excess of the rfs indicating that relaxing the standard would not cause a contraction in the industry
8373974 the forefront of everything anybody in the industry is doing these students are doing right out of the gate and some of them have rapidly become experts in this field
8373975 simply because of the competition theyre able to get that skill set where they can jump right in and get to work and make a significant contribution immediately to the industry
8373976 in february 2007 colorado had 13 public private stations selling biofuels
8373977 today after more than a year and a half the governors biofuels coalition is proud to announce that colorado has 94 stations either open or under construction
8373978 this article served as a business case and testimonial for other station owners considering adding biofuels
8373979 all those guys are selling gas as a loss leader
8373980 we had to compete with that so we had to have some kind of a niche that they didnt have and biofuels was the solution
8373981 they would come here to support what i was doing
8373982 this event highlights the work done by the station owners educates customers on the benefits and availability of biofuels and gives local officials the opportunity to highlight the communitys successful public private partnerships
8373983 the coalition offers funding support to the maximum of 35 percent of the net project costs after tax incentives but no more than 15 000 per applicant for e85 infrastructure and 10 000 for biodiesel infrastructure may be awarded
8373984 i got a ton of help from the governors office
8373985 i received federal grants for half the cost and the write off from the state
8373986 with very few exceptions sales of e85 have grown each and every quarter
8373987 preliminary results show that e85 sales in the state is trending over 1 2 million gallons a month
8373988 it takes millions of dollars to do many of these things and we understand that the u s doe is doing a lot of different kinds of testing that will answer some of the questions about durability and the rest of the emissions testing
8373989 now were going to the next level with those plants to look specifically at what makes the most sense for those facilities
8373990 weve been determining the life cycle of the equipment the reliability performance and the efficiency of the dry fractionation portion and we now have that information and were comfortable with it were comfortable enough to say weve done enough research and monitoring to take it to market
8373991 you will always have a wide variation in starch based on the particular hybrid the type of corn being grown that wont change the ability to understand it with infrared technology and such that both monsanto and dupont have come out with the ability to understand the different varieties and different oil starch and protein concentrations will allow for selection and compensation to the farmer but its not something were doing today
8373992 what were trying to do in our front end fractionation technology is to maintain aiv standards food grade standards so options are not limited down the road so the plant can go food grade if say its location is right and the marketing opportunities at the particular site would allow production of a coproduct for sale to a food processor in the area
8373993 if the plant has the cleaning and separation equipment and everything else they can pull off a stream of corn grits or meal for that purpose if youve got a food grade front end youd have that opportunity were trying to keep the most options open to our customers
8373994 at the moment were bumping up against the upper end of that range
8373995 i dont think there are a whole lot of folks that feel it should be higher than that simply because theres nothing happening in the exit markets right now this is not an easy time to be investing
8373996 i havent seen a lot of activity by venture capitalists nor do i hear a lot of interest by venture capitalists right now in traditional corn based ethanol production
8373997 venture capitalists are typically looking for brand new technologies to bring to market and with the current corn based ethanol market appearing to mature they are now exploring other markets
8373998 temporarily youre seeing an increase in later stage venture capital dollars being put into cleantech and cellulosic ethanol companies because the ipo window is temporarily closed
8373999 everybody is seeing that as a means of waiting out the turmoil in the stock market to make sure that when the ipo gets out there theres an open set of investors or a possible acquisition offer
8374000 many of us had been doing our own splash blending for some time
8374001 we knew at the time of the installation it was a ground breaking situation and we certainly had no idea what lay ahead of us
8374002 well set them up so unleaded and e10 are always in a separate hose away from the higher blends of ethanol
8374003 by making sure we never run e85 in the same hose as the straight unleaded or e10 weve eliminated that problem
8374004 ill never forget a girl like you youre a piece of heaven
8374005 por esa raz n todo el mundo en el golfo necesita monitorear la tormenta

8374008 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8374009 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8374010 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8374011 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in
8374012 there is not so much opportunity at the present time for jean marie le pen even though ideally the context is for him because there is discontent dissatisfaction with the economic situation
8374013 the problems is hes getting old their leader jean marie le pen and the party is completely divided on his succession will it be his daughter marine le pen who has appeal of the media but the old party members contest her leadership so thats a real problem whats going to happen there and also for quite a while the party has been dwindling down to nothing and there is a moment when you cannot win elections when there is no staff behind you when the activists are gone
8374014 we are united in our view that her actions over the last two weeks have been damaging not just to international stability but also to the respect with which russia and the trust that russia holds around the world
8374015 we both want to defend international rules that respect the sovereignty the integrity and the democracy of nation states
8374016 im sure there are other cases of hidden people in the rural areas
8374017 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8374018 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8374019 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8374020 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8374021 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8374022 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8374023 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8374024 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8374025 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8374026 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8374027 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8374028 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8374029 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8374030 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8374031 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8374032 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8374033 i had really a good day last thursday in toronto and then it felt terrible
8374034 its much better today the neck locked up for a couple of days
8374035 the signs are we are going in the right direction thats why we got the mris to see whats going on
8374036 if it continues to progress in the right direction the guys in the trainers room know what to do well just take it a day at a time
8374037 what makes this place so special i dont think is the building its whats happened in this stadium so many great players and great teams have come through here
8374038 any team can erect monuments the reason those monuments are up is because theyre great players thats no secret but were moving what 100 yards the only difference from where i sit their payroll will probably go up a bunch more make it harder for us
8374039 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8374040 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8374041 youve got to make sure to take the same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8374042 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8374043 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8374044 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8374045 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8374046 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8374047 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8374048 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8374049 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8374050 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8374051 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8374052 the ideal scenario will be sometime at the end of this year we will have results at the pilot scale level
8374053 and then we can actually decide how we will transfer this technology to either industries or find some way to commercialize this technology
8374054 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts
8374055 they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
8374056 my group is interested in designing a new kind of nano porous material and this kind of material has a very huge surface area
8374057 if you can take advantage of this huge surface area you can jam pack a lot of these catalytic species into very small volume per unit volume you can achieve a lot of catalytic events
8374058 it is on the mind of every nebraskan its on the minds of every american
8374059 corn based ethanol is going to be around for a long time
8374060 i dont have any doubt about it its going to be there its the foundation in terms of what we are doing with ethanol and with each plant we are getting more efficient every single day
8374061 ethanol is and must remain a part of americans plan to reduce its dependence on foreign oil
8374062 america must become energy independent and an expanded ethanol industry in one step in that process
8374063 ethanol is the fuel of revolution and we are the fuel for the revolution
8374064 we have fueled a revolution to make gasoline the alternative fuel
8374065 we need to power our vehicles on more ethanol not less and do it sooner not later
8374066 i can stand here confidently before you today and say that it is no longer if we are able to produce cellulosic ethanol but when
8374067 americas corn belt has enough cobs to produce 5 billion gallons of ethanol per year
8374068 thats 5 billion gallons of fuel that comes from an agricultural waste rather than imported from opec
8374069 abie nathan died several hours ago in hospital he was hospitalised several days ago in a very bad condition
8374070 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with special colours of humanity and compassion we will cherish his memory with love
8374071 he was a warrior for peoples hearts and the greatest believer in times of little hope

8374079 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8374080 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8374081 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8374082 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8374083 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8374084 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8374085 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8374086 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8374087 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8374088 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8374089 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
8374090 i am cloud computing because my mail is now on gmail zomg
8374091 cloud computing is grid technology rebranded with a new buzzword
8374092 ajax is dhtml and we had it in the 90s
8374093 we respect healthy competition and nobody can match us in connectivity
8374094 for us india is an incredibly important market and we will do all for the convenience of passengers rather than bothering about competition
8374095 we have rectified all the problem at t5 since it opened in march and all of our flights from india would be handled out of t5 by october
8374096 we are planning to launch the personal video recorder which is available in countries such as us uk and australia in this calendar year to enable indian viewers to record their programmes and watch them when they want
8374097 mehra added that tata sky has set a target of having eight million subscribers by 2012 he estimated the indian dth market to grow to 30 35 million subscribers by 2012
8374098 we are not targeting customers who neither hold an existing credit card with any bank nor are our banks existing customer
8374099 additionally we are now focusing more on high end customers for premium cards
8374100 hdfc that was already focusing on internal customers has enhanced its focus on them for new cards
8374101 of our total 4 5 million existing customers 70 per cent have at least one relationship with the bank
8374102 that percentage has now gone up to 85 per cent for all new additions
8374103 dell is focused on early adopters and large customers about 50 worldwide to provide optimized servers storage and data center infrastructure
8374104 cloud computing is still an emerging market with standards across the framework and software stack still emerging we are trying to promote an ecosystem to build the software stack on top of the infrastructure you will gradually and judiciously see us add capabilities up and down the stack
8374105 dell is doing the most aggressive things possible to optimize for cloud computing
8374106 we think dell is perhaps the furthest along and we see them as a thought leader
8374107 what we have seen in the landscape is that most server providers are trying to provide lexus quality products at a toyota price we are looking for scion products at a scion price
8374108 vendors have to be creative around power and airflow optimization the cost of operating the hardware is key you have to take down the operating cost not just the server cost
8374109 if you do come along there is a small chance you could get arrested
8374110 im being totally serious i love this opera the more i hear it the more i love it part of it is that its a contemporary approach to opera which is different from the classics the more i see older operas the more i like this one
8374111 its great because you do have many things in common that are unique because of canada that are non american that are not anywhere else
8374112 its an understanding its a very different temperament that we have in canada and its very congenial i spend a lot of time explaining to americans well i used to i dont do it so much anymore why we are in fact quite different
8374113 we didnt have a civil war we didnt have a revolution we didnt have slavery people dont own guns and those are really serious cultural differences in the evolution of our countries which have led to very different attitudes to health to the social net the idea that you take care of other people and you dont just look out for yourself
8374114 i can sense the differences when i go back and forth
8374115 going to vancouver you kind of find your grounding again
8374116 when we did the fly in the 80s i was heavily into italian opera the release of the fly in italy was called la mosca and i saw it in florence and i thought this should be staged as an opera then i started thinking about the characters and dreaming about it so the idea was really hatched around the time of the film in the 80s and its been a wonderful journey ive enjoyed every part of it bringing together different artists from different mediums was wonderful
8374117 devastated very disappointed very hurt this is somebody that has been part of the league for a long time

8374145 el equipo se ha construido con su benepl cito y por tanto no han intervenido el rea deportiva no ha notado su presencia y adem s su colaboraci n con el club est siendo muy grande
8374146 tenemos asegurada la viabilidad del club es seguro que los pagos se har n puntualmente y la gente cobrar sus sueldos sin problemas trataremos de solucionar el tema de la concursal lo antes posible desde que entramos en el proceso la deuda se ha reducido en cinco millones de euros aproximadamente
8374147 siempre dijimos que hay tres pilares indispensables caixanova el concello y las aportaciones de la junta directiva mientras no se produzca el convenio con caixanova no se puede proceder a la firma del convenio con el concello pero estoy seguro de que cuando llegue el momento podremos firmar juntas todas las partes y transmitir la sensaci n de que todas las instituciones de la ciudad apoyamos al celta y lo vamos a sacar adelante entre todos
8374148 podemos nombrar a una serie de jugadores como trashorras con el que ten amos un convenio de palabra desde hac a bastante tiempo y pese a tener ofertas de primera cumpli su palabra noguerol otro jugador que quiso venir al celta de vigo por encima de todo y podr amos poner muchos m s ejemplos como ghilas david rub n o el mismo borja oubi a todos ellos son jugadores que han venido o se han quedado en el celta por convicci n propia y por compromiso con el equipo esto va a marcar la diferencia respecto al a o pasado podremos ganar o podremos perder pero en el campo ya no se va a ver la desidia de antes
8374149 nos sentimos muy discriminados por la tvg no quisieron retransmitir el ciudad de vigo a pesar de que estaba en el convenio firmado han rechazado renovarlo despu s de haberlo acordado y adem s tienen una deuda econ mica con nosotros en este momento estamos en una situaci n de espera complicada
8374150 el que quiera ganar a este celta va a tener que correr mucho eso va a entusiasmar a la afici n porque se va a encontrar con un equipo que lucha los noventa minutos como si fueran los ltimos
8374151 el ndice de abonos est siendo bueno solamente un poco inferior al del a o pasado por estas fechas el club quiere que los que sean socios lo sean a conciencia y acudan siempre que puedan a balaidos para animar a su equipo
8374152 este es un a o cargado de mucha ilusi n tenemos unas esperanzas muy grandes depositadas en el equipo no por el hecho de conseguir o no el ascenso si no porque creo que hemos hecho un conjunto capaz de enganchar a la afici n motivado y con el que el celta recupera la filosof a de amar el escudo la camiseta y una forma especial de sentir el celta
8374153 no vamos a aceptar la voluntad de todos los jugadores que no quieran estar en el celta y darles la carta de libertad el club tiene que sacar siempre algo de provecho nuestra filosof a es clara solamente van a estar en el celta aquellos futbolistas que est n implicados porque los que no lo est n tienen muy poco recorrido en este club
8374154 va a ser un a o complicado estamos en un proceso concursal la deuda sigue ah estamos en segunda y el a o pasado no fue bueno pero creo que este a o con la ayuda de todos de la prensa del aficionado haremos un equipo capaz de vencer siempre
8374155 da un poco de rabia que el partido del s bado s lo lo vi ramos dos mil personas porque realmente fue una delicia ojal hubiera estado toda la afici n porque ese partido nos alegr la semana y se la habr a alegrado a cualquiera quien vaya el s bado a balaidos va a salir mucho m s contento que al entrar
8374156 posiblemente falta por llegar un jugador lo ideal ser a un central que pueda jugar de mediocentro si se le necesita pero ya que tambi n tenemos a vila que es mediocentro y ha cumplido perfectamente como central podr a ser que llegara un futbolista que solamente se desenvolviera como medio centro o como central
8374157 el celta tiene la absoluta seguridad de que oubi a va a jugar aqu toda la temporada el jugador est encantado de estar en el club y nosotros queremos que pueda reaparecer cuanto antes
8374158 eso con cualquier jugador si un club viene con una cantidad que el celta estime oportuna la contemplaremos pero puedo asegurar casi al cien por cien que oubi a jugar esta temporada en el celta
8374159 no se ha notado la presencia de los agentes concursales en el rea deportiva
8374160 en algunos aspectos incluso ha venido bien al club como por ejemplo que ten amos un tope salarial al que limitarnos si no lo hubiera habido quiz nos habr amos visto tentados a excedernos por traer a alg n jugador en concreto
8374161 estar en segunda nos ha supuesto alg n disgusto con jugadores que ten amos casi cerrados y en el ltimo momento se fueron a equipos de primera siempre hay dificultades pero creo que al final se ha confeccionado una plantilla lo suficientemente buena para ser optimistas
8374162 hubo casos de jugadores importantes a los que no fichamos porque despu s de haber estado negociando con ellos no mostraban el suficiente inter s y compromiso con el proyecto jugadores importantes que acataban venir con cierta desgana por no encontrar algo que para ellos fuera mejor

8374291 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8374292 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8374293 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8374294 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8374295 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8374296 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8374297 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8374298 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8374299 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8374300 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8374301 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8374329 fsb reports to prime minister putin circulating in the kremlin today are stating that an israeli based plot to assassinate the united states democratic party presidential candidate barack obama has been foiled due to information relayed to american intelligence officials from russian military forces who are still decrypting secret documents captured in georgia from retreating georgian special forces troops trained in israel according to these reports russian forces had captured secret war documents and plans drawn up by former israeli brigadier general gal hirsch who commanded israels forces during their disastrous 2006 war in lebanon who resigned prior to his being investigated for his war failures and was in command of georgian military forces during their likewise disastrous invasion of russian protected south ossetia

8374337 the government printing offices decision to export the work has proved lucrative allowing the agency to book more than 100 million in recent profits by charging the state department more money for blank passports than it actually costs to make them according to interviews with federal officials and documents obtained by the times the profits have raised questions both inside the agency and in congress because the law that created gpo as the federal governments official printer explicitly requires the agency to break even by charging only enough to recover its costs

8374369 once the system is built and operational amaizing energy will own 100 percent of the oil
8374370 as amaizing energy takes prudent steps toward becoming more of a bio refinery we saw primafuel solutions smaart oil system as a near term cost effective first step in moving our business in that direction
8374371 the first and most immediate benefit is the new revenue stream that is priority number one
8374372 many of primafuels technologies are built around their smaart oil system it gives amaizing energy a near term pathway toward further product and revenue diversification

8374375 to save america we need to break the oil monopoly to break the monopoly we need to create fuel choice as the economic disaster unfolds and middle east power grows by billions daily there is no time for further delay therefore citizens from across america and friends of liberty from around the world from every walk of life and every part of the political spectrum are gathering in des moines september 13 14 to form an organization dedicated to fight this fight and win this battle
8374376 dedicated to inventing and proving new technologies to advance humanitys reach into space and to improve life on earth
8374377 we need your help to push the u s congress to pass a law requiring that new cars sold in the united states will be flex fuel vehicles the technology is readily available and costs about 100 per vehicle this law the open fuel standard act has already been introduced in the senate s3303 and the house of representatives h6559
8374378 by making flex fuel the american standard we can open the fuel market worldwide as all foreign car makers would be impelled to convert their lines over as well around the globe gasoline would be forced to compete at the pump against alcohol fuels made from any number of sources including not only corn and sugar but cellulosic ethanol made from crop residues and weeds as well as methanol which can be made from any kind of biomass as well as coal natural gas and recycled urban trash
8374379 believes in an even handed system of tax credits that will remain in place until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers dollars
8374380 there is no easier or more direct way to prove to the world that we will no longer be subject to the whims of others than to expand our production capabilities
8374381 create market competition by allowing u s blenders to purchase cheaper ethanol from foreign sources u s oil companies are using ethanol merely as a blending component in gasoline rather than a true alternative transportation fuel
8374382 would help lower gas prices increase the supply of ethanol to coastal markets and ease the economic strain that is impacting the agriculture food and beverage industries
8374383 there isnt enough foreign produced ethanol to enter into the united states such that we could use it as a primary fuel
8374384 only 1 528 of the nearly 180 000 retail gasoline stations in the u s offer e85
8374385 even the brazilians state that they dont have enough ethanol to do that
8374386 while alleging an oversupply of corn ethanol u s oil companies still import thousands of barrels of ethanol from foreign sources every month without having to pay the 54 cents per gallon import tariff
8374387 ethanol must compete against rather than be an inexpensive blending component in gasoline

8374417 there is you know we want to go out there and have a good showing we want the first team try and go out there and get some points when we have the ball we need to get some confidence going into the next week to get ready for the season opener
8374418 no you cant play like that if you start playing to not get hurt thats usually when you get hurt were going to go out there and whether we get one series or three series were going to go out there and try to score points whatever means necessary
8374419 obviously last week isnt what we wanted to do we wanted to go out there score some points and win the game it didnt work out that way but weve corrected the things we did wrong and we just have to go out and play were still confident we still think were going to be a good offense so were not down on ourselves
8374420 you know for that night and that day we kind of did but were back to where we need to be it might have been good for us as a young team we might have thought too much of ourselves after the first two weeks so it might have been good for us
8374421 i would imagine that would depend on how we do on the first series if we go out there and do what were supposed to do i would imagine we get one or two series but if not well probably keep going
8374422 we dont think were that far off of it well play as much as they want us to play if they want us to play a series or they want us to play a quarter no matter how long youre out there you want to go out there and move the ball and score points if we can get on track and get going on one drive then that will be it
8374423 yeah we feel good about where were at we feel good about what weve done in the preseason last week wasnt what we wanted but youre going to get that sometimes we feel good and were ready to start the season
8374424 thats what this is all about were all just trying to get on the same page were all trying to get more and more familiar with each other weve had a good camp we feel good about it we feel good about the offense and everything thats going on so its just going to be a matter of us continuing to build on what weve done and get better every week
8374425 thats my job i make sure everyone is in the right spot if youre running the wrong depth the wrong route then as an offense youre not going to click thats the thing about offense everybodys got to be doing the same thing defense can get away with a couple busts here and there offense you cant so were trying to limit as many mistakes as possible
8374426 yeah theyre getting better and better we know were going to get man coverage and we just have to beat it
8374427 there was some miscommunication some on my end some on theirs but thats the good thing about preseason it doesnt count its basically a glorified practice we come back in the film room and correct it

8374433 as the state purchases new vehicles for its fleet more and more of our cars trucks and vans will run on alternative fuels
8374434 with these new e85 facilities well continue to make marylands transportation fleet less dependant on fossil fuels strengthening the energy future of our state for generations to come
8374435 our commitment to strengthening our sustainable future for our children is evident in the investments we make
8374436 maryland will stand up for the environment and future generations by investing in sound renewable energy policies like the construction of facilities like these
8374437 greater use of e 85 and other renewable fuels can help us do that with 1 200 flex fuel vehicles already in the states fleet we are striving to reduce reliance on fossil fuel and its harmful impacts on the environment
8374438 by reducing our reliance on foreign oil maryland can advance our economic security our national security and our environmental security at the same time

8374442 with more tickets sold for this years damnation festival in the first month than we managed in the whole of last year it was a simple choice lock out the fans or take the plunge and add the huge 2 000 capacity refectory will now host three stages rammed with talent and were delighted to welcome rock sound on board as our newest partners theyve been at the forefront of breaking bands for over a decade and we pride ourselves on doing the same
8374443 who am i to complain about the bad when there is so much to be grateful for
8374444 huckabee jokes that republicans have called in pat robertson to pray hurricane gustav off the coast
8374445 were taking some of what we started and taking it to more depth
8374446 we really want to continue to explore information about price discovery and value discovery in distillers grains markets we want to continue to examine pricing methods that are being used so that we can get a better perspective on how these things are being valued
8374447 with narrow margins in the ethanol industry the value proposition of distillers grains for ethanol producers is certainly much more important than it used to be
8374448 how that product is being valued relative to other feed ingredient sources is really important to some extent we want to see whether the protein component value of distillers grains is consistent with its protein content relative to its substitution potential
8374449 we understand that the different ethanol production processes result in sometimes quite different byproducts
8374450 ultimately if i was to look at it in a broader sense as an economist what we are really interested in is the potential global market development and price risk management tools that are needed
8374451 we think that there is some considerable global market potential for a product that has as high a protein as this distillers grains product tends to have but also we recognize that there is a lot of variability depending upon the method used to create that product
8374452 the q microbe has exhibited great versatility in converting a wide variety of non food biomass feedstocks to ethanol
8374453 we are pleased that research that began in the microbiology labs at university of massachusetts amherst may change the way we fuel our vehicles around the globe
8374454 senator obama has been quite clear in his support for renewable energy and specifically for biofuels
8374455 senator mccain on the other hand would be horrible for ethanol
8374456 he has repeatedly called for the elimination of the partial tax exemption for renewable alcohols which would be a tax increase on the only alternative fuel we produce in the u s in any significant quantity he has always had it in for ethanol although he changed his position briefly in order to get through the iowa primaries but then went back to opposing it make no mistake mccain would be a worse anti ethanol president than reagan who eventually came around and supported it but called for the repeal of the tax incentive for years before he gave up
8374457 both presidential candidates have addressed the issue of mandatory production of flex fuel vehicles ffvs but it takes more than cars
8374458 candidates who are serious about lessening our dependence on foreign oil and enhancing national security need to be unwavering and unapologetic when it comes to sound renewable energy policy
8374459 income from the companys ethanol joint ventures also rose during the quarter
8374460 grain business benefited from significantly improved margins on grain sales and the more than doubling of service fee income
8374461 both our plant nutrient and grain amp ethanol groups contributed significantly to our income during that period
8374462 adms 2008 results demonstrate the ability of our people to leverage our global assets against an exceptional set of opportunities
8374463 we had an outstanding year highlighted by record segment operating profit adm met the needs of food feed fuel and industrial customers even as strong demand for crops and commodities challenged the global supply chain
8374464 vai fregatene fai quel che vuoi come vuoi con accanto chi vuoi non badare a quello che dice la gente a come lo dice non fermarti a cercare qualcosa di cui non sei certo credi nellicertezza ma non tralasciare le cose certe pensa che le cose nuove potrebbero essere belle e importanti come quelle che gi conosci pensa che tu sei come sei e gli altri sono come sono e x fortuna non siamo tutti uguali cogli le occasioni per essere felice apprezza quello che ti fa felice anche se non sai se domani o unora dopo lo sarai ancora fermati ogni tanto e pensa che anche solo vedere il sole che sorge puo riempire di felicit qualcuno magari qualcuno che vede quasi sempre solo il buio ma soprattutto ricordati di non smettere di sognare e di sperare

8374467 we have several conferences coming up this fall including the third annual international distillers grains conference and tradeshow and the world biofuels symposium in beijing
8374468 certainly one of the most exciting is the advanced biofuels workshop and tradeshow being held in minneapolis sept 28 30
8374469 we are pleased to announce this financing resource as it enhances our liquidity and supports the continued growth of our marketing business
8374470 it allows us to weather the storm of a tough ethanol market
8374471 solely a marketing device for a potential joint venture between the defendants and not a corporate or legal entity with experience or ability in the design and construction of ethanol plants
8374472 based on the dissolution of the bio renewable group in december 2006
8374473 along the way bio renewable group said the price was going to be a little bit higher and they kind of quantified that maybe it would be 5 percent to 10 percent or so high because building materials were rising and so forth
8374474 when we finally got our formal estimate from them it was about 204 million and it didnt even include the railroad track and some of the other things that were in the first 110 million assessment so we fired them and then we got some other quotes after that in the range of 110 million
8374475 we tested this technology in depth for the past ten years
8374476 bluefire selected amalgamated research because they employ a patented fractal distribution system that improves the critical flow profile of the fluids to be separated thereby improving the efficiency of separation by another couple of percent
8374477 however at the new location the plant will still utilize landfill residues from the riverside and san bernardino counties which was in the original plans
8374478 has forced india to depend on other countries for fuel oil increasing the risk exposure of the country to the volatility of crude oil prices in the international market

8374513 martin was one of the nations first and most visible lesbian rights activists who dedicated her life to combating homophobia sexism violence and racism
8374514 martins many contributions to the lgbt movement will resonate for decades to come
8374515 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8374516 what a country in which a two bit college teacher smarmy hypocrite and serial wife dumper gets to be a
8374517 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8374518 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8374519 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8374520 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8374521 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8374522 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis

8374529 pudimos comprobar que cuatro peleadores que hab an firmado contrato para tomar parte de la funci n denominada alianza azteca no se presentaron y en dicho documento se estipulaba claramente la fecha de la funci n y el peso en que deber an presentarse
8374530 uno de los peleadores se presento tarde a la funci n de pesaje y con cerca de ocho kilos por encima del l mite estipulado en el contrato por lo cual no participo en el evento otros dos optaron por participar en un evento en la ciudad de hermosillo sonora
8374531 y un cuarto simplemente no le gusto el rival a su entrenador en este caso los cuatro contratos fueron firmados por el entrenador de ellos ra l arvizu por lo cual l tambi n se har acreedor de una sanci n por parte nuestra
8374532 los peleadores son profesionales todos llevan por lo menos cuatro peleas en su carrera y cuando se firma un contrato ya es un compromiso oficial en caso de sufrir alguna lesi n o enfermedad como en el caso de edgar medina nuestro m dicos deben certificarlos
8374533 y ellos determinar s en realidad puede o no participar el peleador y en el caso del otro peleador mariscar presentarse casi 8 kilos arriba del peso estipulado no tiene justificaci n y mucho menos con contrato firmado

8374555 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8374556 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8374557 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8374558 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8374559 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8374560 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8374561 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8374562 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time

8374598 since the smoke free regulations were brought in over a year ago there have been very few cases where we have had to resort to issuing fixed penalty notices
8374599 that in part is due to the large amount of publicity there has been about the regulations and the fact that most people realise that the laws are there for a good reason to protect public health
8374600 nobody has an excuse in saying that they are not aware of the implications of the regulations and we will continue to take action where we have evidence that they are being broken

8374651 a high 85 3 percent of respondents said they were delighted or very delighted with the power of the green machines they experienced clearly indicating that fun and green can go together

8374660 ributto in mare le stelle marine altrimenti muoiono tutte sulla spiaggia
8374661 ma ci sono migliaia di stelle marine su questa spiaggia non puoi certo salvarle tutte sono troppe
8374662 e questo succede su centinaia di altre spiagge lungo la costa non puoi cambiare le cose
8374663 my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness
8374664 whoever drinks of this water will thirst again but whoever drinks of the water that i shall give him will never thirst
8374665 let no man impose those things upon you for god has not imposed them if god has made you free be not you again entangled in that yoke of bondage the festive atmosphere of those five months in honolulu was simply spontaneous was popular in the media at the time
8374666 the intent was never to create controversy to make political statements or to be on the avant garde of the movie world let alone to offend significant members of our community
8374667 obviously we missed the mark with our choice of breakfast at tiffanys in the end we felt it was better to go with a movie that hopefully everyone can enjoy
8374668 tiffanys is considered one of the most racist anti asian films in u s film history
8374669 to screen tiffanys in a city sponsored event for entertainment would be tantamount to the city condoning racism
8374670 jag hade hoppats att m ndagen skulle m tta men nu r det i alla fall bara din kuk i mig och dina h nder p min kropp i mitt huvud hela tiden
8374671 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8374672 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8374673 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8374674 i am happy to announce the signing of joe sakic to a one year contract
8374675 our entire organization is very excited to have joe back for another season as the only captain of the avalanche his record of achievement speaks for itself having him return is great for our franchise and community but also for the game of hockey
8374676 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8374677 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8374678 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8374679 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community

8374687 se indica que la mayor dificultad que enfrenta el sector no son las deudas tributarias y previsionales sino las condiciones que imponen los grandes clientes
8374688 cuando un trabajador se sindicaliza se hace efectivo su traspaso a alguna de estas razones sociales a trav s del finiquito de traslado en la legislaci n laboral no existe el finiquito de traslado pero s en esta empresa al traspasar a los trabajadores a otra raz n social se deja sin base social al sindicato y despu s se resuelve el tema v a entendimiento con los dirigentes
8374689 porque se va un trabajador full time y llegan dos o tres part time por el mismo sueldo lo cual debilita al movimiento sindical
8374690 si un recepcionista gana 441 mil pesos en economax el empresario lo despide y luego lo contrata por un sueldo de 180 mil pesos es decir por el valor de un trabajador que gana 400 mil pesos pueden contratar a dos trabajadores se est n especializando en contratar mano de obra barata

8374702 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8374703 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8374704 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8374705 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8374706 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8374707 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8374708 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8374709 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8374710 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8374711 for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and do not return there but water the earth and make it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater 11 so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish what i please and it shall prosper in the thing for which i sent it
8374712 all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass the grass withers and its flower falls away 25 but the word of the lord endures forever
8374713 do not think that i came to destroy the law or the prophets i did not come to destroy but to fulfill 18 for assuredly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled
8374714 i will make a deal with you i will give you this book if you promise to read every page before you smoke it
8374715 about 15 years ago he tried to sell me a new testament when i refused to buy it he gave it to me even though i told him i would use the pages to roll cigarettes

8374719 7you shall speak my words to them whether they hear or whether they refuse for they are rebellious 8but you son of man hear what i say to you do not be rebellious like that rebellious house open your mouth and eat what i give you
8374720 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth 19 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit 20 teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age

8374725 when we began the development of visonac we were seeking to provide a much improved treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne the results from these two studies clearly highlight that we are well on our way to achieving this goal the fact that we have been able to deliver good efficacy results with visonac while at the same time reducing pain and redness will be of major benefit to patients the second study which has demonstrated that we can simplify the overall treatment procedure with visonac while delivering equivalent efficacy is expected to help increase the penetration of visonac pdt into the overall acne market we look forward to confirming these positive findings in our phase iii program for visonac

8374733 weve come face to face with the new reality but if in fact in order to respond to that reality we have to alter our civil liberties change the way we function then we truly have lost the war the way to conduct the war is to demonstrate that our institutions are functioning that your civil liberties your civil rights your ability to be free and walk and move around in fact are not fundamentally altered there are a lot of things we can do though to diminish significantly the possibility of this happening again without changing our character as a nation
8374734 i think that we should be calm those of us who hold high public office just calm down a little bit collect our thoughts collect the information in a methodical way analyze what we know happened and what we can derive from that this nation is too big too strong too united too much a power in terms of our cohesion and our values to let this break us apart
8374735 senator biden says one of the most profound things about all this which weve said several times this morning which the terrorist wins when he or she manages to alter the behavior of a people or infringes on the way of life in a country that the country a democratic country particularly alters its way of life because thats a step up for the terrorist in question because it raises the whole question of civil liberties and access and freedom of movement
8374736 the continuous sharp decline in share prices can have implications for the wider financial system
8374737 with this in mind the board decided to place a floor based on closing prices of securities on wednesday
8374738 the individual security prices will remain free to trade within the normal circuit breaker limits but not below the floor price level as mentioned
8374739 its going to be a good news at least for a short time because the market was constantly going down
8374740 in the meantime the authorities should work on long term measures to boost sentiment perhaps they should have done it earlier
8374741 there are some more people getting involved and we will forward the details once they join
8374742 i was roped in as the head of cricket as i was under the impression that they wanted mumbai ideas but i was asked to do managerial job
8374743 we were all supposed to be with hyderabad team for three years but there was as clause that allowed us to be removed with a notice none of us took it seriously perhaps the owners felt that by changing the support staff they could solve the problems
8374744 as a youngster all i wanted was to play for sri lanka
8374745 i remember when i got my first call up for the national team it was a one dayer against india in rajkot i had just turned 20 and arjuna ranatunga gave me the new ball ahead of the others navjot sidhu was my first wicket and that was after he had blasted a hundred
8374746 there have been a few good performances along the way but winning the world cup remains the greatest memory
8374747 vaas conceded that he was not the most naturally gifted cricketer and put his success down to honest hard work
8374748 there were a lot of guys more talented than me my game was limited but i worked harder
8374749 nothing comes easy to you youve got to make most of your talent i work hard on my game
8374750 wasim was a very clever bowler he was lethal and more often than not outsmarted the batsmen waqar was entirely different the two of them together made life miserable for batsmen soon murali will go past wasims record as the highest wicket taker in odis
8374751 he has limited abilities but he has made the most of it over time with slower deliveries bowling different angles taking the pace off the ball he is an intelligent bowler
8374752 all the years of hard work you put in are for moments like this its hard to explain in words how you feel im getting goose bumps watching vaas get to 400 so you can imagine what it must have felt like when i crossed the milestone
8374753 vaasys is a huge contribution especially in the sub continent it is not an easy task to go on for so long and be consistent
8374754 he and murali have done the job for us for quite some time now
8374755 we will constitute one in two three days and the camp for the same will start off immediately we will call a meeting for the same shortly
8374756 what do you mean the camp is not on its already happening
8374757 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8374784 weve seen reports that there are atrocities being committed against civilians
8374785 and we want to call on the russians to allow a credible investigation to take place of reports that atrocities have been committed by both sides
8374786 and we want to make sure that the international community is able to investigate these charges because we all take them very seriously
8374787 europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part

8374877 im gonna vote for hillary im a clinton delegate and she hasnt released me yet
8374878 theres no need for it its over its been over we all knew it but some of us havent given up the ghost yet
8374879 i think youll find overwhelming support for sen obama in this delegation
8374880 everyone should have heard her by now loud and clear that the job going forward is to work for the election of obama
8374881 id like to see the entire delegation support obama it would be a very strong signal
8374882 the campaigns have determined how this is going to work
8374883 i understand that the clinton delegates want to serve their constituents that is what im doing but i dont want this to be a hollow victory for obama
8374884 i think its part of the healing process i think after tonights vote were going to be a united party and support obama
8374885 we know there are delegates loyal to clinton its ok its part of the process

8374905 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume

8374926 well you know what african americans are not going to get out and vote
8374927 its ludicrous on the face of it you can ask the candidates who i have worked with because its not true
8374928 not only do we stand by our story but we can prove it
8374929 when i asked mr lawson about that statement he denied making that statement and more importantly than that i have not witnessed or heard anything that would lead me to believe that he is conducting an alternative campaign to do as such and ill share with you unequivocally that as chair i would not tolerate that here locally
8374930 if you look at the purpose of the african american caucus it was designed to give african americans a voice within the party if you take a look at the local political dynamics now you have an african american chair for the first time in 20 years i bring to the table the diversity here locally
8374931 plus michael lawson is working here locally to still accomplish the mission of the aac and so its working out actually in a positive way
8374932 they have kevin smith whos not even a member of any aac in the state of north carolina thats just like arnold schwarzenegger becoming president of the united states and he wasnt even born here
8374933 were going to be distributing fliers to that effect throughout the counties
8374934 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8374935 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8374936 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8374937 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8374938 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8374939 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8374940 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8374941 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8374942 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8374943 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game
8374944 this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest
8374945 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8374946 a submarine is a special type of container whose shape resembles the traditional bottles of early korean ceramics

8374950 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
8374951 if you have a green party i want to join
8374952 it is critical for the hip hop generation and young people among whom only one in fourteen vote or participate in elections and who see the current two party system as antiquated and unable to address their issues to be able to hear other alternatives at all political debates so they can have informed voter choice and become engaged in real democracy the green party ticket represents something my generation can vote for not just an alternative but an imperative this push to have third party and independent voices in national and local debates helps all of us to make democracy work
8374953 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
8374954 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
8374955 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it

8374958 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid

8374960 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8374961 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain

8374965 gentlemen im chrysanthus owner of this estate and representative of the islands farmers my i welcome you and invite your officers to dinner this evening the foods fresh and incorporates exotic fruits and vegetables found only here in this sanctuary by the will of abraxus
8374966 wed be delighted to join you and perhaps you can give us news of the saxon raiders that have plagued this coast
8374967 there may soon come a time when britannias troops will need to save the west from barbarian assault as you may have heard our army is already lobbying to raise the british commander maximus as co emperor so he can assist gratian in keeping order
8374968 your maximus sounds as like a force to be reckoned with flavius
8374969 emperor gratian must be pleased to have such a loyal and capable leader at his back lifes simple here were protected from saxon raiders by abraxus whos loved by all our people
8374970 i have a delicate question for you chrysanthus maximus asked me to enquire about helen a young woman who once owned this estate hed been in regular communication with her up until four months ago when her writing became incoherent he hoped to visit himself but has been too busy with affairs of state
8374971 yes my cousin inherited this estate but abraxus appeared to me in a vision and revealed helens succession had been manipulated by saxon demons and when i embraced the love of abraxus as our ancestors had and confronted her she went mad
8374972 her maid tends her on the small island at the other side of the harbour but abraxus has whispered to me that evil saxon spirits still spy on us through her eyes so each week when i don the cock headed hood of abraxus and slay a tormented bull in the town square i call upon mithras and all the celtic gods who are servants of abraxus to help cleanse her of evil when i have finished i share out the sacrificial meat so the common people can pray for her too you will be able to marvel at the wonders of abraxus yourself tomorrow at noon
8374973 have you ever tasted greek firewater decimus i though it might get us into the mood for playing the old wooden horse trick with equus i look forward to fooling the pirates into thinking were guiding a helpless merchantman so your special explorates can surprise them with the hidden catapults
8374974 as chrysanthus says vectis is never attacked yet within one days sail of here traders of all nationalities are taken as regularly as the click of a water clock wilf thinks theres a spy here but his saxon trader contacts couldnt supply a name wilf was once a chief you know he surrendered to me in exchange for the lives of his men and now theres a bond between us it was he who persuaded me to investigate in person have you ever been in love decimus
8374975 its late and my poor head is becoming confused did i miss something
8374976 many years ago helen saved my life i was caught on a beach near here by saxon pillagers she picked them off one by one with her hunting bow from the cliff and has been in my dreams ever since now chrysanthus claims enemy spirits have turned her mind how can that be
8374977 personally sir i dont trust chrysanthus and all this abraxus rubbish give me the word and ill make him talk god or no god
8374978 no decimus that wouldnt be politic tomorrow you keep an eye on those visiting equus and ill make sure chrysanthus takes me to helen
8374979 maria is that you i feel like ive drunk an amphora of unwatered wine
8374980 they told us youd gone mad miss and thats why you had to be kept here and have the potions to calm your mind but last night they put something different in your water and they were laughing about how this would be an end to it i didnt know what to do so i poured it away when they werent looking ive been sitting all night waiting for you to wake now someones coming and im so dizzy and cold i think they must have poisoned me too
8374981 but thats where youre wrong again decimus theres a sleek saxon warboat in the bay waiting to transport you and the traitor to gratians court he pays well for the heads of usurpers and then i can continue taking my cut from the pirates in exchange for information theyll blame it all on helen of course everyone knows she is mad a spy and do you know what i wasnt even here right now i am slaying a bull in the town square dressed as abrax
8374982 when will you learn never to trust a saxon you really need someone to look after you

8375013 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
8375014 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
8375015 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
8375016 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world

8375026 within the democratic party obamas losses are primarily evident among the relatively small group that describes its political views as conservative
8375027 the 63 of conservative democrats supporting obama over mccain in aug 18 24 polling is the lowest obama has earned since he clinched the democratic nomination in june
8375028 the 78 of democrats backing obama from aug 18 24 ties for the lowest seen since early june
8375029 the 7 of republicans for obama is the lowest to date since the start of gallup poll daily tracking of the obama mccain race in march

8375117 una amenaza que afecta a todos los continentes por igual
8375118 i told my son back then that obama would be the first african american president
8375119 i havent felt so energized since 1968 presidential candidate eugene mccarthy trying to end the vietnam war
8375120 i want to tell obama that people want someone who can be accountable every year not every four years
8375121 obama has an appeal that is based on smartness common sense and logic
8375122 if obama suddenly changed his affiliation but kept all his values and principles in response to the issues but called himself a republican then i would pull the republican lever
8375123 it was during that time that i learned the power of protest and that one person can really make a difference
8375124 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
8375125 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
8375126 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
8375127 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
8375128 i definitely see that 6 ball snooker has the potential to make its mark but it needs to be packaged and marketed properly television coverage is a must for it to succeed
8375129 it is an exciting format as it produces quick results and there is not enough time for the player to think strategy and plan his game
8375130 till now only two tournaments have been held in 6 ball snooker and we need to hold a tournament on a larger scale with more participants and promote it so as to make it popular
8375131 it was a good tournament for us and i played very well and won all my three matches
8375132 for us security was never an issue pakistan is like a second home for us and karachi has been a lucky venue for me so we had no second thoughts about going and playing there

8375137 barack obama is striking back fiercely and swiftly to stamp out an ad that links him to a 1960s radical eager to demonstrate a far more aggressive response to attacks than john kerry did when faced with the 2004 swift boat campaign
8375138 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas big speech on thursday night will be delivered from an elaborate columned stage resembling a miniature greek temple the stage similar to structures used for rock concerts has been set up at the 50 yard line the midpoint of invesco field the stadium where the denver broncos national football league team plays
8375139 the road from kabul to kandahar is even more treacherous according to other drivers
8375140 suddenly one of the soldiers announced that they were looking for a suspect wearing an orange bandana who they suspected of planting roadside improvised explosive devices ieds at that the gis began forcing nearby pedestrians face first up against a wall and yelling at them to shut the fuck up one man was pinned to the ground in what looked like a stress position the police officers from denver and surrounding towns did nothing they had been informed days before one officer told me that the iraq veterans against the war ivaw were coming to town and preparing to engage in nonviolent street theater on tuesday and wednesday the scared pedestrians pinned to the wall and the sidewalk i learned were volunteers this was all just acting
8375141 the declaration makes only one reference to a country situation reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8375142 we are very pleased that a high percentage of bainbridge island students continue to perform very well on the wasl
8375143 we are especially pleased to note that the achievement level of our 10th grade students is among the highest in the state
8375144 you idiots do know that thats the invisible ing woman in there right
8375145 its kind of like picking up a dumped over bowl of spaghetti
8375146 we hope to have it buttoned up and dry before the real winter hits
8375147 i wish i kept a log theres been hundreds of accidents with that fence over the years
8375148 there have been a mixed combination of islanders a diversified group
8375149 there are some people we know and others we didnt its almost like our claim to fame
8375150 one night i went to see what happened and the boy in the passenger seat was just white he was so scared
8375151 a fence beam had gone through the window and was inches from his face
8375152 he would get the money to get the fence repaired and then he would go repair it himself that was his allowance so to speak
8375153 people ask what we are doing and were trying to make standards on the island so that we can provide emergency services
8375154 making sure roadways are wide enough and that we have enough water to fight a fire these are some of the changes
8375155 i guess the new code doesnt directly deal with it
8375156 what i mean by that is there are no retroactive provisions that are proposed we cant go in and enforce these requirements on buildings that met a pre existing code
8375157 if we have a fire the possibility could exist where we wouldnt have enough water to adequately control it
8375158 it does have an effect on property development developers must ensure that life saving safety requirements are complied with
8375159 the contractor can decide a development is not compatible with the current water flow in an area and have to move elsewhere
8375160 three things happen if things stay the way they are
8375161 it might create some restrictions on new development and construction and in the event of a fire we might not be available to gain control
8375162 as a communitys fire rating improves it can effect the actual insurance premiums
8375163 generally the lower our rating the lower the insurance premiums but companies arent required to lower their premiums when we make a change
8375164 the basic factors are looking at water supply fire hydrants and mains which is really out of fire stations control
8375165 so you can have a community that has a great fire department and a low water supply and really we look at those specific conditions in the community
8375166 when they changed the fire protection rating from a 7 to a 6 it really didnt impact home owners at all it just helped the commercial side of the picture
8375167 in my own personal opinion the fire protection on the island is excellent
8375168 but a better fire protection class would indeed have reductions though it will vary by company
8375169 if there is any development in the immediate future that development will see some of these changes we made
8375170 were going to continue to work provisions and helping to prepare for an event
8375171 as long as were all having a really good time and we can afford it well keep going
8375172 we have the opportunity at least to take a deep breath look around and enjoy and appreciate the place where we are and this time in our lives
8375173 i want to shrink the size of government to 1842 levels
8375174 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
8375175 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone

8375178 i havent been to a restaurant in recent memory where i didnt care what the bill was becuse the meal was so divine morimoto was the 1st in far too long

8375180 take another picture so i can post it on my myspace
8375181 well they want to know if they can join you
8375182 but actually now that i think about it they should have offered to buy you drinks right i know that is so tacky so maybe no maybe ill tell them that youre out because one of you is engaged who wants to be the engaged one how about you put the right on the other hand like they wouldnt even know and ill just tell them you are celebrating right it will be so funny
8375183 yeah like that works too el oh el oh by the way theres a 25 credit card minimum
8375184 no debe estigmatizarse al pueblo mapuche formado por chilenos pac ficos cuya prioridad es trabajar para sacar adelante a sus familias y cuya demanda fundamental es de respeto de parte de la sociedad y de soluci n a la profunda crisis que vive su peque a agricultura
8375185 cuando se empieza a develar la verdad en el sentido de que quienes est n tras estos hechos no estar an vinculados con integrantes directos de comunidades mapuches cobra mayor sentido mi llamado que tambi n es el del obispo de temuco monse or manuel camilo vial a que prensa y autoridades terminen con la perniciosa dial ctica de conflicto mapuche y de terroristas mapuches para situar los sucesos en el marco policial que corresponde y sacarlos de una buena vez del significado tnico que equivocadamente le han dado

8375190 were interested in bringing choice and innovation to the total end user experience
8375191 the design of your computer is as important as the design of your handbag or living room couch after all if a customer isnt attracted by a pc theyll never get to experience our software
8375192 we give these companies early feedback on the prototypes they show us and we help showcase some of the most fashionable pcs as we are here at project
8375193 its a two way street our partners are constantly encouraging us to be as innovative as we can be

8375195 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
8375196 the church says the earth is flat but i know that it is round for i have seen the shadow on the moon and i have more faith in a shadow than in the church
8375197 in short if god created the universe as a special place for humanity he seems to have wasted an awfully large amount of space where humanity will never make an appearance
8375198 so long as the universe had a beginning we could suppose it had a creator but if the universe is really completely self contained having no boundary or edge it would have neither beginning nor end it would simply be what place then for a creator

8375217 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8375218 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8375219 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8375220 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8375221 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had

8375227 i think im not letting my kids go down that slide anymore
8375228 we are a good fielding side and that is a plus point raina played well but it was disappointing that we both got out together and could not get runs in the end
8375229 you need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing jayasuriya gave us a good start but we did not back it up thushara has done very well with ball and bat
8375230 we should not take anything from india after winning the toss they put runs on the board we made a few errors on the way
8375231 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
8375232 i made clear above all that i would have expected that we would talk about these questions in international organisations before unilateral recognition happened
8375233 there are several un security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
8375234 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighboring country

8375325 the thing he needs to do is humanize himself so voters see him as a person instead of a mythical figure
8375326 it was hard to imagine that five years from then hed be running for president but it was also immediately apparent that he was a very unusual guy in intellect temperament and worldview

8375343 you know what you should do just shoot him i mean if he cant read your mind and know that you want to make out or giving hummers or whatever then you should just be able to shoot him dont have a mature conversation and discuss things just shoot him water cannon potato gun paint pellet gun tazer his ass you would like to think that in the 20 000 years or so of human existence that we men would have mastered the art of reading womens minds by now if not then its guantanamo for him maybe he will get his head out of his ass and be able to give you what you want without you being an adult and asking for it every man out there worth a 100 grand bar should be able to size up and provide for anything that a woman wants at any time i mean if we arent tending to your every need then we should be rounded up and shot out of the next space shuttle headed for mars venus or siberia maybe in the next few years scientists will come up with a perfect male that puts all of your needs and wants in life in front of his own i mean we men should be happy you tolerate us at all make him bow before you and kiss your feet he doesnt realize how lucky he is to have you mortimer from down the street kisses your ass like its made out of dark chocolate and hes a total toad loser but at least he gets it that women are the be all end all of life im with ya girl we men dont appreciate what a treasure you are i dont even date anymore because i realize that you women are superior creatures whenever i see a woman i just whip my wallet at your feet credit cards facing you bow to your preternatural presence and get the hell out of the way because a goddess is in my presence

8375363 this translated into a 2 1 blog page view advantage across u s visitors over the last two weeks and ate into obamas overall audience lead in blogs
8375364 for the first time mccains estimated monthly blog traffic increased more than obamas by more than 200 000 page views obamas audience lead in the blogosphere has shrunk by nearly 10
8375365 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8375366 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8375367 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8375368 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8375369 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8375370 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8375371 this is embarrassing to watch this is so wrong im so glad thats not me this is f ing hilarious

8375382 travelers earlier this summer saw gas prices hit new record highs almost daily and it forced many of them to change their vacation plans
8375383 bill clinton and barack obama in so many ways two sides of the same coin
8375384 old heat and new cool two guys who came out of nowhere bereft of early connections overcoming the odds
8375385 obama does not like clinton and clinton knows it asserted one longtime clinton adviser a refrain that several compatriots repeated almost word for word though occasionally in stronger terms
8375386 just tuning in to see how aspergersgirl and scrivener are taking the news i see ags lost whatever little mind she had
8375387 black people always play the race card when things arent going their way and bill clinton thankfully wasnt going to bow at that extortion
8375388 lets assume that people dont vote for obama b c hes black there are many people voting him because he is black
8375389 who stood in the back of the room in a hillary t shirt and hat signed by hillary and nobama button and booed every time any of the women speakers mentioned obama s name
8375390 is this really the road i honestly think we should take
8375391 you start out as a racist and you cant try to go back on that
8375392 i will never ever vote for a black man for president who has despite having an ivy league law degree no meaningful body of professional works except for 2 hyperbolic
8375393 i will never ever vote for a black man for president
8375394 most people support obama because they like the idea of a black man as president but when they get to know obama they realize that this guy is incompetent inexperienced and a communist and gets scared this election will be a landslide victory for mccain
8375395 has got to be true because even enemies agree on it
8375396 again what are we showing our young people what are we saying to them about handling disappointment about winning and losing about human kindness and respect perhaps simple values like kindness and respect dont matter only winning at any cost
8375397 this town aint big enough fer the both of us
8375398 of course every infant has a right to lifesaving medical attention even if its not wanted
8375399 do not attempt to kill the baby in the uterus the goal is simply to prematurely deliver a baby who dies during the birth process or soon afterward
8375400 it is not uncommon for a live aborted baby to linger for an hour or two or even longer at christ hospital one lived for almost an entire eight hour shift
8375401 baptismal supplies gowns and certificates footprinting equipment and baby bracelets for mementos and a rocking chair
8375402 babies were taken to the soiled utility room to die
8375403 every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
8375404 breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
8375405 affirm deny or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive
8375406 but dont assume that the few racist voting against him equates to everyone voting against him b c of race b c that would just be silly
8375407 our news media doesnt educate with facts their comments belie their partisanship to say the least
8375408 we all know that if boy barack were white we would never have heard of him
8375409 some of us have seen right through the fake exterior from day one
8375410 no one i know in west virginia will vote for a black man
8375411 why do people assume that people dont listen i am listening ive been listening to him since he ran for sentator in illinois
8375412 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8375413 but now everyone knows hope and change and hope and change
8375414 no one i know in west virginia will vote for a black man
8375415 ah such a forum of the under informed biased and prejudices aspects of our society
8375416 i have a challenge for all those clinton supporters that say theyll vote for mccain or will not vote at all go to mccain rallies literally cheer him on applaud when his fellow republicans applaud really listen to his message and embrace it consider yourself part of his team
8375417 at least bill clinton balanced the budget and worked with republicans you wont see that with obama
8375418 we live in the greatest country in the world help me change it
8375419 sorry for that but you know politics better than anyone how about the four of us play a round of golf and have dinner and drinks
8375420 look im in this to win and i need 90 of the black vote and im never going to put up your numbers hillary with the latino community
8375421 and obama and clinton are not that much alike for example obamas treated hillary with a lot of respect
8375422 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
8375423 there are so many reasons to hate other people why choose skin color
8375424 black people always play the race card when things arent going their way
8375425 ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and a way that bill clinton did not
8375426 obama is a socialist with ties to radical leftists and terrorists he is admired in the middle east but disliked in new york city
8375427 unfortunately the platforms of the democratic party are being missed due to the media fixation on the
8375428 what will hillary say will she unite the party will bill stay on script
8375429 we were very proud to have come in second place

8375435 i would have liked hillary to be the candidate obviously and i think shes done a lot for women just as far as shes gotten but im obama all the way
8375436 she worked too hard not to be recognized and not to have her name placed on the nomination
8375437 its important that we are able to cast our votes for her and then turn around and cast our votes for barack obama
8375438 it not only highlighted the struggles she had in her career she talked about the womens movement which was critical and she also talked about uniting with barack and moving forward
8375439 and thats exactly what these delegates need to hear coming out of this convention
8375440 we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8375441 current news of gvax vital 2 phase 3 trial termination makes future development of the gvax prostate uncertain and adds additional developmental risk
8375442 we believe that there may be limited new news from the pipeline to provide catalysts for increased stock valuation until final data of vital 1 expected in the second half of 2009
8375443 it is possible to be disappointed and think that it was time for a woman to be president and still work hard for obama

8375463 i want to thank defenders of wildlife action fund supporters for their help in this hard fought campaign
8375464 we faced an approximately 750 000 campaign from our opponents including safari club international and a 400 000 state funded campaign approved by governor sarah palin and the alaska legislature
8375465 but thanks to the generous support of defenders of wildlife action fund activists and donors we were able to reach thousands of voters yesterday over 75 000 alaskans voted to end this barbaric practice
8375466 despite this loss were not giving up alaskans for wildlife will continue to hold the state board of games feet to the fire and redouble our efforts to end this brutal program

8375658 the detailed provision by the act for the consequences of non compliance with an industry code such as the franchising code of conduct does not support a conclusion that it was intended that the harsh consequences provided by the common law were to follow upon contravention of s 51ad the act provides a more flexible approach it allows a court to prevent entry into a franchise agreement to vary the terms of an agreement entered into in breach of the code or to terminate such an agreement or provide compensation for loss and damage if it is shown to have been caused by the contravention to render void every franchise agreement entered into where a franchisor had not complied with the code would be to give the franchisor the wrong doer an opportunity to avoid its obligations and at the same time to place the franchisee in breach of obligations to third parties a preferable result and one for which the act provides is to permit a franchisee to seek such relief as is appropriate to the circumstances of the case some cases of non compliance with cl 11 might involve substantial non disclosure others may only involve a failure to obtain the written statement confirming that the franchisee has read and understood the disclosure document and the code this is such a case section 51ad does not in its terms prohibit the making of a franchise agreement where a franchisor has not complied with the code that section and the code are concerned with the regulation of the conduct of participants in the franchising industry in particular the conduct of franchisors it is not to be inferred from a purpose which promotes or prescribes better and fairer business practices that contractual relations between parties will be affected

8375717 david tennant is already gaining a huge following and this will make him really hot property
8375718 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
8375719 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
8375720 er i 2 godt klar over at i st r og snakker i munden p hinanden
8375721 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8375722 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8375723 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8375724 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8375725 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8375726 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8375727 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8375728 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8375729 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8375730 aunque no se ha probado en humanos sabemos que los umbrales de detecci n de gusto son los mismos en personas y roedores

8375733 the addition of cifa will enable zoomlion to expand its market leadership in concrete machinery to the mature european markets and to capture fast emerging markets such as russia and india
8375734 led the fight in the senate for divestment legislation that would deliver powerful economic sanctions against iran
8375735 nos han aportado datos y esperanzas aunque el proceso se va a dilatar
8375736 basically every major veterans group is opposed to it so far so i think that pretty much says it all weve got to come up with a comprehensive solution to va health care and that starts with va funding sen mccain has consistently voted against expansion of va funding so if he says the vas not working its in part because he hasnt funded it properly
8375737 i dont believe obama is that much different than mccain

8375741 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity most days of the week is probably insufficient to spur any real change in a persons body weight
8375742 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity most days of the week
8375743 more than half of the study participants managed to lose at least 10 of their body weight within the first six months
8375744 more likely to be able to kill you in hand to hand combat
8375745 a study published july 28 in the archives of internal medicine adds to the burgeoning scientific consensus when it comes to exercise for weight loss more is better
8375746 ill bet they regret that youre so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece whats your name fatbody
8375747 yes doctor litte debbie snack cake ive been exercising 14 smores 68 minutes tub of kfc chicken per day
8375748 hmm morning tea i might just have one of these chocolate muffins how many calories could that possible be 100 200
8375749 once a patient hits her target weight he says its imperative that she stick with her exercise and diet regimen to maintain her new weight
8375750 achieving thinness they say is not simply a matter of willpower
8375751 the further you push you weight beyond your set point either up or down the scale some researchers say the more your body struggles to return to it
8375752 participants were also asked to restrict their food intake to between 1 200 and 1 500 calories per day
8375753 overall the more the women exercised the more weight they lost
8375754 so if youre aiming to lose weight and keep it off his message is clear dont slack off
8375755 the problem was that not enough of the women stuck with their assigned exercise categories for the researchers to gather enough meaningful data
8375756 within a few months most of the participants had resorted to exercising as much as they chose to
8375757 the secret to success is to avoid food that tastes great

8375768 this has been a very important and a very encouraging meeting said de boer
8375769 the process has speeded up and governments are becoming very serious about negotiating a result
8375770 accra shows that overcoming the muddle of conflicting views and crafting an effective deal to tackle climate change is possible
8375771 we are running out of time on this problem from the scientific point of view
8375772 a potential trigger of rapid and abrupt and extreme climate change
8375773 the poor want to lead a dignified life a life that is secure
8375774 they need to develop and the opportunity unfortunately is linked to having energy

8375781 the great danger for family life in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure comfort and independence lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish
8375782 mit 816 einstellungen haben wir die rahmenbedingungen f r alle schulen verbessert
8375783 ich gehe davon aus dass alle schulen 100 prozent der n tigen personellen ausstattung haben
8375784 gerade die schulen in problembezirken oder mit einem hohen migranten anteil klagen ber massive einschnitte vor allem beim personal
8375785 einige schulen mussten schon jetzt auf die lehrerfeuerwehr zur ckgreifen um einigerma en gut starten zu k nnen
8375786 wir konnten lediglich nicht alle f cher so besetzen wie wir wollten
8375787 wenn nicht gen gend fachkr fte f r die so wichtigen f cher mathematik physik und sprachkombinationen gefunden wurden dann m ssen einstellungen k nftig eben auch von au en erfolgen

8375821 security forces killed 25 30 militants including some important commanders and foreigners in bajaurs raghan region
8375822 around 75 100 militants attacked a checkpost on the night of august 26 27 security forces effectively repulsed the attack reportedly 11 militants were killed and 15 20 others injured
8375823 he was dressed as a woman he killed my brother and his bodyguards
8375824 speaking to key leadership personalities and assessing them is critical to what happens inside adhamiyah
8375825 it is a lot of people management we spend a lot of the day walking on the street to get a picture from the locals we sit down with the key leaders and from there it is a question of co ordinating them
8375826 i think that the government will come after us and there will be chaos
8375827 they dont come to hurt us and we dont go to their place
8375828 all of them are from the shia militia the mehdi army
8375829 they are dangerous we dont go there and they dont come to us
8375830 back there there was a wall that they had painted
8375831 over here on the left and right of the road you can see that it is pretty torn up what they are trying to do is lay cables to try to get the infrastructure back
8375832 for the last three days we have not electricity in this area
8375833 the people who are in charge of the area are thieves
8375834 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8375835 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
8375836 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
8375837 what do you think you are the second coming yea like you could think about a first coming if you know what im talking about
8375838 jimmy is just a towel boy to the senator and the whole thing has been a huge well whoops
8375839 if theres anything i cant stand its a typical white woman picking on some poor engineer from the great state of washington our 57th state come with me the bus with your name on it is outside
8375840 hillary my most high and glorious leader the best looking woman ever how may i serve you today
8375841 you are such feeble humans with tiny penises and you bore me
8375842 but his shirt was caught on the bbq handle and he was yelling get it off me meaning the fire apparently
8375843 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8375844 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence
8375845 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen
8375846 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8375847 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8375848 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8375849 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8375850 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8375851 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8375852 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8375853 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8375854 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8375855 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8375856 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8375857 celebrations in the white sox locker room high fives in the press box
8375858 im sure there are other cases of hidden people in the rural areas
8375859 well have to come out here and clean this up
8375860 we have so much to do around the county but well have to get this done
8375861 if we get a break in our aquifer that would be terrible
8375862 at some point i think people would like to see an end to quarry operations
8375863 were not so unhappy with the way things are now but we dont want them to expand hours of operation and we dont want noise or dust levels to increase
8375864 congressman buck mckeons legislation house resolution 5887 would eliminate the added congestion the mine would have caused with diesel belching 18 wheelers on the already overcrowded highway 14 and interstate 5 freeways
8375865 costs are up most for products currently being used for nonresidential building and highway projects
8375866 higher energy prices are pushing up production prices for many of these products
8375867 any quotes they give us have no more than a 30 day window
8375868 its a very difficult time we are in with steel and concrete and all the metals
8375869 we are in a world market now where the u s prices are being much more influenced by the global economies than we ever have in the past
8375870 then you have places like dubai in the middle east where the construction is going up
8375871 commodity futures prices for things like copper keep prices high not to mention petroleum prices for asphalt shingles and other petroleum based items
8375872 even labor costs may not be seeing that much contraction
8375873 contrary to popular belief construction employment is actually up not down despite the dramatic falloff in residential construction
8375874 fortunately rents have been picking up on just about all product types
8375875 as long as we have sound market fundamentals we are going to be all right
8375876 the increase in construction costs should translate in the long run to an increase in rental rates
8375877 thirty year laminated shingles went up in price from 35 to 65 a square
8375878 youd think with demand going down price would follow it but it doesnt seem to be doing that
8375879 we are convinced that the big environment of sichuans economy will quickly recover and we will be resolutely working hand with the sichuan people and all chinese people to build an even more beautiful future for sichuan
8375880 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8375881 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8375882 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8375883 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8375884 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8375885 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8375886 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8375887 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8375888 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8375889 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8375890 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8375891 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8375892 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8375893 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8375894 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8375895 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8375896 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8375897 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8375898 dont panic we have nothing to fear from an aging society
8375899 there would be only two persons of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
8375900 one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalization
8375901 the consequences of the aging population poses a greater threat to the national economy than climate change
8375902 its not as sexy a subject as climate change so this subject gets shoved off into the corner but its economic consequences are enormous and were calling on the government and the opposition to give the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt
8375903 i am so tired of the laziness of reporters who constantly trot out the common wisdom
8375904 like it or not the chinese solution to population control is no longer to be dismissed by the rest of the world
8375905 in a strange coincidence to earths last eden good vs evil emerges as a major theme this season
8375906 i think the audience will quickly identify with one group or the other
8375907 when you go to exile this time you can either get a clue that will help you find the hidden immunity idol or you can get instant comfort a nice thing to sleep on some food some fruit
8375908 depending upon the time well make the temptation bigger and bigger the idea was to see if anybody would be dumb enough to choose comfort over the only thing that guarantees you to stick in the game which is immunity
8375909 by the time this season is over you can make the case that maybe this is the dumbest team when it comes to idol play
8375910 if youre a survivor fan and you have hd it will be a completely different show
8375911 when you incorporate the wildlife its kind of like being in a spielberg movie i mean its so real looking that its exciting and scary
8375912 marcus the doctor from georgia one of the most arrogant guys that weve had on the show he at one point had three people after him probst told
8375913 bob crowley a 57 year old physics teacher from south portland me
8375914 i never needed his help to make plates out of these greenskins heads

8375916 wir haben daraus gelernt dass es zu einer partnerschaftlichen beziehung zwischen unseren l ndern keine alternative gibt
8375917 i never needed his help to make plates out of these greenskins heads
8375918 a legal issues primer for open source and free software projects
8375919 we can categorically state that we have not released man eating badgers into the area
8375920 cuando algunos medios de comunicaci n han puesto en peligro a la familia me veo en la necesidad de aclarar que la cantidad solicitada fue de 3 millones de pesos
8375921 quiero que sepan las personas que se la llevaron que la tienen que si a ellos no les salieron las cosas y silvita ya estuviera con dios entonces que me digan d nde la dejaron para nosotros ir por ella y ya estar en paz no sobreviviendo
8375922 pero si mi hija estuviera con vida pues entonces que me la devuelvan yo creo que ellos tienen a quien querer y alguien que los quiera que recuerden que son hijos de dios a n est n a tiempo g nense el cielo devu lvanme a silvita
8375923 en estos momentos cuando algunos medios de comunicaci n han puesto en peligro a la familia pues publicaron que se ofrec an 2 millones de d lares por silvia me veo en la necesidad de aclarar que la cantidad solicitada por las personas que se la llevaron fue de 3 millones de pesos no de d lares
8375924 estas cantidades inexactas y estas cosas no oficiales no salieron de nuestra boca no distorsionen la informaci n porque todo esto se empantana y pone en riesgo no solamente la vida de silvia sino tambi n de toda la familia
8375925 es impreciso que actualmente se ofrezca una recompensa por la cantidad de 2 millones de pesos como han difundido algunos medios
8375926 hasta ahorita no s por qu lo hicimos pero ah vamos en el barco todos navegando en contra de la tormenta y la corriente
8375927 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8375928 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of training camp
8375929 as we continue to hear more bad economic news we will continue to see bankruptcies spiral upwards
8375930 ryans said hes never stopped loving her not for a second
8375931 he tried to date but he was miserable rachels the one hes meant to be with
8375932 i saw them walking hand in hand along bathurst street
8375933 as they went by somebody yelled out were so happy to see you back together
8375934 god i am so sick of english speakers who think that they are representative
8375935 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8375936 o magno texto federal os protege basta que ele saia do papel e seja incorporado ao cotidiano a nossa constitui o que os ndios brasileiros devem reverenciar como sua carta de alforria e n o essa ou aquela declara o internacional de direito

8375940 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8375941 i thought no way was she going to be that aggressive
8375942 i work night shift so my days start at 1 a m
8375943 thats when i get up every morning i never go to bed before 10 p m because im raising my two siblings
8375944 right now you just cant pay the fees to get through the process of naturalization for her
8375945 in the meantime she is a legal resident but because she is a legal resident she doesnt qualify for government benefits so basically any help she needs in terms of her medical care if she was going to get it would have to be paid for out of pocket
8375946 im worry about you because i dont know if you should be drinking that red bull all of the time
8375947 obviously in terms of school helping you pay for your college education is very important
8375948 yet people like me and my younger sister barbara are going through real hard times barbara has cerebral palsy and she is developmentally disabled and in a wheelchair i took her under my wing because our mother has heart problems and is physically unable to take care of my sisters needs
8375949 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8375950 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8375951 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8375952 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8375953 hay cuatro comunas que adoptaron la decisi n de suspender las clases por la tarde b sicamente porque las condiciones de anegamiento de las calles hac an dif cil el acceso de los alumnos y sus apoderados a los establecimientos educacionales
8375954 nosotros solamente tenemos de manera oficial para el d a 10 de diciembre no hemos tenido ninguna solicitud distinta ni tampoco del lado informal digamos
8375955 si existiera el pedido bueno tendremos que hacer los mismos esfuerzos que hemos hecho y tendremos que buscar c mo armonizamos todo este proceso
8375956 vamos a tener que trabajar por eso si es que se diera una eventualidad
8375957 how effective thought through simple web design helps your business
8375958 i just saw some god awful black and white photography from now on no more black and white photography it sucks
8375959 dell is focused on early adopters and large customers about 50 worldwide to provide optimized servers storage and data center infrastructure
8375960 cloud computing is still an emerging market with standards across the framework and software stack still emerging we are trying to promote an ecosystem to build the software stack on top of the infrastructure you will gradually and judiciously see us add capabilities up and down the stack
8375961 dell is doing the most aggressive things possible to optimize for cloud computing

8376038 barring yet another unforeseen development the diablo grande golf resort and housing development should be sold at a bankruptcy hearing thursday the sale which is scheduled to be approved at 10 a m at the u s bankruptcy court in sacramento was initially supposed to take place at a hearing aug 19
8376039 but sale negotiations were still ongoing between diablo grande and at least two potential buyers so diablo grande attorney michael ahrens requested that the hearing be postponed until thursday
8376040 ahrens said at the aug 19 hearing that diablo grande which has taken out more than 2 million in loans to continue operating during the sale process only has enough money on hand to make it through this week
8376041 that could be bad news for residents who rely on the water diablo grande has been providing by way of those loans if a sale is not approved by the bankruptcy judge on thursday diablo grande might have no choice but to liquidate in chapter 7 bankruptcy
8376042 diablo grande has been for sale since at least november when encino based marcus amp millichap listed the project for 150 million it later dropped that price to 85 million but no sale was completed the developer filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy march 10
8376043 three years ago not a single existing home that closed escrow in manteca sold for under 320 000 in august this august it is a drastically different story of the last 70 homes to close escrow in manteca all but four ended up changing hands for less than 320 000
8376044 that 320 000 home three years ago had 896 square feet two bedrooms one bathroom no garage and a lot barely bigger than the house the highest priced house closing escrow so far this month for under 320 000 in manteca 312 000 was for 3 166 square feet with five bedrooms and three bathrooms
8376045 aggressively priced homes started hitting the market in july as many banks undercut previous price points as they went to list new foreclosures the aggressive change in bank pricing and the growing tidal wave of accepted offers has dropped the average sales price for the year down 8 252 since july 21 reflecting the much lower selling prices
8376046 that reflects a drop in the average value of 235 80 a day for the past 35 days and that average is destined to drop even farther there is a record 290 pending deals in manteca with an average price of 223 330 but the real story is the pending foreclosure sales that account for 212 homes and an average selling price of 200 006
8376047 agent jim muthart said the magic number that is assures a home will move quickly unless it has major structural issue or some other unusual circumstance is 170 000 that is a price at which an investor can buy the home with 20 percent down drop some money into it and still come away the first month renting it with a 100 positive cash flow
8376048 others argue that magic number is 220 000 to 230 000 but as muthurt pointed out homes bought in the 170 000 and under price range are the largest segment of the market seeking rentals which is 1 200 or less a month
8376049 as to when the market will bottom out muthart is fairly confident it is at the bottom or near it at least when it comes to the lower end of the market
8376050 its a bottom he described as a bouncing up and down along the bottom where one home lands with a lower price while a similar home gets a bounce up from the bottom due to spirited bidding wars

8376055 the property was listed by crisp amp cole real estate crisps former company when stewart bought it listing records indicate stewart was the listing agent

8376222 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8376223 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8376224 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8376225 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8376226 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes

8376229 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8376230 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8376231 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8376232 lets you create a list of up to 50 stocks called a basket that you can save trade manage and track as one entity
8376233 how do those beijing streets get so clean well spend some time with a 83 year old street cleaner after we return from these messages
8376234 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8376235 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8376236 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8376237 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8376238 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8376239 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8376240 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8376241 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8376242 im pleased the shuttle routes were restored in time for the first football game
8376243 hotard coaches will provide good service to our fans and i am especially appreciative of the downtown business association for stepping forward and making the downtown routes possible
8376244 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8376245 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8376246 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8376247 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8376248 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8376249 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8376250 a photolog of new york with an emphasis on urban decay strange signage and general weirdness
8376251 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8376252 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8376253 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8376254 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8376255 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8376256 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8376257 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8376258 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8376259 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8376260 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8376261 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8376262 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8376263 who are open to doing something on the production side
8376264 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8376265 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8376266 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8376267 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8376268 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8376269 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8376270 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8376271 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8376272 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8376283 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
8376284 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
8376285 we are still on track the process has speeded up
8376286 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with deforestation
8376287 we may have something in poznan pretty close to a negotiating text
8376288 the talks here have made it clear that sectoral approaches are not about imposing targets sectoral approaches are something that a government may or may not choose to do on a national level

8376292 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8376293 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8376294 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8376295 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8376296 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8376297 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8376298 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8376299 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8376300 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8376301 opens the door to moving the case forward so the county can force the industry to reveal its charging practices which are governed by a contract with the federal government
8376302 disagree with the courts decision and willl consider the next step including the possibility of further appeals
8376303 confident it will prevail if the case goes forward because it did not overcharge and
8376304 im very optimistic we managed to get by with only losing two birds and we have had a great response from our donors we are very focused said kelly sorenson executive director of the ventana wildlife society a non profit group that has released condors in big sur since 1997
8376305 condor sanctuary a remote outpost where condors were regularly treated for medical problems fitted with radio transmitters and released
8376306 theyre all doing great they all are still in good health george said
8376307 i dont think there will be any long term impact he added it was a stressful couple of days for them but they settled into our site pretty well and started to exhibit normal behavior pretty soon
8376308 we think the fire or the smoke overtook them the bodies were never recovered but its been long enough now that we presume they are dead
8376309 its encouraging to me how well the birds survived during the fire sorenson said
8376310 not only can they deal with fire when it is occurring but it gives us some foreshadowing that the condors can survive on their own when we are ready
8376311 i am disappointed with the federal governments decision not to provide individual assistance particularly given the number families whose homes suffered considerable damage
8376312 even though federal assistance for individuals has been denied the state will continue to work with local communities and various volunteer organizations to provide assistance to families
8376313 quer tenham votado em mim ou em obama chegou a hora de nos unirmos como um nico partido com uma nica proposta

8376329 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable 8 point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8376330 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8376331 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems
8376332 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8376333 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8376334 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8376335 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8376336 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8376337 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8376338 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8376339 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8376340 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8376341 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8376342 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8376343 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8376344 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8376345 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8376346 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8376347 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8376348 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8376349 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8376350 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8376351 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8376352 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8376353 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8376354 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8376355 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8376356 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8376357 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8376358 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8376359 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8376360 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8376361 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8376362 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8376363 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8376364 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8376365 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8376366 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8376367 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8376368 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8376369 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8376370 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8376371 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8376372 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8376373 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8376374 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8376375 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8376376 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8376377 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8376378 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8376379 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8376380 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8376381 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8376382 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8376383 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8376384 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8376385 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8376386 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8376387 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8376388 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8376389 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8376390 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8376391 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8376392 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8376393 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8376394 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8376395 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8376396 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8376397 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8376398 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8376399 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

8376406 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8376407 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8376408 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8376409 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8376410 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8376411 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8376412 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

8376419 en varias partes de la conversaci n se notaba que ella me buscaba esas no salieron

8376424 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8376425 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8376426 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8376427 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8376428 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8376429 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8376430 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8376431 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8376432 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8376433 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8376434 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8376435 efficient highly available storage is a vital component in every virtualization scenario and is often underestimated
8376436 with citrix xenserver virtualization stoneflys customers can increase server and storage utilization while reducing expenditures on equipment power cooling and datacenter space stonefly is a great addition to our growing list of ecosystem partners

8376440 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8376441 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8376442 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8376443 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8376444 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8376445 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8376446 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8376447 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8376448 no one works for someone we all just work together
8376449 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8376450 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8376451 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8376452 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8376453 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8376454 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8376455 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8376456 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8376457 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8376458 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8376459 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8376460 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8376461 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8376462 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8376463 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8376464 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8376465 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8376466 our waiting areas are so shitty youll be more comfortable on the plane
8376467 you had my tender baby knees crawling on that unyielding hardwood floor crap when there was this this plushness to be had lady if i could dial thered be a serious call to dss
8376468 grandma tell me again about the time you picked mommy up from jail
8376469 it has been a wonderful experience just talking to the photographers about their work
8376470 there are so many stories behind each photograph it really makes them come alive there was a great deal of creative effort involved in some of the work both in the past and currently which makes you appreciate the work these photojournalists have done and do now
8376471 i knew it wasn t going to be easy it was something i had to do i am in love with the city and what relationship is good if you dont work for it
8376472 but i could see central park and the lights on the chrysler building and i wasn t looking at it as a tourist i was looking at it as though i was home
8376473 the subway doesn t work in the morning and youre a half hour late for work and thats not in your control you have to find ways of surviving
8376474 i just realized that i didn t need to find it that my place in the city would fall into place
8376475 now i dont make an effort i roll with things its not just the city its yourself that you have to deal with as well
8376476 every day you encounter situations where you have to step out of your safety zone and its really kind of a self discovery experience
8376477 i see myself fighting it but i also i see myself every day becoming a new yorker
8376478 wait a minute if i get a baby chick to keep as a pet eventually the baby chick will grow up and become a full grown chicken and i live in an apartment clearly this is a horrible idea

8376490 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8376491 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8376492 the weakness the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8376493 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8376494 i think what we see is a lot of confusion right now im not sure investors really know what to do youve got oil jumping all over the place
8376495 the fact that the plane was kidnapped from darfur indicates that one of the militant groups may have prepared for this operation and the fact that they want to go to france adds more to that theory

8376501 must not be empty talk if the united states moves on a road to intensify confrontation with the north it may lead to a situation where the hands of the denuclearization clock may run backward
8376502 there is no guarantee that the same situation in which the north was forced to conduct the nuclear test would not be created
8376503 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8376504 relations between nations living under one roof need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity
8376505 reconciled itself to the loss of 14 former soviet republics which became states in their own right
8376506 immediately stripped its autonomous regions of abkhazia and south ossetia of their autonomy
8376507 fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8376508 the continued russian presence in georgia outside of abkhazia and south ossetia for example in poti represents a significant violation of the six point plan agreement
8376509 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8376510 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8376511 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane

8376513 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica
8376514 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles
8376515 its like a roller coaster ride shes a person who is highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8376516 at 15 she had a huge breakdown and had to return home to louisiana
8376517 she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8376518 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person
8376519 shes on a temporary high right now but shes never really dealt with all the problems she had i dont think its possible to turn over a new leaf just like that
8376520 in fact shes nicer than most of the stars ive met but as britney once told me herself her life has always been two steps forward followed by one step back
8376521 the goal of this handbook is to provide a source of rapid information to help in the safe use and disposal of chemicals

8376572 so i said all that to say this when you start with an incorrect biblical premise and then build on that foundation what you will end up with is something totally unbiblical in order for the leaders to maintain this they must resort to control of the members any time a member sees something wrong they must do damage control immediately so that the truth does not spread to others ie telling sadparents son not to speak to his mother for a year why does this happen i will give you the simple answer follow the money trail do some research check out that mike bickle is the ceo of ihop and that his wife is the ceo of her realty company and mike is the vp charisma did an article on her and her company a few years ago its online and you can look it up she finds property ihop buys it she gets paid a commission then at the end of the year she gives all her profits back to ihop their tax exempt organization and then they do it all over again nice deal so who really owns all the property mike and diane now come along all the interns who have to pay almost 5k for 6 months to live there and pray there ok you do the math 100 interns at 4 900 each that comes to almost 1 2 a million dollars a year do that twice and you have a million how long have you been there and how much have you paid to be members there please show me in the bible where you have to pay to pray well i could go on but time restrains me i pray that your mind is opened to hear the truth if you are willing just ask the lord to show you the truth and he will and just for your information here is some good info on identifying cults how to identify cults from ehow as diverse as cults may be in their teachings and individual creeds there are undeviating similarities that identify them as cults there are certain tactics involved in gaining and retaining membership which become so deeply ingrained in the cult members psychological and emotional make up that it is very difficult to leave the cult and reform their lives step 1 watch for changes in the individuals personality and a growing estrangement from or even hostility towards family and friends cult members are discouraged from remaining in contact with former associates who might cause them to doubt the teachings and practices of the cult members are indoctrinated to distrust anyone who criticizes the cult or leader s step2 be aware cult members are often convinced to contribute all of their money and goods to the cult as a sign of their commitment there is a strong emphasis on collecting money which is often made by selling goods to the public and then donating it to the cult as part of their ministry they spend much time recruiting other members which they do by preying on their emotions step3 recognize the lack of control over the members private life cult leaders monopolize the members time and relationships cultivating complete dependence on themselves and the cult members are taught to distrust anyone outside the cult and are discouraged from reading any material except what is provided or approved by the cult marriages and living arrangements usually communal living are dictated by cult leaders step4 note that cult members are discouraged from thinking for themselves they are given little or no time alone and are constantly engaged in physical or group activities they are engaged in mind altering behaviors such as chanting denunciation of selves and others and encouraged to report suspicious behaviors of other cult members including their own families shame and fear of alienation cements their dependence on the cult step5 notice the unquestioning dedication which cult followers exhibit towards their leader they learn to rationalize his behaviors even if these contradict previously held beliefs or common sense they believe happiness and redemption comes solely from their leader s and they will sacrifice nearly everything for the benefit of the cult step6 keep in mind that forcing or coercing a member to leave a cult can cause psychological and emotional damage they have been programmed to believe god will punish them if they leave and threats are used to force them to maintain silence about cult activities it is necessary to get help from a professional deprogrammer and assure that they are kept away from other active cult members

8376580 there are other frozen conflicts things could get very awkward
8376581 it would pose a far greater risk to european peace than the georgian conflict
8376582 any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8376583 it is necessary then to cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you and to give thanks continuously and because all things have contributed to your advancement you should include all things in your gratitude
8376584 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos into order confusion into clarity it turns problems into gifts failures into success the unexpected into perfect timing and mistakes into important events gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
8376585 i would be cautious to provide a positive recommendation if this were to be proposed in germantown
8376586 i would like to evaluate mequons experiences with this new ordinance for awhile
8376587 having said that i know there are municipalities who have adopted these types of ordinances and the law has changed last year to accommodate that
8376588 knowing chief graff from mequon pd i am sure his research was thorough and well thought out

8376593 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8376594 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8376595 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8376596 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8376597 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8376598 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8376599 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8376600 but we have reached out to others who are not korean and other international players and impressed upon them the need to speak english and the requirements of this policy players have been very supportive of it
8376601 when we dont have enough kids how are we going to play someone that is three times bigger than us
8376602 i was going to go to lbj for the 2007 08 school year but i decided to give johnston a try and it just didnt work out
8376603 i think they deserve that opportunity and if theyre happy im happy
8376604 i think the kids that want to be here are here
8376605 the ones that stayed i believe they think were going to change our goal is to begin something new at eastside and they want to be a part of that legacy
8376606 we are not just a group of players but a group of friends
8376607 we have only been together for a month but we are getting along very well whether they are australians or new zealanders
8376608 in the second half it really came together and it paid off
8376609 but we mustnt get too excited we must keep our feet on the ground stick to our game plan continue doing what tana is teaching us and it will all go okay
8376610 we showed our place in the top 14 is justified we are going to try to keep the same desire we had during that second half
8376611 we only played for one half thats all i can say things will have to be said
8376612 we had to deal with a revitalised toulon who put together some counter attacking moves and made the most of our errors to score their points
8376613 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
8376614 because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science
8376615 and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresposible on my part

8376627 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me

8376635 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8376636 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8376637 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8376638 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8376639 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8376640 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8376641 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8376642 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8376643 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8376644 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8376645 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8376646 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8376647 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8376648 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8376649 the beauty of this all of course is that it can be done for so cheap

8376657 if we win ill go down as having the lowest iq of any genius who ever lived
8376658 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning i can tell you that
8376659 it would have been very difficult to know what to do
8376660 im looking for the hottest players but they dont play for the united states
8376661 so i can look at the top 12 guys and maybe make a choice just based on that
8376662 better does not necessarily mean more entertaining if you want entertainment you watch twenty20 cricket we dont want rugby to be twenty20 cricket
8376663 that has to be the judgment line these changes have been made with a view to entertainment not to improving rugby
8376664 the pressure on rugby in australia is to win fans theyre competing directly against aussie rules rugby league and football
8376665 all three are simple motion games where the ball is always in play to compete the super 14 has become a quick tap motion game
8376666 the ball is in play a lot but that doesnt create a better game it creates entertainment to the detriment of rugby
8376667 now theres test match cricket and twenty20 cricket but we need to keep test match rugby
8376668 around the world most people want to watch test rugby there are pockets around the world who want to see twenty20 cricket so lets make twenty12 rugby
8376669 we could have 12 players 20 minutes each way with no scrums or line outs
8376670 as the game becomes more professional another form of the game could develop sevens hasnt been a success as entertainment
8376671 it might do well in hong kong and wellington but around the world you might find another form of the game springs up eventually
8376672 just have a look at what the world cup has done in europe rugby in france is so big now they had four club games with 80 000 crowds last season

8376771 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8376772 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8376773 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8376774 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8376775 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8376776 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8376777 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8376790 our system does not currently allow online accounts to receive paper bills in the mail
8376791 yes i understand that is the way your system is set up but why cant i still receive my paper bill
8376792 this is what i have faced all my life the trivialization of me which i have not ever let bother me i have always been able to rise above the expectations

8376795 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
8376796 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
8376797 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8376798 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8376799 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8376800 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to
8376801 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8376802 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8376803 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8376804 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8376805 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8376806 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8376807 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8376808 when they tear down a ballpark like that obviously the history thats going on in new york you miss it
8376809 its one of the first major ballparks that i ever played in when i was coming up with the blue jays you step back you feel the history you know what has happened in yankee stadium yeah youll miss it
8376810 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years
8376811 its a pretty special cathedral in baseball and hopefully im around next year to see the new one
8376812 you ask me that about fenway park and itd be different were not a part of what goes on there
8376813 so you go to yankee stadium and you felt like the game was important you knew you were playing a game that people care about and thats a nice feeling
8376814 you know how these things go it all goes in cycles right now its a need cycle for the u s we need to find more great champions itll happen soon enough
8376815 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
8376816 were trying to stay a little bit underneath the radar whatever you want to call it about not trying to talk too big and hopefully let our play do whatever talking needs to be said
8376817 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
8376818 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
8376819 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do
8376820 hes a tremendous guy and competitor believe me we understand what we have
8376821 sheets has put together a good season but his history of injuries makes it tough to commit that kind of money to
8376822 therell be a controversial call and people will start saying we have the technology so why dont we use it for other things then pressure will mount on the higher ups and theyll succumb to the public pressure and start using it for everything
8376823 we cant worry about whether the games are home or away
8376824 were in the part of the season where we have to win series doesnt matter where we do it or how we do it
8376825 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
8376826 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
8376827 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
8376828 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
8376829 these figures show the shadow of repossession is no longer just cast over homeowners but also thousands of innocent renters who have no idea how close they are to eviction
8376830 sadly the impact of repossession can be even greater for tenants who despite paying rent on time can find themselves with very few rights and the first they even know about it is when the bailiffs start banging on the door
8376831 mortgage lenders must take responsibility and make sure they inform both owners and tenants when taking action to repossess so tenants are aware they are about to lose their home
8376832 the government must step in now to protect people who may find themselves homeless because their landlord is being repossessed by making sure courts treat tenants fairly and give them enough time to find a new home
8376833 the drivers include climate change oil depletion energy security deregulation new technologies like nanomaterial biotech and information technologies which allow you to manage distributed energy resources in a way we couldnt 15 years ago all these trends coming together at once create an enormously powerful transformation and opportunities to invest

8376861 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
8376862 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure

8376919 after sixty years what does amsterdam 1948 mean for us today

8376921 with polls finding the economy the number one issue across the land voters are starved for a convincing story about how each candidate would restore broadly shared prosperity
8376922 voters dont want a laundry list they do want some specifics that would make a real difference plus they want an overall vision that restores confidence in the possibility of a better future weve prepared a speech that outlines how america could create a moral economy that delivers economically and sustains rather than undermines families and communities we encourage both candidates to take freely from it
8376923 we think our scorecard criteria provide a solid basis on which the average voter can evaluate both candidates

8376929 with more than 1 000 exhibiting companies and buyers from around the globe attending the market the july 2008 show was a success
8376930 there is no substitute for the personal touch and one on one relationship building between buyers and sellers that takes place at a show everywhere i went on the show floor i heard optimism and more importantly saw a lot of sales being closed for the fall and the upcoming holiday selling season
8376931 the great thing about this show is the sophistication of the buyer and of course youre in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with great restaurants and great accessibility
8376932 so its a unique combination of work and what you can do personally after the show closes this is always a very good market for us and were looking forward to coming back in february

8376938 with a re designed show in february 2009 we are poised for a new era in the life of the sfigf and will create the wave that others will ride
8376939 the sfigf continues its pattern of being a show where buyers can find new and unique product that will help them differentiate themselves from their competitors what better way to do that than to take a cue from our host city with a focus on san franciscos classic neighborhoods
8376940 south of market soma named after san franciscos iconic cultural district will bring focus to museum resources and the increasingly popular handcrafted markets

8377044 he comes up to me and goes so yeah right the reason i said stuff about you was because i saw you on that programme doing me and i was just about to put my biscuit in my tea and i left it in for too long and it ruined my biscuit
8377045 i ruined his biscuit so he started slagging us off thats alright isnt it

8377060 viewers do remember the network and they remember the programming it really wasnt that long ago and yes marketers and ad agencies do recall the network as well but we mainly felt that the wb had a distinct identity and connection with a certain type of viewer and a certain style of programming so it made sense to bring it back
8377061 we have a pretty wide tent in terms of the kinds of advertisers we hope to partner with
8377062 we have a clear editorial point of view with regard to the kind of programming we run whereas hulu is more of a generalist secondly its not just about the videos with us the site is as much programming as it is about the games and video mashups that users can create we sought to create a more immersive experience

8377064 the management of the company appear not to be at all concerned about the delivery of quality journalism
8377065 there is a new wave appearing at fairfax media which is all about low cost low quality journalism and andrew jaspan is just the first of many people to experience the wrath of the company and to be dismissed

8377118 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8377119 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8377120 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8377121 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8377122 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8377123 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8377124 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8377125 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8377126 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8377127 i have to consult my staff on how many houses i own
8377128 between the two candidates i think senator obama is closer to the churchs teaching than senator mccain is
8377129 we need to talk about the lives lost in iraq war
8377130 when you compare the 4 000 soldiers who lost their lives fighting valiantly in iraq to the 4 000 babies who died today it becomes clear barack obama has admirable qualities but he advocates legal abortion for all nine months
8377131 affordable family planning for comprehensive sex education and for a womans right to choose
8377132 he will be a president who supports womens health and rights one hundred percent hes the change america needs
8377133 if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8377134 john mccain believes that judges politicians and bureaucrats know better than women themselves whats best for their health care
8377135 for mom for lily and for all women barack obama is the right choice
8377136 despite the black cloud hanging over the mortgage industry the california association of mortgage brokers camb annual convention held august 6th 9th in sacramento was a success
8377137 to have a forum like this that mortgage brokers can come together and collaborate and share survival strategies is vital i believe in and support what camb is doing for our industry that is why it was important to me that american pacific mortgage contribute as much as possible
8377138 i wouldnt have missed this event for anything the learnings that you take away from a camb convention are important even in a good market in a market like this they are crucial
8377139 never before in my 20 years in the business has our industry organization been so relevant it is very possible that without the lobbying done by camb and other industry organizations mortgage brokers would go extinct only by banding together can we keep our industry viable

8377144 this race was incredible the course was challenging but the tires hooked up great
8377145 this truck was dialed in for the course and we are proud to bring home this important win for general tire
8377146 when we announced this tire at sema last fall we knew that this was going to be the tire to beat this year and with this race weve proven that it is legendary when a new competition tire wins in its debut year
8377147 for one dont allow people to post a review of an app unless they buy it
8377148 of course apple should do some qc on the apps going in but other than making sure it meets technical and legal standards they should just let the economy sort it out
8377149 the app store is not some sacred grail meant to house all of our hopes and dreams for a peaceful loving world its just a mechanism to distribute software

8377204 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8377205 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
8377206 so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
8377207 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8377208 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8377209 for the most part generally hes more often than not not a complete idiot most of the time

8377247 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8377254 aside from that the cost of regulation to vector is at least 7 million a year
8377255 i think its also important to note the confidence of the bill going through has been driven off the fact of the select committee being unanimous

8377257 demand is very strong as a trust bank we are in a good position to respond to societys changes and demands

8377264 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8377265 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8377266 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8377267 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8377268 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis

8377282 why google is not showing our ads on google search or content results though we are running adwords ad campaign
8377283 in joe biden barack obama has found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president
8377284 we dont look at it that he talks too much
8377285 my private life has been lived in a public arena
8377286 an ultraconservative colleague of mine stopped himself in the middle of a tear about bidens liberalism and said but i have to admit he took care of his kids a reference to the senators coming home every night to parent his two young sons after the car accident
8377287 of course some folks criticize sen biden some more bitterly than others after more than 30 years in public life thats a given
8377288 no one i know doubts that his family values are deep and sincere
8377289 the idea seems to be that delaware is just too small to allow anyone to get away with very much for very long
8377290 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8377291 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s
8377292 trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes
8377293 were not dealing with some sort of garden variety regulatory dispute in which the consequences come later in the form of some sort of civil penalty
8377294 the consequences whenever they come i think are going to be considerably more severe for everyone involved in this
8377295 if you want to do this you have to make a commitment that youre going to be active certainly for the next two or three years
8377296 and so dont just think this is going to be some flash in the pan over nov
8377297 senator obama i think the case can be made very strongly from the words of democrats is just not ready to lead hillary clinton said that during the campaign directly
8377298 to see then someone with 50 percent of the vote in the democratic primaries not chosen and apparently not even vetted by mr obama to me was more than surprising it was shocking our party is united im not sure the democrats are united
8377299 you know mike huckabee and mitt romney were taking shots at john mccain
8377300 and i certainly wouldnt recommend that the obama campaign spend any money putting mitt romneys comments about john mccain on the air because i just dont think it works
8377301 is it effective to draw me over to the mccain camp
8377302 no i will not be voting for mccain but i will just say this the question of obamas experience is a legitimate question
8377303 we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank check to an undemocratic president
8377304 arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaida in afghanistan and pakistan
8377305 needed reform of these alliances and institutions will not come by bullying other countries to ratify american demands
8377306 we want to assure the parties that their efforts up until now wont have been in vain
8377307 practical and achievable is helping georgia to reconstruct itself and getting it to focus on that reconstruction rather than tweaking moscows nose
8377308 foreign policy issues traditionally dont get that much attention at a convention
8377309 shows this is a fight they want i see obamas pick of biden as not showing that obama is weak on these issues i think its a sign that democrats think theyre on the winning side of these issues its a display of confidence and thats a big change

8377337 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8377338 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8377339 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8377340 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8377341 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8377342 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8377343 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8377344 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years

8377383 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8377384 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8377385 they are the sort of people who say that they are 100 per cent committed to the environment at home
8377386 they will say they are good for 48 weeks of the year but for the other four they want to be let off
8377387 in considering the sanctions to impose i have been guided by the principle that the sanctions should address and be proportional to the specific findings of research misconduct
8377388 in my judgment as purdues chief academic officer it is inappropriate for a faculty member who has been found guilty of research misconduct to hold a title of a named university professor all rights and privileges associated with the distinction including the allocation of discretionary resources are hereby withdrawn
8377389 i concur in the assessment of the investigative committee that the effects of this matter on the students and postdoctoral fellows are especially deplorable mentors of young scientists need to exhibit the highest standard of ethical behavior and collegiality
8377390 for a minimum of three years from the date of this letter your status as a member of the purdue university graduate faculty will be limited to that of special graduate faculty you will be permitted to serve on graduate committees but will not be able to serve as a major professor or co major professor for graduate students during this time
8377391 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8377392 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8377393 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8377394 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8377395 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8377396 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8377397 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8377398 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8377399 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8377400 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8377401 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8377402 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8377403 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8377404 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you
8377405 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8377406 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8377407 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8377408 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8377409 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8377410 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8377411 if you look back 10 years ago the web was a very static place
8377412 fast forward and weve seen this amazing change in the web
8377413 as a band ratatat can get away with doing a whole spectrum of styles
8377414 we can do stuff that sounds almost classical and we can do stuff that sounds electro or even metal and we can get it all on one record because theres something that holds it together and i dont know if you can really do that if youre like a traditional rock band with a singer
8377415 i spent a lot of time in my bedroom multi tracking stuff playing guitar and bass and singing unfortunately
8377416 that was always part of the process i wasnt too confident about
8377417 we only had four songs wed never played a single show
8377418 it was like oh we should actually do something with this
8377419 if you give it a chance and you really pay attention turn it up really loud i think theres plenty there
8377420 everyone shits honestly and everyone has fucked up things they hide i show mine with a sense of humor
8377421 there just really hasnt been anything to stimulate me to have a more wild show i dont force things i think its really contrived to just prance around on stage just for attention thats not what my point was in the beginning my point was to create a specific atmosphere and i just havent really felt stimulated that way lately
8377422 i mean if i was there to see nine inch nails i wouldnt really be that concerned with the opening band i dont take it personally
8377423 its just from trent reznors generosity and hearing our music and liking it
8377424 its not like its any indication of how things are in general
8377425 i got to the point where i felt id done everything i could at the paper
8377426 al manzi asked us to only have young good looking people in photos so thats what we did
8377427 we put up photos of girls in bikinis and guys with their shirts off because thats what they wanted
8377428 the idea is that if were building a paper for a certain audience we want that audience reflected in the paper
8377429 and were putting together a paper for college students and twenty somethings
8377430 the daily wasnt serving the majority of its audience effectively we found that out when we did research
8377431 just three years ago only half of the high school seniors who walked the halls of this building were accepted to college
8377432 but today thanks to the hard work of caring parents innovative educators and some very committed students all 44 seniors of this years graduating class have been accepted to more than seventy colleges and universities across the country
8377433 but also to hold up this school and these students as an example of whats possible in education if were willing to break free from the tired thinking and political stalemate thats dominated washington for decades if were willing to try new ideas and reforms based not on ideology but on what works to give our children the best possible chance in life
8377434 if we live by the statistics that dominate this community right now we could cut this circle in half and send that half of you home going at the pace were going only half of you will graduate high school and of those a minuscule number will ever get into or go to college
8377435 were here because we believe thats not the way it ought to be
8377436 we just wanted to get together and see if we clicked at all and had any vibe to do anything
8377437 we were supposed to be getting together to meet one another and we wrote eight songs so i said that vibe must be pretty strong i went back to the hotel and i was drained but trying to write eight songs in one night can be a mamma jamma ya know
8377438 they was gonna play all this hip music and all this fancy stuff and the more they worked on that stuff and the more they tried to fit it to al the more it sounded like al green in 1973 and thats exactly what you got out there you got an al green cut that sounds like the 1973 stuff you ought to be with me look what you done for me all that stuff it sounds like that its just cut in 2008 so when they got done playing their hip stuff and everything the only thing that would fit was the stuff that al jackson and willie mitchell and them was playing from the beginning
8377439 lay it down let it go fall in love thats what its about
8377440 you know i bet i could remove one of their guns from a holster before they ever even realized i was behind them
8377441 despite the high corporate tax rates many foreign multinationals recognize the importance of the u s market from a global standpoint
8377442 they understand that the business and profit opportunities in the united states often outweigh the tax costs of doing business in the united states
8377443 there is a growing consensus across the ideological spectrum that the u s needs to cut its corporate rate to remain competitive in a global economy
8377444 the idea has been long championed by conservatives but many democrats have recently supported lowering rates
8377445 several other countries in recent years have reduced corporate tax rates in an attempt to attract such investment and for the most part such measures have been successful
8377446 u s based multinational groups often feel they are at a disadvantage compared to certain foreign based multinational groups because of high u s corporate tax rates a u s tax system that taxes u s corporations on their worldwide income and the application of certain anti deferral regimes such as the subpart f regime

8377453 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8377454 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8377455 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8377456 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8377457 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8377461 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8377462 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8377463 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8377464 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8377465 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8377466 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8377467 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi
8377468 i wonder if one s love for radio will juice up this player
8377469 naturally i wanted sharelle out there leading the team but knowing sharelles on court intensity it was not worth taking the risk and playing her at this stage
8377470 we are taking a conservative approach to ensure she gets her body right for next year and beyond
8377471 ultimately while she is disappointed to not be taking part in the international series this is about the long term welfare of sharelle mcmahon in the australia netball team
8377472 this is an important series but we are at the start of an exciting four year cycle that includes the commonwealth games and world championships
8377473 if rushing back now without being fully fit puts these longer term goals in jeopardy then it isnt worth the risk
8377474 the democrats chose denver for their convention in the hopes of poaching colorado from the gop
8377475 it appears that hasnt happened yet although thursday nights main event in denvers football stadium may help obama make some inroads
8377476 pennsylvania voters tend to be a bit older than in most states so its good news for obama that hes actually carrying senior citizens in the keystone state nationally seniors tend to pick mccain
8377477 but the bad news for obama is that hes only pulling a quarter of the rural voters in pennsylvania thats a far worse showing for obama than rural voters in nevada or colorado
8377478 the west is the best get here and well do the rest
8377479 obama takes double digit lead in one battleground state trails in another

8377482 we have had no discussions with jake white on the subject and in fact the principle of a director of rugby post will only be reviewed by the presidents council on friday
8377483 i dont want to be in the limelight and im also not looking for the pressures that go with it ive had my turn all that i would like to do is help thats what i have always wanted to do
8377484 de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing and that of the south african rugby union presidents council and of the board of sa rugby
8377485 freshmen are showing up in the class and flipping up their laptop and starting from the get go making them a tool within the classroom
8377486 were putting them in a position in which they go out into the real world thats whats going to happen
8377487 theyre going to be given a laptop computer and theyre going to have to learn how to use that technology
8377488 providing our students was not a gimmick its a valuable tool and i think thats reflected in the fact that our freshman class is the largest freshman class weve had in about 20 years
8377489 and there is no blood on my hands my hands are clean right now
8377490 what the hell were you smoking when you were up there
8377491 im not going to say anything but youre a very smart woman keesha says now they know that ollie and michelle have an alliance
8377492 you see killbots have a preset kill limit knowing their weakness i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shutdown kif show them the medal i won
8377493 that wasnt what i was expecting but it entertained me
8377494 you see killbots have a preset kill limit knowing their weakness i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shutdown kif show them the medal i won
8377495 research shows the network supports some of the last strongholds of australias most threatened native animals and plants on public land and it provides some of the last connections of nature in our extensively cleared and modified landscapes thus facilitating the movement of animals and plants across the landscape
8377496 a review has recommended to the nsw government that travelling stock routes should be ceded back to the department of lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention which means they have to be profitable
8377497 this means the department of lands can do whatever they see fit with their routes they can lease them or sell them or do whatever they like
8377498 the problem seems to be the inability by the applicants to provide lending institutions with some form of security over the leased land and it just seems to be put together hastily i think
8377499 they indicated that they were prepared to back this scheme and we proceeded on the basis of assurances from a broad range of financial institutions that they would support the scheme
8377500 im sorry sweetie we tried that and you wiggled around too much
8377501 i didnt hear a plane i dont think there was one its ok you need to sleep mommy and daddy need to sleep we all need sleep and we are all tired
8377502 no i dont sweetie you need to sleep mommy needs to sleep its ok we have a roof over our heads and we are safe
8377503 its really fun im impressed with the people and theyre impressed with how nice everybody in denver is
8377504 every time id go to another school district id want to get back to mapleton theres something magical about the community this is my home my family my parents still live down the street this is not a place i want to visit ive planted roots
8377505 being a public school educator my whole life i had this attitude about charter schools
8377506 we visited a lot of them and it changed our view there were some amazing charter schools and some very dedicated people who were in it for the right reasons that challenged us to think outside what we traditionally think of as a public school
8377507 we were looking at where is it working where is it great we used the philosophy that we would stand on the shoulders of giants and start where others had left off
8377508 then we matched what we heard in our community with what we saw so if our community said we want technology to be a focus for our kids we matched a tech school with that we heard the arts were an important piece so we wanted a school focused on arts we were also deliberate in making sure all our schools use their model as a means to a common end which was college readiness
8377509 most school districts have to chunk the work a little bit
8377510 they do a high school and dabble a little bit in middle school and cant get to elementary and most have a complement of charter schools
8377511 i dont really place any specific blame on anybody except me
8377512 people would say he just wants attention and that doesnt really bother me because i do
8377513 dialogue about racism or injustices is inherently good and a good way to get people to participate in that is to make the dialogue humorous and thats what i tried to do
8377514 it doesnt have the things that i dont like about boulder it doesnt have that thinly veiled hyper conservative attitude or the fact that everybody is white and the unfriendly attitudes toward anybody whos gay or different in any way id rather go to a place that actually has real diversity instead of listening to a lot of rich white people talk about diversity

8377519 what are you doing up here you are under arrest
8377520 look my parents live the key to the apartment i can go down and let you in
8377521 if you dont have photo id to prove that you live here we have to arrest you and if you dont have proof that you live here and that your family lives here we have to issue you a ticket

8377527 mccain 2008 and claim to be hillary supporters disrespect her and everything she stands for everything she has fought for and everything she believes in
8377528 mccain 2008 hillary 2012 do not care about the families and the children who will need healthcare between 2008 and 2012
8377529 mccain 2008 are republicans there is no place for shortsighted hatred and a thirst for vengeance in the democratic party that is the drug that the republicans peddle
8377530 i will now vote for mccain and more of the same but its better that being taxed by a democrate

8377547 we are honored by this important recognition from an expert north american media organization
8377548 following in the footsteps of the highly inspirational aero x and the 9 4x biopower crossover concept which also debuted earlier this year the 9 x biohybrid demonstrates that saab is truly on the move
8377549 this car is all about efficiency in design and performance
8377550 you could say we designed this car from back to front
8377551 the shape of the 9x is right for a car of this size and the longer roof line helps the aerodynamics as well as providing more rear headroom and interior space

8377625 the federal government is not investing enough in our infrastructure
8377626 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8377627 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8377628 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8377629 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8377630 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8377631 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8377632 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8377633 eso es lo que se utilizar para construir las nuevas plantas y actualizar las plantas viejas

8377739 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8377740 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8377741 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8377742 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8377768 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8377769 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8377770 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8377776 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8377777 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8377778 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8377779 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8377780 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8377781 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8377782 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8377783 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8377824 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8377825 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8377832 i think you have to show something beyond what might happen
8377833 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8377834 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8377835 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8377836 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8377837 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8377838 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8377839 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8377840 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8377841 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8377842 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8377843 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8377844 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8377845 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8377846 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8377847 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8377848 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8377849 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8377850 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8377851 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8377852 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8377853 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8377854 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8377855 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8377856 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8377857 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8377862 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

8377864 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8377865 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8377866 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8377867 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8377868 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8377869 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8377870 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8377871 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8377915 with polls finding the economy the number one issue across the land voters are starved for a convincing story about how each candidate would restore broadly shared prosperity
8377916 voters dont want a laundry list they do want some specifics that would make a real difference plus they want an overall vision that restores confidence in the possibility of a better future weve prepared a speech that outlines how america could create a moral economy that delivers economically and sustains rather than undermines families and communities we encourage both candidates to take freely from it

8377921 the expansion that began in november 2001 was characterized by slow employment growth and the share of the population employed failed to reach the levels achieved in the late 1990s
8377922 weakness in the labor market translated into anemic wage growth that failed to even keep pace with inflation
8377923 with both wages and home prices falling and savings rates close to zero families are being squeezed in a way that is likely to depress consumption spending in the months ahead
8377924 and since consumption spending makes up about 70 percent of the gross domestic product this does not bode well for the broader economy

8377928 there is no substitute for the personal touch and one on one relationship building between buyers and sellers that takes place at a show everywhere i went on the show floor i heard optimism and more importantly saw a lot of sales being closed for the fall and the upcoming holiday selling season
8377929 the great thing about this show is the sophistication of the buyer and of course youre in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with great restaurants and great accessibility

8377971 overall the game plays great the controls work perfectly whether youre an avid baseball fan or a newcomer picking up the game for the first time and if youre a n00b several tutorials are available to help you out only two things hold mario super sluggers back from diamond domination first despite having a terrific control scheme and lots of options its really just another mario licensed sports game if youre looking for something past that try mlb power pros 2008 instead second there are no online options it wouldve been great to form a league with your friends through the wi fi connection but youll have to settle for offline play
8377972 this baseball diamond loses some of its luster with occasionally confusing or clunky play its too easy to accidentally pitch or swing prematurely but the games simplified approach is great for sports curious gamers looking to avoid the complexities of a real simulation
8377973 super sluggers succeeds and fails as most mario sports games do its quick arcade style action is easy to get into and plenty fun coming at the expense of the nuances and balance youll find in a sim

8377986 i wanted to make the film and the facts about the occupation of iraq accessible to a larger group of people my hope is that this will contribute to the process of making better foreign policy decisions moving forward in iraq and elsewhere during this election year its important to examine the leadership mentality and policies that caused iraq to descend into such a horrific state that after 4 000 american deaths at least a quarter million iraqis killed 4 million refugees and over 2 trillion spent iraq remains in a state of near collapse
8377987 in recognition of the film as timely work that clearly illuminates the misguided policy decisions that have led to the catastrophic quagmire of the us invasion and occupation of iraq

8377990 we are honored by this important recognition from an expert north american media organization
8377991 following in the footsteps of the highly inspirational aero x and the 9 4x biopower crossover concept which also debuted earlier this year the 9 x biohybrid demonstrates that saab is truly on the move
8377992 this car is all about efficiency in design and performance
8377993 you could say we designed this car from back to front
8377994 the shape of the 9x is right for a car of this size and the longer roof line helps the aerodynamics as well as providing more rear headroom and interior space
8377995 this car shows how our concept work can be carried forward into a compact format
8377996 it has a number of features which we will be developing further such as the new driver focused design theme the importance of clean uncluttered surfaces and the easy seamless connectivity inside the car
8377997 it is an honor to be nominated by a group of americans who have served our country so well and who work hard each day to secure our future
8377998 we have all come from different places in our lives but we are united in our desire for change senator salazar has led the way in the west with a results oriented leadership style that puts people first representatives wasserman schultz and davis represent the next generation of leaders in this country who are changing the way our government helps americans michael wilson served his country in iraq and has helped advocate for change in our foreign policy
8377999 as we move forward from this convention unified and ready to elect senator obama the next president i will forever be proud of the diversity of our delegation we have delegates ranging in age from 17 to their late 80s and represent every walk of life and every corner of america i want to thank them for their support and hard work on behalf of my campaign and the democratic party

8378003 the teams achievement sets the stage for the next series of tests eventually leading to maximum speed it also sparks the imagination for what ultimately the technology can mean to the future of the rotorcraft industry we are far from having a product but closer than ever to realizing the potential
8378004 we pioneer flight solutions that bring people home everywhere every time tm
8378005 despite the black cloud hanging over the mortgage industry the california association of mortgage brokers camb annual convention held august 6th 9th in sacramento was a success
8378006 to have a forum like this that mortgage brokers can come together and collaborate and share survival strategies is vital i believe in and support what camb is doing for our industry that is why it was important to me that american pacific mortgage contribute as much as possible
8378007 i wouldnt have missed this event for anything the learnings that you take away from a camb convention are important even in a good market in a market like this they are crucial
8378008 never before in my 20 years in the business has our industry organization been so relevant it is very possible that without the lobbying done by camb and other industry organizations mortgage brokers would go extinct only by banding together can we keep our industry viable
8378009 this ruling is an important victory for the safety of our families and communities we should not make it easier for dangerous domestic violence abusers to obtain dangerous firearms

8378015 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8378016 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8378017 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8378018 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas

8378053 lo que dije fue que me ten a que plantear muchas cosas porque fue un fracaso personal no llegar a la final ya que estuve cerca de 12 meses preparando los juegos y por tanto cuando no salen bien las cosas la decepci n es grande
8378054 el balance de la temporada no est tan mal porque estuve por encima de los 20 metros casi siempre

8378064 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8378065 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8378066 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8378067 im sure there are other cases of hidden people in the rural areas

8378070 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8378071 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8378072 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8378073 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8378074 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8378075 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8378076 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8378077 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8378078 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8378079 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8378080 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be

8378089 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8378090 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8378091 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8378092 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8378093 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8378102 im very optimistic we managed to get by with only losing two birds and we have had a great response from our donors we are very focused said kelly sorenson executive director of the ventana wildlife society a non profit group that has released condors in big sur since 1997
8378103 condor sanctuary a remote outpost where condors were regularly treated for medical problems fitted with radio transmitters and released
8378104 theyre all doing great they all are still in good health george said
8378105 i dont think there will be any long term impact he added it was a stressful couple of days for them but they settled into our site pretty well and started to exhibit normal behavior pretty soon
8378106 we think the fire or the smoke overtook them the bodies were never recovered but its been long enough now that we presume they are dead
8378107 its encouraging to me how well the birds survived during the fire sorenson said
8378108 not only can they deal with fire when it is occurring but it gives us some foreshadowing that the condors can survive on their own when we are ready

8378132 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8378133 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8378134 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8378135 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8378136 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8378137 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8378138 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8378139 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8378140 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8378141 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8378142 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8378143 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8378144 i dont think were anticipating its going to be at a level thats going to be a big problem
8378145 a distribution must involve a sale or other transfer of ownership or a rental lease or lending of a copy of the work the recording companies have not proved an actual distribution of 42 of the copyrighted sound recordings at issue so their motion for summary judgement fails as to those recordings
8378146 defendants intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach
8378147 the deliberate destruction by itself compels the conclusion that such evidence supported plaintiffs case

8378168 i believe that we can actually find a way of reducing our sales tax our overall rate by broadening the sales tax because it doesnt make any sense to have the industries that are shrinking industries take the brunt of paying all this and those that are expanding businesses like for instance service oriented businesses or internet and all of this not paying for it

8378179 and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
8378180 i havent done any of these things by wagering money
8378181 perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself
8378182 gain of money not worked for is not godliness nor acceptable with the lord his truth is everlasting and will never be removed his word is from everlasting to everlasting yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant
8378183 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
8378184 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god

8378196 that is a huge raise to get all at once i would be open to a more modest and incremental increase for the attorney general
8378197 when the average taxpayer family gets a raise it is small i dont know anyone who has ever received at 54 percent raise
8378198 its just going to further alienate the public and show that the politicians run business on a different level playing field than the average worker does
8378199 are they incapable of taking a small raise they should follow the private sector model and make raises more modest and incremental
8378200 the public may be very welcome to bring judges up to level
8378201 politicians dont deserve any raises because all they been doing is raising our taxes

8378267 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes
8378268 but in a slow economy theres just no room for what we were paying for our private health insurance 2 000 every 6 months in premiums with a 30 copay 10 prescription copay and 1 000 deductible for each family member did i mention that both boys were on 4 6 rounds of antibiotics before getting tubes last year

8378310 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8378311 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8378312 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8378313 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8378314 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8378315 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8378316 obama will make it a top priority of his administration to protect social security benefits for current and future beneficiaries alike
8378317 and he does not believe it is necessary or fair to hard working seniors to raise the retirement age

8378326 its something that usually happens after some type of immersion into water there are natural reflexes in the body that cause the opening to the airway to shut off its a reflex to keep fluid and things out of the lungs
8378327 when that shuts off and the person is still trying to breathe the diaphragm is still moving and it creates a lot of negative pressure inside the lungs what that does is damage the air sacks and the alveoli and the capillaries in the lungs
8378328 damage that occurred from that serious negative pressure allows fluid from the bloodstream to leak out of the capillaries and into the lungs and that happens over several hours
8378329 and thats what causes the oxygen problem and the quote drownings
8378330 just breathing in a little water and having a choking episode lots of people have done that the body usually absorbs that water rather quickly

8378355 defending the nations core values its organizing ideology and its free political and economic institutions
8378356 is far too deeply entrenched in americas political culture and foreign policy tradition to be dismissed
8378357 but wrights latest round of media appearances have not seemed to me to be any kind of defense of liberalism or the black church or even black liberation theology so much as one mans desire to deny a rival his destiny
8378358 the open door is as much about ideology as it is about economic expansion and the distribution of power in the international system

8378460 i care enough about black young boys and girls that i have actually won volunteer of the year at the local boys and girls club teen center here in raleigh yea by volunteering i remember a teenage black girl after seeing me in the center after several days asking me why i was there before i could answer she followed the question with a quick quip what you gotta do community service when i told her that i was just there as a volunteer she put a bewildered look on her face that struck home with me bill the teen center manager would soon tell me that volunteers at the center are few and far between one day while signing in on the volunteer log i noticed that only i had signed in as a volunteer for the past several weeks that the log displayed this spoke directly to what bill had told me i know i know give me a hero cookie right the only reason im mentioning this is to qualify that im no hypocrite but i surely do have a way of viewing a lot of black people who chime in on the topic of black unity as hypocrites what i find is that most of them will write something or take a position in conversations like brothapeacemaker has when the facts are that they themselves are all talk no action
8378461 this is why i care brothapeacemaker while working in the teen center there were some rough looking young men in there i mean to the common white person and even some blacks they looked like thugs im from a city that is 95 or more black these were the bay bays and shine dogs that i grew up with when i was a young kid i saw the kid in these teens after they get to know you a little the tough shield starts to dissipate and whats really there is a teenage kid that has hopes and dreams that are constantly being challenged by our culture

8378553 la russia ha detto peshkov accoglier con calore ogni decisione di altri paesi di riconoscere labkhazia e lossezia del sud come ha chiesto il presidente russo dimitri medvedev purtroppo molti sono rimasti silenziosi quando la georgia ha dato il via al conflitto
8378554 la situazione pericolosa innanzitutto perch i russi sono conseguenti con quanto hanno dichiarato allindomani del riconoscimento del kosovo si giustificano facendo riferimento al riconoscimento dellindipendenza del kosovo con il quale sono stati modificato in qualche modo i criteri abituali di diritto internazionale ebbene hanno risposto noi applicheremo questo stesso criterio in abkhazia e ossezia fatti salvi alcuni atteggiamenti frettolosi se non pienamente ineccepibili utilizzati da sakashvili e dalle autorit georgiane se per un attimo ci fermiamo a considerare sia laspetto della sproporzione della reazione russa che quello dellimmediato riconoscimento di abkhazia e ossezia capiamo che questo non pu essere di per s frutto della stessa crisi ma che era stato preparato tutto prima c una strategia una regia in una partita di questo genere questo va ricollegato a un intendimento che di gran lunga trascende quella che lentit reale della crisi e per questo non ha torto il ministro francese quando immagina che non ci si voglia fermare ad abkhazia e ossezia il problema anche un altro nella logica dei russi questo tentativo non fatto per scoprire fino a che punto la russia in grado di arrivare ma pi che altro per capire fin dove si sente di arrivare la nato questo per altro lo stesso atteggiamento che non la russia di medvedev e putin ma l unione sovietica aveva al tempo della guerra fredda quando apriva continuamente crisi regionali in nome della diffusione del verbo del comunismo anche allora con lutilizzo di suggestioni legate allandare in soccorso di governi o di minoranze che si ispiravano al socialismo mentre oggi loccasione data dalla comunanza di tipo linguistico culturale

8378599 wenn der westen die unabh ngigkeit kosovos anerkennt dann antwortet moskau indem es die widerborstigen kleinen separatistengebiete und russisch bewohnten st dte ums schwarze meer f rdert bis hin zur anerkennung ihrer eigenstaatlichkeit
8378600 russland sponsert diese gebiete in der ukraine moldawien aserbaidschan und georgien schon lange
8378601 moskau hat durch den kaukasuskrieg vielleicht seinen ruf im westen weiter besch digt machte aber erhebliche fortschritte bei der imperialen eingemeindung des s dlichen kaukasus in russlands vorgarten
8378602 entweder ihr seid f r uns oder ihr seid gegen uns

8378604 sie bewiesen damit vor den weit aufgerissenen augen der welt dass es nicht den islam braucht um kriege anzuzetteln sondern vor allem ethnische gegens tze und die nationalistischen ambitionen gro er und kleiner m chte
8378605 jetzt k nnen sie nur noch zuschauen und fragen warum das passieren
8378606 f llt etwas auf die islamisten waren dabei v llig abwesend
8378607 f llt etwas auf die islamisten waren dabei v llig abwesend

8378620 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8378621 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8378622 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8378623 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8378624 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8378625 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8378626 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8378627 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8378628 the ninth inning was the smile on the mona lisa
8378629 she was being screened by airport security when a small amount of what appeared to be heroin and cocaine were found on her person she was arrested at 10 00 a m and is still in custody
8378630 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president

8378640 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
8378641 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
8378642 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
8378643 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
8378644 there were certain legal procedures that the hospital should have followed that they bypassed
8378645 we have worked with the individual who has had primary decision making responsibility for the patient

8378650 it is an honor to be nominated by a group of americans who have served our country so well and who work hard each day to secure our future
8378651 we have all come from different places in our lives but we are united in our desire for change senator salazar has led the way in the west with a results oriented leadership style that puts people first representatives wasserman schultz and davis represent the next generation of leaders in this country who are changing the way our government helps americans michael wilson served his country in iraq and has helped advocate for change in our foreign policy
8378652 n o tive a chance de fazer uma cena do jeito que estava escrita no roteiro ou do jeito que queria o script n o foi respeitado produtores ruins parceiros ruins foi uma experi ncia terr vel

8378660 you know that sometimes people buy great houses and have no taste
8378661 well we have no taste so we put it in the hands of someone who does
8378662 well in a cruel twist of irony or something after two years spent painstakingly implementing perfectly detailed jamie drake decor including a gold leaf bar our daughter was admitted to a great k on the upper west side and two weeks of cross park commuting for summer camp was a logistics nightmare since k are too big for strollers so we actually listed our place for sale at a relative bargain compared to chanos so it seems the 15 years ahead of two kids commuting cross the park and the fact that i will inevitably end up working for a media co somewhere on the west side it seemed better to just suck it up and move now rather than later i am not a well woman i have fantasies about the 15 minute commute on the amsterdam express bus but jamie drake has assured me he can build another gold leaf bar in our next home
8378663 the gallup daily is the worst thing thats happened in journalism in 20 years
8378664 when you have a major disturbance like bleaching it can affect a huge area of the reef
8378665 if you have extensive reserve systems then the chances are much higher they will contain small areas within that escape bleaching which can help to recharge the reef as a whole
8378666 the great barrier reef marine park authority have put a lot of effort into determining exactly where these protected zones should be located to give the reef the best over chance of recovery from bleaching events
8378667 new protected zones need to focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8378668 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8378669 these changes are substantial for some groups and indicate that little insurance is offered by current small scale nta management across the region
8378670 we detected declines in fish species richness across the western indian ocean in response to loss of live coral cover the one main exception is mombasa marine national park kenya where species richness and fish density have increased owing to management action
8378671 geography seems to be a key determinant in the ability of reefs to absorb and recover from such large scale disturbances and this should be considered for other regions likely to suffer similar large scale disturbances in the future
8378672 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8378673 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8378674 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8378675 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8378676 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8378677 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8378678 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8378679 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8378680 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8378681 see im not hurt i can go get my work done
8378682 to be honest were sort of like the military you know when the going gets tough the tough get going
8378683 mira yo se de nuestro trato cama sin compromisos pero soy mujer y lamentablemente las mujeres metemos en la cama tambien al corazon hoy me doy cuenta de que por vos siento amor y me duele tanto que me hables de la fulanita quedan 2 caminos o somos amigos y me contas tu vida o somos amantes amandonos al estar juntos sin que exista el afuera

8378692 the jazz network has been amazingly great for me and my music ive also discovered some very talented individuals here on the jazz network and reconnected with old friends and fans jaijai did an incredible thing when she created this awesome network im extremely proud to be a member of the jazz network and to turn my friends and colleagues onto it
8378693 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
8378694 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
8378695 total monthly online revenue for the entire public newspaper industry amount ed to approximately 15 of googles monthly us revenue
8378696 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis
8378697 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
8378698 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
8378699 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
8378700 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource
8378701 when peoples access to clean drinking water is reliant on the profit interests of a handful of transnationals all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty
8378702 tanto significa para nosotros y para nuestra continuidad pues supone un gran esfuerzo humano y t cnico afrontarlo pero nos vale para evidenciar que al no estar en la vuelta a espa a se puede completar un m s que digno papel en el calendario internacional
8378703 look im a sailor and were off to europe tomorrow and i can stow you away on my ship ill take care of you bring you food every day and keep you happy

8378709 i would like to evaluate mequons experiences with this new ordinance for awhile
8378710 having said that i know there are municipalities who have adopted these types of ordinances and the law has changed last year to accommodate that
8378711 knowing chief graff from mequon pd i am sure his research was thorough and well thought out
8378712 personnel from the division of local government and school accountability have informed me that the audit has not been completed yet vve sic will notify you when the audit is released
8378713 we are looking into this for you thank you for your patience
8378714 if circumstances prevent disclosure to the person requesting the record or records within twenty business days from the date of the acknowledgment of the receipt of the request the agency shall state in writing both the reason for the inability to grant the request within twenty business days and a date certain within a reasonable period depending on the circumstances when the request will be granted in whole or in part
8378715 although you indicated that your search was unsuccessful our search of the comptrollers website revealed an executive summary and a 23 page audit of the city of north tonawanda school district we have enclosed a paper copy of these documents for your records
8378716 this will confirm that i sent you a copy of an audit report in error please excuse the oversight and note that this does not change the substance of the advisory opinion issued
8378717 we can cross here were in a marked safety zone
8378718 apparently ive slept with half of hollywood you say hi nice to meet you the next day in the papers youre pregnant with his child
8378719 is a bigger animal than i ever will be it just becomes this soap opera and i guess i had a pretty good few episodes you feel like its a video sometimes i play these games to make it more amusing like im lara croft or something so i find myself ducking behind cars
8378720 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles
8378721 its like a roller coaster ride shes a person who is highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8378722 at 15 she had a huge breakdown and had to return home to louisiana
8378723 she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8378724 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person
8378725 shes on a temporary high right now but shes never really dealt with all the problems she had i dont think its possible to turn over a new leaf just like that
8378726 in fact shes nicer than most of the stars ive met but as britney once told me herself her life has always been two steps forward followed by one step back
8378727 we cant all be winners because someone has to sit on the curb and clap as we go by
8378728 we call on the nation of latin america and the caribbean to join us in laying the groundwork for a democratic cuba looking for the inevitable day of liberation we support restrictions on trade with and travel to cuba as a measure of solidarity with the political prisoners and all the oppressed cuban people we call for a dedicated platform for the transmissions of radio and television marti into cuba and to prepare for the day when cuba is free we support the work of the commission for assistance to a free cuba we affirm the principles of the cuban adjustment act of 1996 recognizing the rights of cubans fleeing communist tyranny and support efforts to admit more of them trough a safe legal orderly process
8378729 i have lived inside the monster and i know its entrails
8378730 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
8378731 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
8378732 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
8378733 you cant build a reputation on what you are going to do
8378734 go through all 141332 frames manually and delete those that are dupes
8378735 no financial incentive for fidelity to promote auction rate securities as opposed to other short term investments
8378736 on a beautiful clear spring morning joseph smith went to the woods and found a quiet spot where he could be alone then he knelt and began to pray no sooner had he done so than an overwhelming feeling of darkness swept over him as if some evil power was trying to overcome him rather than surrender joseph prayed harder and god himself answered his prayer joseph described what happened this way i saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun which descended gradually until it fell upon me

8378748 if if you still dont believe me then then ill let you check
8378749 determine the most viable alignment for the corridor between highway 91 and highway 15 for a high standard 80 km h four lane facility with accesses restricted to appropriately spaced and located signalized intersections which in the long term are proposed to be converted to interchanges
8378750 it would not provide for goods leaving the lower mainland i e requiring access to highway 1 nor would it address the 50 of goods that move by truck or traffic bound for the ferry terminal
8378751 the consulting team has researched and analyzed the opportunities for such an integrated facility the commercial advantages of this concept and for a location with adjacent or nearby container businesses are primarily related to the savings in drayage trucking costs around and amongst the congested road network of the region
8378752 the comparison leads to the following preliminary conclusions at barge load volumes of 100 containers per round trip short sea service is at a distinct pricing disadvantage compared with truck transport at barge load volumes of 200 containers per round trip i e 100 containers each way short sea services on all routes become more price competitive and on selected routes become directly competitive with truck transport and as barge load volumes increase to 200 containers and higher per round trip short sea services are expected to offer price advantages versus truck transport on some routes and become directly price competitive on other selected routes
8378753 bei solchen anl ssen kein bier das ist ja eine katastrophe

8378765 unabh ngig von dem beispiel das der westen durch die anerkennung des kosovos gesetzt hat die abtr nnigen georgischen staaten trennt nur ein bergzug von russlands eigenen separatistischen brennpunkten wenn abchasien oder s dossetien nationalstaaten sind wieso gilt das nicht f r tschetschenien wichtiger als die abstimmung des parlaments ist medwedews gestrige bemerkung dass das abbrechen aller beziehungen zur nato kein gro er verlust f r russland w re nur anhaltender internationaler druck kann russland zwingen sich auf die positionen vor dem 7 august zur ckzuziehen als georgische truppen s dossetien attackierten der kann jetzt nur von frankreich und deutschland kommen jenen l ndern die sich dem us amerikanischen verlangen nach einer georgischen nato mitgliedschaft widersetzten
8378766 eine offizielle abtrennung abchasiens und ossetiens w re eine weitere erniedrigung des georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili der ein entschiedener bef rworter der unabh ngigkeit georgiens ist und den moskau st rzen will um an seine stelle einen russlandabh ngigen politiker wie dessen vorg nger eduard schewardnadse zu setzen dies ist auch ein weiterer schritt zum wiederaufbau des imperiums und gleichzeitig eine blockade der alternativen brennstoffquellen f r europa die vom kaspischen meer ber georgien in den westen flie en trotz der aufm pfigen erkl rungen moskaus kann der westen darunter auch die eu die russischen pl ne durchkreuzen vorausgesetzt jedoch dass er sich aufrafft also als erstes berhaupt die gefahr erkennt polen kann dabei eine bedeutende rolle bernehmen wenn die au enpolitik der staatsr son untergeordnet wird und der pr sident und der premier in der lage sein werden sich diesbez glich zu einigen
8378767 abchasen und s dosseten haben sich l ngst von georgien losgesagt und regierungen gew hlt aber die grenzen georgiens aus dem beide territorien nun herausoperiert werden galten als verbindlich das abzusichern hat frankreichs pr sident nicolas sarkozy bei seinem j ngsten trip unterlassen eine klausel ber die integrit t des georgischen staats brachte er nicht mit das war ein freibrief f r moskau letzten endes f r die annektion fremden landes ein unerh rter vorgang eigentlich w re da nicht der pr zedenzfall kosovo man m sste russland als singul r imperialistisch brandmarken
8378768 das votum beider russischer parlamentskammern fiel wie zu udssr zeiten aus absolute einstimmigkeit sowohl im f derationsrat als auch in der duma es ist schon ein sprechendes zeichen dass selbst die leblose russische opposition der meinung ist dass die anerkennung beider republiken eine bedeutung f r die russische f deration hat das votum verpflichtet zu nichts premier putin hat weiter freie hand wie er damit umzugehen gedenkt doch der premier pr sident russlands hat damit alles was er braucht eine neue w hrung um mit dem westen zu verhandeln und das recht von der russischen legislative waffen und soldaten in den separatistischen provinzen zu stationieren es ist noch unklar wie die zukunft der beiden besch tzten regionen dem wirtschaftsreservat von m tterchen russland aussehen wird derzeit l sst sich vermuten dass es zum paradies f r waffen und illegalen handel wird fernab der nato besonders schlimm ist dass dies alles im nordkaukasus passiert einer bedeutenden gegend f r die energiesicherheit europas
8378769 in zwei jahren d rfte in ungarn mit viktor orb n ein ebensolcher populist wie fico die wahlen gewinnen eine schlimmere slowakisch ungarische konstellation ist kaum vorstellbar in dieser zeit k nnte in tschechien ficos freund ji paroubek ein gegner des us raketenschirms regieren und pr sident w re dann immer noch v clav klaus der ebenfalls russlands vorgehen gegen georgien unterst tzt die russen brauchen nur geduldig warten bis von allein eintritt was sie schon in den 1990er jahren versuchten die spaltung mitteleuropas
8378770 falls es irgendeinen zweifel ber die motivation russlands gab den krieg mit georgien zu f hren wurde er gestern ausger umt der russische pr sident dmitri medwedew hat die unabh ngigkeit von s dossetien und abchasien anerkannt es ist allen klar dass diese entscheidung schon beim einrollen der russischen panzer in dieses land feststand europa und seine verb ndeten stehen in der pflicht die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu verteidigen eines demokratischen nachbarns dem man dringend das tor zur nato ffnen muss au erdem m ssen die f hrungskr fte der eu von worten zu taten bergehen und sehr viel h rtere ma nahmen ergreifen solange moskau nicht auf den weg der legalit t zur ckkehrt
8378771 die anerkennung abchasiens und s dossetiens als selbstst ndige staaten durch russlands pr sidenten macht eine verhandlungsl sung in georgien noch schwieriger stellt sie doch die vermittelnden m chte also die mehrheit der eu staaten vor vollendete tatsachen immerhin hatte der sechs punkte plan der eu gespr che dar ber vorgesehen wie sicherheit und stabilit t in abchasien und s dossetien hergestellt werden k nnten solche verhandlungen k nnen jetzt als einmischung in die inneren angelegenheiten zur ckgewiesen werden auch eine durch den weltsicherheitsrat zu beschlie ende friedensmission der uno liegt jetzt in weiter ferne aber jetzt die verhandlungen ber die georgienkrise einzustellen und auf eine allgemeine konfrontationslinie zu russland einzuschwenken w re ein fataler fehler
8378772 was aber wollen die europ er der russischen f hrung berhaupt beweisen sanktionen oder eine eiszeit werde es nicht geben haben bernard kouchner und angela merkel der franz sische au enminister und die deutsche kanzlerin schon angek ndigt zu wichtig ist russland als gesch ftspartner die gefahr ist dagegen gro dass die 27 mit gro em pomp der welt ihre uneinigkeit und entschlusslosigkeit zeigen es w re ja nicht das erste mal der eu sondergipfel zur lage in georgien kann zu einem moralischen appell werden einer gemeinsamen besinnung auf den wert der politischen freiheit einer solidarit tsbekundung f r ein land das teil der nachbarschaftspolitik der union ist
8378773 die einen erkl ren es sei kl ger den russischen b r zu beruhigen die anderen behaupten dass er unbedingt in schach gehalten werden muss die stimme der ersten l sst sich vor allem im alten europa h ren die zweiten befinden sich mehrheitlich in gro britannien sowie in polen und anderen l ndern europas die das sowjetische joch erleiden mussten die auseinandersetzung ist noch nicht abgehakt aber ohne zweifel hat europa ein russisches problem der moskauer imperialismus ist sogar eine der wichtigsten herausforderungen der es anfang dieses jahrhunderts begegnen muss
8378774 eine der lektionen aus dem konflikt um s dossetien ist dass ethnische konflikte an der russisch europ ischen grenze extrem gef hrlich sind eine situation die einerseits slowenien kroatien bosnien mazedonien und den kosovo im europ ischen raum und andererseits serbien als vasallenstaat von moskau beinhaltet ist ein rezept f r unheil solange die russisch europ ische bruchlinie quer durch die serbische w hlerschaft verl uft und die pro europ ische regierungskoalition in belgrad unstabil ist darf man keine risiken eingehen die niederlande m ssen dar ber nachdenken ob die auslieferung von zwei kriegsverbrechern von h herem nationalen interesse ist als die sicherheit an der europ ischen ostgrenze
8378775 v lkerrechtlern stehen im georgien konflikt die haare zu berge es ist unfassbar wie wenig rechts argumente noch gelten widerspr che ohne ende wie eu und usa die unabh ngigkeit des kosovo begr ndeten was moskau dagegen sagte und wie beide seiten nun ber eine abspaltung s dossetiens und abchasiens von georgien reden was im kosovo g ltig war ist es in georgien nicht mehr und umgekehrt das ist das ersch tternde an der gegenw rtigen krise in europa es gelten keine politischen grunds tze das eigene handeln wird begr ndet wie es gerade beliebt wenn sie schon nicht zu einer neuen partnerschaft finden k nnen so tun eu und russland gut daran wenigstens zur basis der 1990er jahre zur ckzukehren nderungen der politischen landkarte europas nur im u ersten fall und nur auf friedlichem weg die art und weise wie pr sident medwedew entgegen aller warnungen die unabh ngigkeit s dossetiens und abchasiens anerkannte l sst allerdings nichts gutes f r die zukunft der beziehungen eu russland erwarten
8378776 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall

8378788 there are an immense number of sellers rushing in with large technical muscle but with no idea how to retain clients
8378789 i think 2008 is a particularly exciting election year with much to study analyze and understand
8378790 the nomination process the campaign process campaign financing the role of the media polling and the electoral college
8378791 the basic aspect of any place is that it is a place and that there is a way to speak about it
8378792 recognizing the natural order of the place and allowing people to tell their story is empowering
8378793 businesses cant be successful without great leaders who are adept at navigating change
8378794 and everyone benefits from the shared ideas relevant to their situation
8378795 passionate concern for blending the built environment with the natural setting of the city

8378801 this nation is going to go the way florida new mexico nevada and colorado go and thats the latino vote
8378802 before the road to the white house could have been ohio pennsylvania nevada i think this time its going to be the southwestern united states and florida and the latino vote is going to be decisive
8378803 i think all we have to do is to know senator obama
8378804 i think he needs to just tell his story of struggle
8378805 i think theres still a little skepticism about what has he done for hispanics what has he done for the country
8378806 mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
8378807 for all the speeches in denver touting clean energy as the key to saving americas economy and the future of the planet theres still one unmoveable object standing in the way congress
8378808 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
8378809 how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them
8378810 but it is a bipartisan start on the road to a comprehensive energy strategy leading our nation to independence from foreign oil
8378811 willing to consider offshore drilling but that is not the long term solution
8378812 we lack a national energy policy to our detriment as a country

8378819 angesichts der vielf ltigen informationsquellen auf die kunden bei ihren kaufentscheidungen zur ckgreifen k nnen als auch vor dem hintergrund einer h heren preissensibilit t und einer geringeren empf nglichkeit f r werbebotschaften ist es immer schwieriger kunden zu gewinnen und zu halten viele unternehmen versuchen diese bewanderten und gut informierten verbraucher mit einem mittelm igen benutzererlebnis zu k dern was einfach nicht funktionieren kann deshalb m ssen unternehmen das kundenerlebnis das sie dem verbraucher bieten deutlich verbessern

8378821 the dual role of ap washington bureau chief and political writer has long roots in ap history as well as that of other washington bureaus walter mears who won a pulitzer for his 1976 presidential coverage served in both capacities from 1977 to 1984 as bureau chief he continued to write news copy usually analytical pieces likewise other leading news organizations have often had their bureau chiefs serve in both capacities
8378822 this finding has enormous impact both in terms of suffering and economics
8378823 we may have missed many older business travelers flying to europe or the usa
8378824 seems to make adaptive decisions about what to remember and what to forget
8378825 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
8378826 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold gt
8378827 the model of lending in which the originator of a loan sells it to various third parties known as the originate to distribute model became a popular vehicle for credit and liquidity risk management in recent years
8378828 however banks with aggressive involvement in this market had incentives to issue inferior quality mortgages this allowed them to benefit from the origination fees without bearing the credit risk of the borrowers
8378829 as long as the secondary market for mortgages was functioning normally they were able to easily offload these loans to third parties when the secondary mortgage market came under pressure in mid 2007 banks with lots of poor loans were stuck with them
8378830 poorly capitalized banks have higher risk seeking incentives due to the call option feature of equity enjoyed by shareholders of highly levered firms
8378831 the presence of subsidized deposit insurance can further exacerbate this effect thus otd loans issued by such banks can be potentially very risky
8378832 this fragility of a banks capital structure might act as a disciplining device by committing the banker to avoid risky behavior
8378833 the evidence confirms the popular belief that the lack of screening incentives created by separating the originator of a loan from the ultimate bearer of the default risk oupled with risk taking behavior ignificantly contributed to the current subprime mortgage crisis
8378834 from the markets perspective the probability of default on a mortgage loan partly depends on the originator of the loan itself from the regulators perspective the banks liability structure has a predictable effect on loan decisions
8378835 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8378836 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8378837 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
8378838 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
8378839 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
8378840 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces pancreatitis
8378841 you could be causing more trouble than what you started with
8378842 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
8378843 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues
8378844 all the didactic teaching in the classroom even meeting medical professionals that stuff fades with them over time
8378845 what stays with them over time is actually meeting an injured peer
8378846 we also uncovered themes related to their belief that they would be preferentially rescued or saved by the health care system if they were severely injured

8378882 today san francisco lost a local and national leader del martin
8378883 for over half a century del martin along with her loving spouse phyllis lyon served as an activist for womens rights and the lgbt community the marriage of del martin and phyllis lyon on june 16 2008 marked an historic milestone on our countrys road to true freedom and equality
8378884 del laid the groundwork for all those who want a life of dignity and we are forever in her debt
8378885 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all

8378907 nintendo is failing the core wii gamer regardless of what they say
8378908 back on the 64 did people say that nintendo were failing the core how about in the days of the cube no that statement was never made
8378909 nintendo is ignoring the hardcore all the hardcore games that came out within 6 months of each other awhile ago dont count because theyre in the past if they had spaced them out at least we would just be bitching about how they arent out yet if they werent ignoring the hardcore theyd make a new zelda and mario game every year since thats the time frame that other companies bungie squeenix etc release their brand new hardcore games
8378910 also name another time span that gave us mario kart zelda mario metroid and smash bros so released so closely to one another
8378911 no demographic should feel left out from our e3 showing
8378912 nintendo focusing on the expanded audience doesn t mean they don t care about the core

8378941 nothing provides the energy for imitation as much as success
8378942 to help identify and channel towards israeli agents hamas members who were dangerous terrorists
8378943 the thinking on the part of some of the right wing israeli establishment was that hamas and the others if they gained control would refuse to have any part of the peace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place
8378944 aided hamas directly the israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the plo palestinian liberation organization
8378945 was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong secular plo by using a competing religious alternative
8378946 nothing provides the energy for imitation as much as success
8378947 to help identify and channel towards israeli agents hamas members who were dangerous terrorists
8378948 the thinking on the part of some of the right wing israeli establishment was that hamas and the others if they gained control would refuse to have any part of the peace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place
8378949 israel would still be the only democracy in the region for the united states to deal with
8378950 the thing wrong with so many israeli operations is that they try to be too sexy
8378951 the israelis are their own worst enemies when it comes to fighting terrorism
8378952 the israelis are like a guy who sets fire to his hair and then tries to put it out by hitting it with a hammer
8378953 waaah dillekraant waah bullseye waaah you used sources waah waah waah waah waah
8378954 aided hamas directly the israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the plo palestinian liberation organization
8378955 the israeli government gives me a budget and we extend some financial aid to islamic groups via mosques and religious schools in order to help create a force that can stand up against the leftist forces that support the plo
8378956 it is hard to say which ideal gets trampled more by the lpgas new policy the spirit of golf or the spirit of america either way the womens professional golf tour has turned a no win situation into a big loss the gist is this the lpga worried about losing interest among fans and sponsors said it will suspend players who cant pass an english oral exam after two years on tour this appears aimed directly at south koreans who represent 45 of the 121 international players on the tour and who british womens open champion ji yai shin and u s womens open champion inbee park to name two are dominating

8379060 but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice what is so important is that at the end of today we will nominate barack obama and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
8379061 a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8379062 obama will be a president who can adapt to new situations as things change
8379063 america needs new leadership in the white house and that leader is barack obama

8379084 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8379085 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8379086 the oil companies are making huge profits when consumers are dinged at the pumps
8379087 its not the folks who are delivering fuel to canadians all over that are making money
8379088 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8379089 the price of diesel affects every economic sector because it affects public transportation it affects the cost of goods that are transported

8379101 we are pleased that we can join a company of sercos stature and success
8379102 we have had a tremendous track record during our ten year history and are very proud of the leading position we have achieved in the government services sector now is the right time to go to the next level so the services we provide to our customers are enhanced by the scale and global reach that serco can offer
8379103 serco and si international share the same commitment to excellent service and complement each other
8379104 on the other hand some action sequences are shot and edited in a way thats impossible to fully follow but everything is underscored with a fascinating subtext that blurs heroism with terrorism and bravery with torture
8379105 bale is grimly humourless as the tortured superhero suave as wayne savage in his costume the gruff voice he assumes as batman is an irritation
8379106 other reservations shouldnt nolan marvellous as his directing here is be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare why cant hollywood put a tenth as much of the craft and vim into its average releases as it does into what is ultimately only a superhero movie
8379107 this big bang finish which includes a topsy turvy image that poignantly suggests the world has been turned on its axis for good is sloppy at times visually incoherent yet touching mr nolan you learn likes to linger in the dark but he doesnt want to live there
8379108 much more serious in intent and message than 2005s batman begins dark knight would be fatally ponderous without ledgers nasty little sprite as it is the movie strains at its own wagnerian seams

8379118 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8379119 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team

8379124 we welcome derrick and will work hard to get him up to speed as quickly as possible
8379125 i know that derrick has been anxious to get here its good for him and also for us to have this done as we finish up the preseason and prepare to start the season

8379129 this is a momentous decision compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
8379130 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
8379131 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
8379132 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
8379133 it was accepted on behalf of the foreign secretary that bm binyam mohamed had established an arguable case i that over the period april 2002 to may 2004 he was first held by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or a court or tribunal in pakistan and then detained there or elsewhere by the united states until his arrival in guant namo bay in september 2004 ii that he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states during such detention and iii that he was subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
8379134 the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
8379135 that on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the sys security service facilitated it in the manner and to the extent described
8379136 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 2002 the court also concluded that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
8379137 uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
8379138 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant the british government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
8379139 could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of proceedings before the military commissions
8379140 the united kingdom armed forces are trained in the laws of armed conflict set out in the geneva conventions the joint services intelligence organisations training documentation states that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden a physical punishment of any sort b the use of stress positions c intentional sleep deprivations d withdrawal of food water or medical treatment and three other specified techniques
8379141 must have appreciated that it rendition was contrary to the rule of law
8379142 however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection
8379143 hooding withholding of blankets and sleep deprivation of a detainee in afghanistan
8379144 a united states official had referred to getting a detainee ready which appeared to involve sleep deprivation hooding and the use of stress positions
8379145 with regard to the status of the prisoners under the various geneva conventions and protocols all prisoners however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection you have commented on their treatment it appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards given that they are not within our custody or control the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this that said hmgs her majestys government stated commitment to human rights makes it important that the americans understand that we cannot be party to such ill treatment nor can we be seen to condone it

8379149 we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8379150 current news of gvax vital 2 phase 3 trial termination makes future development of the gvax prostate uncertain and adds additional developmental risk
8379151 we believe that there may be limited new news from the pipeline to provide catalysts for increased stock valuation until final data of vital 1 expected in the second half of 2009
8379152 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8379153 right now we feel like were going to let marcus williams handle the point
8379154 there will be a lot more discussion moving forward about that but we feel like well come up with a lot of different scenarios between coach don nelson and i the one thing we wont do is panic and do something just knee jerk
8379155 its not a good thing but again i think montas showed over the course of his short career his toughness and ability a lot of times to take some tough situations and make the best of them
8379156 this training camp was going to be an important part for his development no question its going to be pushed back obviously and weve just got to deal with that we dont think its a season ending injury but the time frame as we all know it fluctuates with various injuries
8379157 told me it was time to hand over the torch

8379193 the days he practiced out here was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8379194 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do

8379200 perhaps they should have told us about this but it was such a small deal would we have wanted a piece of it in hindsight sure but for every one of these successes there are a hundred failures

8379202 it looked like it was worth a flier so we invested personally and got lucky
8379203 she should be transferred to bellevue hospital for urgent medical and psychological treatment
8379204 she has been significantly traumatized and she needs immediate help
8379205 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive
8379206 we do know she was at bagram for a long time
8379207 it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
8379208 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
8379209 the violation of the rights of dr siddiqui and her children and countless other missing persons is squarely the responsibility of the government of pakistan there is enough evidence indicating that she was initially picked up by the intelligence agencies in pakistan therefore not only the government of the united states but also the government of pakistan must be made accountable for the crime
8379210 under afghan and international law ahmed siddiqui is too young to be treated as a criminal suspect
8379211 he should never have been transferred to the custody of afghanistans abusive intelligence agency

8379218 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8379219 severing out and excluding activities from its meeting rooms that it concludes are inherent elements of a religious service or elements that are quintessentially religious
8379220 a distinction the government and the courts are not competent to make
8379221 when a limited public forum is available for use by groups presenting any viewpoint however we would not find an establishment clause violation simply because only groups presenting a religious viewpoint have opted to take advantage of the forum at a particular time

8379255 albertas global reputation for nanotechnology research just became enhanced as we will now be recognized as a place for putting that technology on the store shelves and into peoples lives
8379256 this new centre the first of its kind in canada will give entrepreneurs a place to turn ideas into viable market ready products
8379257 the launch of acamp helps position western canada at the forefront of innovation and is an important milestone in albertas growing capacity for science and technology commercialization
8379258 in concordance with the canadas science and technology strategy mobilizing science and technology to canadas advantage our government is proud to contribute 3 5 million through its western diversification program to help alberta become a centre for nanotechnology development and production
8379259 its incredible the number of emerging technology companies in alberta with the potential to develop exciting new consumer products for world wide markets
8379260 alberta is a prime location for world class research and acamp can provide the means to turn research into viable products in fact we are already helping our clients produce marketable products to compete globally
8379261 acamp is the result of a collaborative effort between industry government and academia to create a platform for product development activities in the province
8379262 and we are very pleased to have obtained the services of ken brizel as the first ceo of acamp
8379263 we are very pleased to receive this sizeable follow on solar order in the rapidly growing asia pacific region which further demonstrates the increasing acceptance we are seeing for our solar products from our worldwide base of solar customers we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our marketing pipeline and opportunities to grow our solar business into fiscal 2009

8379266 barack obama and joe biden will offer a tough new foreign policy thats neither republican nor democrat that is a strong smart american foreign policy that makes us more secure at home and will advance our interests around the world john mccain represents more of the same failed foreign policy that has isolated us from the world
8379267 obviously were going to spend a good portion of this evening talking about the differences between these candidates on foreign policy theres huge differences in judgment and approach and so i think were going to have some very compelling people making a very crisp case that barack obama is not just ready to be but will be the better commander in chief
8379268 he brings credibility and a face that is welcome in the international community
8379269 i dont think obama has adequately explained why he passed over hillary clinton
8379270 its a once in a generation opportunity in some of these states
8379271 we dont have a worry in the world regarding candidates
8379272 obviously every campaign can have slightly different persuasion targets but in terms of turnout i think youre going to see an enormous amount of symmetry
8379273 probably the most precious thing in politics is rich targets
8379274 and we do a lot of work to try and figure out the best way to pick the lock with voters
8379275 i think both of us are going to work to drive turnout up among younger voters hispanic voters i think our lead among hispanic voters in new mexico is enormous and theres a huge number of unregistered hispanic voters

8379280 i believe barack obama is a man of his word
8379281 he gave his word iowa would remain first new hampshire second
8379282 he better keep his word he better keep his word
8379283 it is a matter of practice over years to always review the presidential calendar to see what went well and what didnt
8379284 i am absolutely confident with barack obama and joe biden in the white house two of the biggest fans of iowas first in the nation caucus and new hampshire it is all ok i dont feel threatened at all
8379285 there is a feeling some things can be done better
8379286 we dont want to throw the baby out with the bathwater we started overall too early iowa and new hampshire can go in february the other states in early march
8379287 as a lawyer and a skeptic by experience i will say i do not hear any promises on anything yet
8379288 i expect revolution is not what this commission is about
8379289 he said all we are going to talk about is when the window starts and how you do things after the window he said people at the front of the window will stay where they are
8379290 weve already gotten a great deal of market exposure as a result of our support and involvement
8379291 its always important to allow enough time to get into a venue
8379292 we understand the parameters of time in term of folks getting in to see the speeches and we will adjust if necessary
8379293 theres one tent id like to see a little bit larger and thats democrats on the fcc
8379294 if possible we shouldnt create unnecessary conflicts between our nominee and the platform
8379295 i dont think there is a stronger way to support our candidate than to support what people want
8379296 i came here to get john mccain elected president i want him to have a platform he can run on
8379297 as someone who rides the train every day sen biden has always been a champion for passenger rail and has been a key supporter of our bipartisan amtrak bill
8379298 senator biden is a longtime enthusiastic supporter of amtrak and a regular passenger riding frequently between his home in delaware and his office in washington
8379299 we would expect senator biden to continue his support if elected vice president
8379300 we just wanted to make sure we were bridging any kind of informational gaps
8379301 the country really needs a fresh approach to our national security challenges
8379302 the clinton message and the obama message were not terribly different
8379303 even if he wasnt running against john mccain he would have people like me there and he would be focusing on these same kinds of issues because theyre so tied to his platform
8379304 while on active duty i was very disappointed in a number of decisions rendered by the bush administration and their failure to support initiatives i considered very important including my own to develop the iraqi armed forces
8379305 duty bound to fill what i consider to be a role to stand up for a man who really does have the potential to get things turned around for the united states

8379308 right now theres a little issue on whether or not the opponents of the initiative measure have received or expended 100 000
8379309 we did make immediate assessments and also recommendations in ways to comply with the requirements of our regulatory agencies
8379310 the cost is much lower it gives the ag the ability to communicate to a larger number of people
8379311 let me just say that my office has received information of the airport trying to avoid the oversight by this committee but this committee and myself will not be detoured from exposing the alleged illegal activities as well as all the other alleged abuses that are happening at the airport
8379312 evidence and written submissions have been requested from each rider and a three member panel of the fei tribunal has been appointed
8379313 the panel will then in light of all the evidence received take a decision as to the applicable sanction if any
8379314 were aggressively looking for grow sites both on foot and in the air
8379315 we know from experience that growers are looking for rural somewhat desolate areas and we have a number of places like that in mchenry county
8379316 were finding more and more often theyre going into the woods because they know were looking for them from the air
8379317 were going to keep finding these grows were going to ruin these peoples business and were going to drive them out of the county

8379324 im very optimistic we managed to get by with only losing two birds and we have had a great response from our donors we are very focused said kelly sorenson executive director of the ventana wildlife society a non profit group that has released condors in big sur since 1997
8379325 condor sanctuary a remote outpost where condors were regularly treated for medical problems fitted with radio transmitters and released
8379326 theyre all doing great they all are still in good health george said
8379327 i dont think there will be any long term impact he added it was a stressful couple of days for them but they settled into our site pretty well and started to exhibit normal behavior pretty soon
8379328 we think the fire or the smoke overtook them the bodies were never recovered but its been long enough now that we presume they are dead
8379329 its encouraging to me how well the birds survived during the fire sorenson said
8379330 not only can they deal with fire when it is occurring but it gives us some foreshadowing that the condors can survive on their own when we are ready

8379408 we know that shes going to support him as a loyal democrat
8379409 what we dont know is if she thinks hes prepared to be commander in chief because she said he wasnt during the primary campaign and she said nothing last night to suggest the opposite
8379410 i dont think hes adequately explained why he passed over hillary clinton
8379411 i believe that the reason for the bounce mccain has received is deciding to not take hillary clinton and taking joe biden instead
8379412 not that joe biden is a bad choice but hillary clinton got the votes of 18 million democrats joe biden got the votes of 9 000 i think that might have a lot to do with it

8379420 we may be on the verge of a turning point in the battle against abortion
8379421 response to our call for communities to participate in this falls 40 days for life campaign has exceeded our wildest expectations
8379422 were especially pleased to see three canadian cities joining 40 days for life this fall
8379423 as there will also be a campaign in washington d c this means that 40 days for life will have a presence in the capitals of two nations we firmly believe that this campaign of prayer and fasting will have a profound impact
8379424 planned parenthood is a special concern because it is the nations largest abortion provider
8379425 the growth of this outreach is a reflection of the excitement that people are expressing about the many ways 40 days for life impacts a community this program is being embraced by cities conducting their first 40 days for life and those who are planning their second third or in the case of bryan college station texas fourth campaign
8379426 this indicates that growing economic prosperity and education levels have not led to a corresponding mitigation in this acute problem

8379431 the buffer law is breathtaking in its scope it obviously was designed and intended to squelch pro life speech but it prohibits much more such as labor picketing and charitable solicitations
8379432 the first amendment simply does not permit such outlandish restrictions on peaceful speech
8379433 other than political pandering there seems to be little cause for changing the law so that the constitutional right to free speech falls somewhere below the right of clinic workers and patients to come and go without being yelled at

8379498 yob is reforming to record a new album and do a limited number of shows we have a number of new songs we are working on and our goal is to record in the spring for a summer 2009 release we are very excited about this new material
8379499 yob will be doing a very small amount of shows to support our new recording
8379500 we recorded five songs and i sent the pressing out in a blank jacket with nothing more than the bands name and my home phone number on it
8379501 a phone call came from burbank california two days later it was alive records founder patrick boissel we really didnt expect to be making a record at the time when alive records called me back it came as a shock we were just looking to catch our bearings and the next thing you know i am telling someone yes we do have the rest of the material prepared go ahead and send us a check and we will finish the album it was a scramble to book additional studio time and do whatever the fuck we needed to do to finish that first record
8379502 dan didnt know we formed a new group until he heard the first buffalo killers record and realized it was us he called me wanting to know why i hadnt got in contact to tell him about it
8379503 it was just a thing where we started over and didnt want to approach audiences as a band rising out of the ashes of another
8379504 things started to happen for us when we went to l a in support of the first album
8379505 a drummer friend of mine came that night and told me that the black crowes had told him about the show i was kind of taken aback all i could think was chris robinson heard our record we were just going out to california to play some shows in support of the first record and we were fully under the impression no one was going to show up we thought we were going to make some rounds play to a few people and then upon returning we might have a cool thing going on
8379506 it was a big fucking deal to me when the black crowes asked us to go on the road with them i grew up listening to them for us it was like touring with the beatles
8379507 my brother and i grew up in a musical household because my dad played guitar we grew up listening to neil young the grateful dead csny and new riders of the purple sage from as long back as i can remember they along with my father taught us how to play music as a kid you think what does your father know but looking back if i wanted to hear something new all i had to do was go downstairs and rummage through his record collection it was all right there if we wanted to play an instrument the amps were already in the house we were groomed to do this
8379508 when we would go out on tour we would come home and it felt like every town in ohio embraced us there was no pressure like playing in new york for us
8379509 for us it is about the music we play not how we look playing here in cincinnati there was no pressure we could go fuck off and completely bomb here it really didnt matter we could always just start over the spotlight wasnt as bright as it might have been in new york though we were playing to our friends and family the people we grew up with and sometimes that might hold more pressure than playing to a bunch of strangers
8379510 i dont know if she was yelling a little bit or not
8379511 we know that the councilwoman is very passionate and shes not a pushover that we can say and when youre in that kind of situation that many people around shuffled from one room to another and someone comes up thats out of the loop and says youre going to be out of here i would imagine that you would be a little upset

8379586 the potential of shared capitalism to improve individual and organizational performance through financial incentives depends on employees knowing about and participating in compensation plans that link rewards to performance this paper therefore analyzes a survey of employees from multiple companies to assess the extent to which employees are ignorant about company group and individual based incentive pay plans and esops the findings reveal significant amounts of employee ignorance in both under and overstating the extent to which such plans apply to them individually
8379587 between one third and one half of employees participate directly in company performance through profit sharing gainsharing employee ownership or stock options this flies in the face of concerns about the free rider problem and worker risk aversion in group incentives and raises many questions about the effects on firms and workers this paper lays out the major reasons we may see such shared capitalism plans and reviews recent nationally representative surveys on the prevalence of these plans
8379588 this paper uses data from nber surveys of over 40 000 employees in hundreds of facilities in 14 firms and from employees on the 2002 and 2006 general social surveys to explore how shared compensation affects turnover absenteeism loyalty worker effort and other outcomes affecting workplace performance
8379589 we find that greater involvement in the programs is generally linked to greater participation in decisions higher quality supervision and treatment of employees more training higher pay and benefits greater job security and higher job satisfaction we also find positive interactions of shared capitalism with high performance policies in predicting participation in decisions and overall job satisfaction and negative interactions of shared capitalism with close supervision in affecting almost all of the outcomes overall the results support the idea that workers can gain by sharing but whether this happens is contingent on other workplace policies

8379606 the u s district court for the middle district of alabama rejected the attempt by an employee stock ownership plan esop participant to revive her fiduciary breach case based on the recent u s supreme court ruling that defined contribution plan participants can seek individual account damages in fiduciary breach suits
8379607 even though the larue case involved a drop in the value of a 401 k account the impact of the case can be significant in any context where a plan participant believes that by fiduciary action or inaction his or her individual benefits were negatively impacted this means that a participant may directly and immediately bring suit for breach of fiduciary duty without moving through the benefit claim and appeal process the presumption of correctness for fiduciary defendants and the requirement that plaintiffs prove that a benefit denial was arbitrary and capricious simply does not apply in a breach of fiduciary duty claim

8379730 in 2007 if we sold dry distillers grains at 84 or 85 percent of the price of corn we paid somewhere between 30 to 40 percent for the cost of drying we pay to dry it but then there is less feeding value
8379731 it does take more loads of wet than dry feeds
8379732 but we have tried to account for all of that at this time we would prefer to not have it dried at all the economics are favorable
8379733 we were trying to figure out whether it is the fat or protein that gives the feed its extra energy
8379734 it went down the feed value to slightly above almost equal to corn
8379735 the bottom line is that the feeding value would decrease but considering the value of the fat it still may be economical to do that however the feed will most likely be sold for less
8379736 we are pleased to bring our hartley ethanol biorefinery into production
8379737 we appreciate the support of our team business partners and the community of hartley to help make this day a reality
8379738 ethanol mandates have been a boondoggle raising the cost of food as well as fuel and causing environmental harm in the process
8379739 therefore the sierra club is calling on gov corzine to opt new jersey out of the federal ethanol mandate
8379740 he has environmental concerns over how the ethanol is produced and we are a state that has farming
8379741 we did extensive testing of the ethanol product quality and found that the most significant find was color change it turned a dark amber color
8379742 pipeline companies are all working for it but we need to work together to solve the biggest problem stress crack corrosion
8379743 we cant jeopardize the pipelines until we know exactly why it happens and how will affect the pipelines
8379744 we focus on where our customers want us to go and what they want us to do and thats why we are focusing on ethanol
8379745 as our customers look to meet the renewable fuels standard rfs quantity they will be looking at this and we will respond to that
8379746 in the gulf coast we have a 24 terminal system in 15 markets and our plan is to have all of those ethanol capable in 2009
8379747 there is a lot of preparation going on to get ready for that
8379748 tens of thousands of new parts have to be brought in and replaced valves pumps and the pipeline
8379749 its what we see in the future if youre blending it ahead of time then theres more interface you have to add more tankage and thats a higher expense
8379750 it took most of our staff in washington d c and we took it very seriously
8379751 one of the reasons we took the extra time was because of the huge amount of comments and also that it was the first time this has ever happened since the original mandate was enforced
8379752 we engaged early and often with stakeholders through the process
8379753 the main change was the volume but there were many new obligations and definitions
8379754 the most unique thing about this rule is the renewable fuels must now be produced from biomass
8379755 we will also be doing studies on how these biofuels affect our air quality as a result of these different blend level requirements
8379756 the requirement to operate on gasoline in todays flex fuel engines limits their thermal efficiency when operating on alcohol fuels
8379757 however the physical and chemical properties of alcohols when compared to gasoline provide the potential for higher thermal efficiency operation to be achieved this single cylinder research engine will investigate a highly thermal efficient combustion system that optimizes engine performance to fully exploit the properties of both gasoline and alcohol fuels and to maximize efficiency
8379758 the rsb remains committed to incorporating and recognizing other sustainability standards work and to harmonizing and reducing any eventual reporting burdens as much as possible
8379759 rins that come directly from the producers will now be certified by a third party registry rinstar and in turn the producers will see more value in their product
8379760 we are pleased to provide our biofuel producer customers an efficient straightforward process to manage rin compliance
8379761 by having the ability to communicate with the rinstar registry our customers can focus on their business and reduce effort to meet renewable fuels standard rfs reporting requirements

8379765 its a touchy subject but if i should be honest i really believe men get more attention in this sport
8379766 its based on the fact that the world record in the 100m and 200m for men is reachable
8379767 for me my prs personal records are 10 85 and 21 74 which i just accomplished here and i only ran that once it is hard for me to even think about the world record
8379768 it is beyond my reach the 200m world record is 21 34 and the 100m record is 10 49 how many females have even run 10 6 in the past 20 years since flo jo set that record
8379769 its disappointing to not get the respect that the males do because they are capable of breaking the record and people are excited to see them run because they know the possibility of breaking the record is close i dont have that luxury and a lot of my competitors dont have that luxury right now

8379775 gay is a good athlete and he would have pushed bolt hard
8379776 but i dont think he would have beaten him considering what bolt achieved with such an ease he was on a different planet altogether
8379777 i know bolt since the age of 15 and at first look it struck me he is one for the future he has the charisma to take athletics to a new level
8379778 its not easy for a junior to run 200 metres under 20 seconds but he managed to achieve this feat if not for injuries he would have blossomed a bit earlier but the time away has in fact helped him
8379779 he is a much better athlete now and is on his way to becoming one of the greatest
8379780 bolts arrival has given a fresh lease of life for athletics which has been under cloud since the doping revelation from some top athletes over the last few years

8379790 xcel energy voluntarily has reduced its carbon emissions by large amounts in recent years and plans to continue making significant reductions in co2 emissions in the future
8379791 we previously provided detailed information concerning the expected impact of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions regulations on our operations and under this agreement we will make even more detailed disclosures this agreement will enhance our already aggressive efforts to be responsible environmental stewards
8379792 xcel energy represents that it has voluntarily reduced its ghg greenhouse gas emissions by a cumulative total of over 18 million tons since 2003

8379805 it is my conviction that it is time barry allen returned i really think the way he died was noble and wonderful and everything but i miss the character i want to tell stories about him so does geoff people want to read him i think and if they dont think they do now well make them realize that they did
8379806 he is as important to dc comics in my opinion as superman for that very reason
8379807 and now more than ever its time to bring back barry allen because he is a csi scientist that is incredibly relevant geoff is going to have a blast telling stories with him pg 13 scary crime stories with a flash its a lot of fun
8379808 and the great thing about it is that hal jordan and barry allen were such great friends
8379809 to have both of them back together again could be the return of that classic buddy team comic like butch cassidy and the sundance kid i hope there is a sort of brave and the bold situation down the line with these two
8379810 the boots are awesome and i wish i had a pair because if i did id wear them
8379811 id be wearing them now but really the great thing about flashs costume is the number of hot areas on it i love the little bands around his arms that are red hot and the lightning bolt across his chest that makes his costume asymmetrical and that belt those are areas that other artists have drawn lightning to and made energy bounce across its a really smart simple and clever costume design i really enjoy drawing it no matter who is under the mask the flash costumes are always great
8379812 its always been a matter of finding a block of time to do it and then the right talent to help me with it
8379813 i dont dare write it myself i just want to have a creative hand in it to make sure it represents the vision i have for the character
8379814 i need a really really really good writer who wants to have an unlikely hit book
8379815 and the word is out how about darwyn cooke that would be cool darwyn is good at that mobster thing and geoff johns also said he would do it but geoff has a lot on his plate i really dont want to weigh him down with something else
8379816 and then after reading about 50 issues of police comics and plastic man comics i went to find out what had come next
8379817 what did they do to this character that i had really grown to love and appreciate
8379818 he and i do good stuff together he is my best collaborator and when he calls i will come running and create some cool comics with him

8379867 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8379868 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8379869 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8379870 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
