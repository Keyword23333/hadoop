3760000 the league is very tough kind of a gritty place to play
3760001 playing that level of college football is hard when i got there i got to see how aggressive i really was after playing the position for a while it became natural and i fell into it

3760005 day in the life of a d magazine art director
3760006 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3760007 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3760008 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3760009 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3760010 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3760011 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3760012 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3760013 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3760014 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3760015 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3760016 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3760017 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3760018 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process

3760025 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3760026 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3760027 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3760028 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3760029 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3760030 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3760031 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3760032 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3760033 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3760034 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3760035 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3760036 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3760037 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3760038 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3760039 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3760040 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3760041 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3760042 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3760043 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3760044 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3760045 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3760046 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3760047 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3760048 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3760049 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3760050 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3760051 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3760052 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3760053 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3760054 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3760055 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her

3760060 your training provides a variety of stimuli that lead to physiological adaptations and gives you the confidence that comes with achieving challenging training goals
3760061 training does not however completely prepare you to race there is an additional component to racing well that can only be gained by well racing
3760062 to prepare optimally for a goal race you need to do several tune up races
3760063 in a race you are competing against other runners and there is a fine margin between relative success and relative failure similarly in a race you are committed to finish or should be whether you are having a good day or a lousy day
3760064 in a workout however if things are not going well you can always stop early with your pride relatively intact the all out aspect of racing provides a physical challenge and mental hardening that is necessary to run up to your potential when you are at your limit in your goal race wondering whether you can hang on and there are still several miles to go it helps to have been through a similar situation in tune up races
3760065 your results in tune up races provide feedback on the effectiveness of your training program
3760066 the closer the distance of the tune up race to your goal race the better indication you will get of your fitness for your goal race
3760067 training through a tune up race provides an excellent training stimulus and provides the mental challenge necessary to prepare you for your goal race racing when tired however brings the danger of believing that your finishing time and place represents your current fitness level if you typically race 10 kilometers in 32 minutes and run 33 40 in a tune up race you could interpret the result that you are not in shape and start to train harder or just become discouraged it is important to step back and interpret your tune up race results within the context of your overall training plan
3760068 a three day taper will improve your performance in the tune up race without interfering substantially with your training
3760069 in preparing for a goal race at the shorter end of the road racing spectrum 5k to 10k you also may want to include a tune up race at the same distance as your goal race
3760070 you should plan on a minimum of two tune up races in preparation for a goal race the maximum number of tune up races depends on a variety of factors but experience indicates it should be in the range of 3 to 5 if you toe the starting line too many times there is a risk of becoming tired of racing before reaching your goal race racing every second week seems to be optimal for many runners this gives you eight good days of training two days recovery from previous race eight days training three day taper next race to advance your fitness between races
3760071 if you are devoting 16 weeks to preparing for a goal marathon for example you might do an eight week base training phase and have your first tune up race with eight weeks to go a good plan would be to race every second week until your goal race which would give you four tune up races as preparation for achieving your marathon goal

3760088 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3760089 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3760090 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children

3760119 greatly regrets that a technical failure has interfered with new zealanders appreciation of moss burmesters tremendous effort
3760120 all broadcasters undertaking technically complex transmissions run the risk of occasional switching failures but the company says everyone involved is distressed at the timing of the glitch
3760121 so was it just me or did the whole nation just miss out on watching moss burmester swimming in the 200m butterfly final thanks to some technical glitch at tvnz brilliant the most anticipated event in the olympics so far and we all got to watch a blank tv
3760122 so disapointing missing burmesters final tvnz we didnt get to see the most anticipated nz event so far ridiculous and what a joke
3760123 i was one of the lucky ones to see the whole race live
3760124 tvnz you should be bloody embarrassed with what happened today just before moss burmesters final it just shows how incompetent the state broadcaster really is sack them all
3760125 tvnzs coverage has ranged from poor to embarrassing ad breaks in between finals that last only 57 seconds the loss of moss burmesters race and a tvnz reporter asking olympic gold medallist world record holder natalie coughlin about michael phelps straight after becoming the first woman in olympic history to defend her olympic title in swimming the sooner sky gets the coverage the better
3760126 so tvnz manages to balls up the coverage of moss burmesters race for a big part of the country leaving us to wait for the replay 45 minutes later not good enough im somebody else that was also beginning to enjoy the womans road race toward the end and was very disappointed tvnz never cut back for updates or even told us who won bring on london 2012 with coverage by sky sport im sick and tired of the substandard job from tvnz
3760127 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
3760128 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
3760129 our estimate assumes each of the 2 200 at amp t stores will sell an average of 5 phones per day from the july 11th launch through the end of the september quarter
3760130 we believe that our revision may be conservative and that apple will meet our estimates
3760131 the august 22nd launch in additional countries should provide another catalyst to sales

3760144 you dont ever use the word never happen its not healthy
3760145 i do not think its heading to a new trial
3760146 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3760147 i believe that there are others in prison like me and then there are others in prison who are guilty youve got to give it a chance to work
3760148 everybodys concerned about the price of oil and ways to afford it its just mind boggling because last year our typical price was 2 50 a gallon and now its almost doubled
3760149 its really scary this is really going to devastate the middle class in ways were just understanding
3760150 i could easily see that 25 or 30 heating oil retailers would not be able to make it through the next heating season without any question
3760151 theres a sense of real confusion as well as anxiety and apprehension about whether people are going to be able to heat their homes and who to trust to give them advice let alone deliver the product

3760162 we are basically seeing the cold blooded preplanned premeditated murder of a small country
3760163 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3760164 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3760165 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3760166 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportionate and continuing military attacks by russia appear to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3760167 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3760168 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3760169 they solve their symptoms they make them feel good and they essentially want to stay on them forever because once they go off them acid reflux returns
3760170 there may be patients who have very mild symptoms of heartburn who while they get relief from these medications may find they get equally good relief with less aggressive medications
3760171 i get the pains in my bones i can feel the bone pain
3760172 i think the first thing we need to do is stop the medicine altogether

3760185 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing
3760186 its hard to criticise them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here but if they dont make the side they will be kicking themselves
3760187 i think nicks going to pick ian if he has to because of his second place at the open and if paul casey is playing decently you would definitely pick him id be surprised if nick went for monty though from what ive heard wild cards go to players in form and told me that the last thing you want is to go to a ryder cup playing badly

3760204 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3760205 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3760206 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3760207 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3760208 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3760209 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3760210 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3760211 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3760212 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3760213 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3760214 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3760215 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3760216 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3760217 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3760218 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3760219 it will affect every driving under the influence of drugs case pending in nassau county
3760220 if the judge in these few cases agreed with the higher court then the labs location wouldnt have any legal significance

3760234 be a yardstick of quality some people arent used to an environment where excellence is expected
3760235 best of breed is dead unless you are at a dog show
3760236 then look for items made out of recycled content like cotton hemp bamboo and cork and try to stay away from plastics you can get substitutes for all kinds of items like hangers and rugs
3760237 go more organic for bedding and towels like 100 percent cotton they cost more and dont always come in the extra long twin for dorm rooms but you can opt for an organic pillow at least
3760238 you dont have to bring a microwave and refrigerator as these are usually available in the common area so are tvs and dvd players
3760239 its all about using less energy and if you do have your own appliances keep them on power save mode
3760240 its not always easy for a college student to afford eco friendly items and its hard to find them even if they are affordable so i do what i can
3760241 its really a matter of changing habits in ways that dont cost much for instance i use as little water as possible when taking a shower or washing dishes i never buy plastic water bottles and instead have a reusable aluminum bottle and fill it with tap water i have reusable canvas bags for shopping and i try to rely on my bike for transportation
3760242 the less packaging the better so we reduce the amount of plastics being used and trash
3760243 its really about a student lifestyle change and habits that can be a challenge at first but ultimately arent difficult to adopt

3760253 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure that you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligations of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3760254 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3760255 a private burial service for our children ben and catherine was held earlier today
3760256 it was our wish that the burial was held in private and we thank the media for respecting our privacy
3760257 we are currently making plans together for a funeral service which will allow extended family members friends and colleagues of ben and catherine to pay their respects
3760258 it is the families intention for the media to be facilitated at this service details of which will be confirmed in due course
3760259 in the meantime the media are asked to continue to respect our wishes to be able to grieve in private and to try and come to terms with the terrible events of the past few weeks

3760263 er zijn zo weinig vrouwen die een technologiebedrijf leiden dat bij een vertrek onmiddellijk gewezen wordt op een gebrek aan vrouwelijk leiderschap in de sector
3760264 maar nog bemoedigender is de opkomst van talloze jonge vrouwelijke professionals die hun weg naar de top aan het maken zijn
3760265 van het overgrote gedeelte daarvan heeft men nog nooit gehoord maar ze zijn er wel zoals tina sharkey johnson amp johnson caterina fake flickr en mena trott six apart gina bianchini ning en zelfs marissa mayer onderdirecteur search products amp user exeperience bij google
3760266 maar ze zijn ook niet beschaamd om hun vrouwelijke kant te tonen het zijn allemaal moderne en hippe moeders met jonge kinderen maar ze sluiten hun persoonlijk leven niet af bij een demonstratie van sociale netwerken gebruikte gina bianchini zelfs haar eigen netwerk waarmee vrienden haar konden helpen om haar huwelijk te plannen zou iemand van de oude garde in silicon valley een dergelijke persoonlijke toets hebben aangebracht

3760282 there has been a man arrested for burglary this morning at an address in shieldfield
3760283 that man is currently detained at pilgrim street police station he was not arrested in connection with the murder investigation
3760284 officers from the major investigation team are looking into the circumstances of that burglary and his arrest
3760285 at this stage there is no evidence to link it to the murder but you never say never in this business
3760286 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions

3760291 tatyana invited the students to express their own opinions as they discussed this interpretation she assumed her students knew the material and invited them to use their knowledge in search of deeper understandings nor was i surprised that i had been invited to observe
3760292 children learn to learn together from the first year of school i was na ve to think that the students would take the initiative to discover their own solution to the giant conflict that was not the soviet way it is a given that all soviet children struggle for peace period open ended approaches are an anathema to soviet education alternatives choices speculation unresolved outcomes these do not fit a prescribed curriculum particularly a national curriculum one that has been designed and produced at the ministry of education in at home my american students insist upon creating unique responses soviet students on the other hand seek to discover what is the right response

3760311 transtow have come up with an idea that means a double seat retracts to make room for the wheelchair
3760312 the bases of two seats flip up allowing a hatch to be opened while the retract a seat folds backwards into a compartment below the floor the hatch is then lowered and locked into position to create a surface on which to park the wheelchair
3760313 the design works in partnership with a wheelchair lift al lowing the user to enter through a separate side door the whole process takes just one minute and can be operated by one member of staff
3760314 it the design would not have been possible without input from translink and wrightbus and in particular the help and assistance provided by staff in the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering at queens

3760319 well just throw me into the sea for i know that this is because of me
3760320 i give our players the ones that i inherited a lot of credit they bought in instantly to what we were doing it didnt take much persuasion by me or our coaching staff
3760321 he came back really strong once he started throwing when they first cleared him we ran about 60 routes and he was on the money on all of them
3760322 hes a talented kid he catches the ball well out of the backfield hes big and strong so hes durable but we need more than one we need ryan houston and jamal womble to step up
3760323 marvin is a delight to coach because he just loves football he has a burning passion to be good
3760324 i think last year we should have stopped the run a lot better but we were young and didnt understand our responsibilities we gave up too many big running plays because of missed assignments

3760357 women get involved for many reasons perhaps they like the social aspect or they want to lose weight or maybe they think it will help their mental health and lift their mood
3760358 whatever it is wispa is all about giving women the confidence to be able to look after their physical health for themselves its a holistic approach
3760359 we need a game plan for bringing parking technology into the 21st century in all five boroughs
3760360 muni meters and pay by phone systems increase parking availability and allow drivers to pay by credit cards so that people dont have to keep their piggy banks in their glove compartments
3760361 muni meters provide for more parking spaces than do parking meters
3760362 as everyone knows parking spaces are in demand i am also enthusiastic about this bill because it provides for an additional innovative way to purchase a muni meter ticket use your cell phone as payment system congratulations to council member felder

3760369 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3760370 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3760371 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3760372 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3760373 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3760374 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3760375 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3760376 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3760377 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3760378 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3760379 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3760380 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3760381 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3760382 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3760383 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3760384 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3760385 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3760386 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3760387 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will
3760388 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3760389 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3760390 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3760391 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
3760392 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
3760393 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3760394 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3760395 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3760396 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3760397 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3760398 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3760399 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3760400 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3760401 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3760402 it was a joint decision to achieve the most theatrical effects

3760407 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way

3760409 has appropriately raised serious concerns about the safety of prescribing over the internet
3760410 outperformed the traditional system in most of the safety variables tested
3760411 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study
3760412 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
3760413 just having a green roof may not mean anything in terms of preventing water from reaching the street level for instance
3760414 green roofs have to be done right and our hope is to help manufacturers understand how to improve their designs
3760415 thats a huge difference to have a 20 or so degree temperature drop
3760416 after you choose a manufacturer tell them what kind of plants and what other features you want
3760417 its up to them to then tailor the green roof to your needs
3760418 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3760419 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3760420 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3760421 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
3760422 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3760423 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
3760424 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
3760425 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3760426 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3760427 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes

3760432 we remain focused on our commitment to innovation in the field of biomedicines to addressing the ongoing needs of patients living with these debilitating diseases and to physicians in need of additional therapeutic options to effectively treat their patients

3760434 sexual dysfunction among older adults prevalence and risk factors from a nationally representative u s probability sample of men and women 57 to 85 years of age
3760435 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
3760436 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3760437 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3760438 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming

3760446 it started raining at about a quarter to six and when youre in a tent its even worse it does affect your mood
3760447 when you start analyzing it its not just the weather but the weather certainly played a part
3760448 people expect this time of year to have nice sunny weather
3760449 they can go on vacation they can relax and when that expectation isnt met the body is going to have a stress reaction
3760450 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now

3760453 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3760454 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3760455 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3760456 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch

3760458 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
3760459 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3760460 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3760461 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks

3760481 looking ahead we expect retail activity to remain fairly subdued as consumers continue to consolidate their financial position and with consumers accounting for over 70 per cent of u s economic activity the expected slowdown in spending will likely limit the extent of any economic recovery in the near to medium term
3760482 on the face of it this mornings report looks strong with only car sales down but this can easily be misleading excluding gasoline and food where inflation is the highest right now retail sales are down for two months in a row and are declining 0 6 per cent on a year over year basis in the second quarter core retail sales were up by 9 per cent but real spending was only a fraction of it because of price effects based on july data the effect of the tax refund is fading since retail sales are slowing down from the second quarter all in all job creation remains sluggish and domestic demand is fragile imports were down in yesterdays trade report there is a weaker trajectory for the economy entering the third quarter
3760483 the component of sales that feeds into real consumer spending ex autos gas and building materials rose 0 3 per cent in july together with the steep drop in autos in the month this suggests that real spending likely dipped slightly in july and will struggle to post any growth at all for q3 the good news is that the lower oil prices will take some of the intense burden off households the bad news is the rebates are over and employment continues to weaken
3760484 despite signs of lingering consumer strength in july once one excludes autos there is no doubt that this result along with the results of the previous three months were bolstered by over 100 billion in government stimulus payments the only problem is that this government support ran dry in the middle of the month and therefore the outlook for august and the third quarter as a whole is decidedly negative

3760507 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3760508 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3760622 can democrats do more than exploit bushs foreign policy blunders to gain a tactical electoral edge can they take advantage of the increased public confidence in their judgment to advance a distinct twenty first century foreign policy that voters will prefer and trust them to execute
3760623 unfortunately the democrats have too often failed to contest such dangerous conservative fantasies
3760624 has mostly been to play charlie brown perennially falling down as lucy yanks away the football swearing not to be fooled again
3760625 have tended to approach security debates from a reflexive posture of fear preemptively assuming a defensive crouch from which it is impossible to practice politics effectively
3760626 yglesias is most convincing when he discusses the other two factors behind the rush to war an international security hawkishness among democrats who accepted kenneth pollacks argument that iraq was indeed a
3760627 yglesias shows how for the last five years democrats have allowed themselves to be hemmed in by the conservative mind set about iraq arguing over tactics such as whether international support could be acquired whether enough troops had been sent or whether the surge has caused a drop in violence
3760628 conservative republicans have not merely made some mistakes on iraq and some other mistakes on iran and some other mistakes on north korea plus some mistakes on syria while mishandling the israeli palestinian conflict and by coincidence damaging our relationships with formerly close allies
3760629 in 2002 and 2003 the new republic was one of the leading crusaders for an attack on iraq railing against what it called
3760630 i dont think you can argue that a regime change in iraq wont demonstrably and almost immediately improve the living conditions of the iraqi people
3760631 if our strategic rationale for war has collapsed our moral one has not
3760632 the new republic deeply regrets its early support for this war
3760633 also in 2004 the new republic endorsed joe lieberman for the democratic nomination for president using its endorsement to attack howard dean and his liberal supporters as suffering from
3760634 dangerously out of touch with a country that feels threatened by terrorism not donald rumsfeld
3760635 dean has helped create this mood of self righteous delusion and his competitors have to varying degrees accommodated themselves to it
3760636 in 2006 tnrs chait denounced those who were trying to defeat lieberman in the democratic primary as
3760637 exactly the sorts of fanatics who tore the party apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s
3760638 theres hardly any sense in which lieberman is an independent figure
3760639 by any metric that is a humiliating track record more importantly its a perfect museum exhibit to illustrate how the democratic party failed completely to provide any meaningful opposition to the extremism excesses and abuses of the bush years instead enabling and endorsing those abuses when they werent standing by meekly and quietly allowing it all to take root throughout the bush era the democratic party has been dominated by the new republic syndrome democrats who are either petrified of meaningfully opposing the right wing agenda that has dominated our country or who support virtually all of it while eagerly volunteering to serve as the most vocal demonizers of those who want our country to have a real opposition party
3760640 the democrats had such a smashing victory in 2006 because for the first time in a long time and really despite themselves there was a perception rightly or wrongly that they actually stood for something different than the gop in national security an end to the war in iraq
3760641 the most distinctive and potent one could even say exciting aspect of obamas campaign had been his aggressive refusal to accept gop pieties on national security his insistence that the gop would lose and should lose debates over who is
3760642 the advice hes getting and apparently beginning to follow is now the opposite that he should shed his prior beliefs in favor of the amorphous fuzzy conventional gop leaning center that he should cease to insist on a re examination of national security premises and instead live within the gop framework
3760643 vpirg was in the room when those things were considered and i think they understand why the legislature didnt enact the recommendations in their report
3760644 we think there are myths out there keeping people from finding out whether they are eligible for the program
3760645 over 10 000 vermonters have insurance who didnt have it when we started last october we think thats significant enrollment we think thats a significant inroad into the 60 000 uninsured vermonters
3760646 the economic climate has business owners feeling the brunt of rising health care costs

3760657 he was tracing the veins and had about 15 leaves done
3760658 he had a box of glitter and a thing of elmers glue
3760659 i have had the phone for a couple of weeks and i havent had any dropped calls until a couple of days ago now at least 50 of my call get dropped or i get a call failed message when trying to make a call even though i have a strong signal on 3g
3760660 the phone will also bounce from 3g to edge to no service and then back to 3g the phone works fine if i turn off 3g but that defeats the purpose of having a 3g iphone
3760661 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users
3760662 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3760663 the radio signal weakens and the immaturity of the stack really shows
3760664 this device is working great on our 3g network we are thrilled with the customer interest in it
3760665 are you in buildings are there tall trees are you in a mountainous area wireless networks are shared resources the traffic has to be managed

3760730 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3760731 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3760732 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3760886 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3760887 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3760888 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3760889 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3760890 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3760891 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year

3760904 no s nada me lo acaba de comunicar el jefe de prensa pero mi pensamiento no pasa por ir a zaragoza estoy muy bien aqu y no tengo pensado marcharme
3760905 mientras no se cierre el plazo es normal que pase esto sin embargo una vez cerrado es absurdo dar continuidad a estos rumores la pasada temporada se habl demasiado pronto y nos afect luis garc a se est entrenando al m ximo compitiendo muy bien y su comportamiento es de diez
3760906 en mi caso puedo sacar partido a la experiencia y no tengo problema en asumir ese rol que por otra parte quiz es el que me toca ahora
3760907 while the amount of damages is certainly significant more importantly our goal was to put a stop to this operations dealings in counterfeit symantec software and to protect any unsuspecting users from using fraudulent security software
3760908 we were also able to secure all information from this business regarding their production and distribution process and intend to use that information to press the case against others involved

3760914 losses continue to be incurred while government is denied tax revenue and shareholders are denied dividends we are not happy with the performance of public enterprises efficiency is still lacking and their performance is appalling
3760915 a major function of corporate governance is monitoring and reviewing organizational performance national commission for privatization should design performance contracts with chairmen of boards of public enterprises
3760916 corporate governance ensures that we adopt best practices in the management of public enterprises

3760920 we have needed such an establishment in kuisebmond this will assist the police a lot in its efforts to keep erongo safe i am sure that with the assistance of the neighbourhood watch of kuisebmond the police work in rooting out criminals in the erongo region will be fully complemented
3760921 crime affects us all we should not sit back and wait for others to do things for us we owe it upon ourselves and the community of kuisebmond to get up and join the fight
3760922 we need every form of assistance we can get to curb crime
3760923 i think we are now ready to start this job crime is really getting out of hand here and we cannot afford to simply sit back and leave everything in the hands of the police they need us and we are now ready to assist them
3760924 i am very happy about the result we obtained with summer session it is a fun game with hilarious dialogue and intriguing characters and very replayable thanks to the multiple endings

3760928 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3760929 the manager has made some great signings i never realised before how good deco really is
3760930 i played against him four or five times in the past and hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
3760931 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
3760932 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realise how determined he is
3760933 things havent gone too well for him over the last couple of years and he wants to prove himself theres no better place to do that than at chelsea
3760934 bosingwa looks good too he likes to get crosses into the box and you will see more attacking football from us this season
3760935 our strength in depth could be the key this season
3760936 the new boss is very relaxed he enjoys the banter and a laugh off the pitch but when you get on the pitch he wants things done properly
3760937 hes definitely got that fear factor you dont want to go too far or upset him
3760938 he has got the respect of the whole team because of what he has achieved in football
3760939 but when it comes down to it hes a really nice man with good people around him
3760940 the manager is a very experienced man and we spoke about alex fergusons experience
3760941 i dont know the managers gameplan but im sure he has a few tricks up his sleeve for along the way
3760942 hes a quiet man and maybe doesnt want to get involved in that mind games
3760943 hopefully we can stop him getting involved by taking an early lead in the premier league and leading the way

3760977 look at it from an unbiased point of view what would convince you that god exists i personally followed a logical path to atheism but being convinced of my reasons does not empower me to dismiss faith altogether
3760978 similarly it would seem to me that dinesh is making the point that science is not presently at liberty to define in precise terms what makes us
3760979 perhaps there is a higher power it may not be rational to believe it since there is no evidentiary documentation or incident or phenomenon to support it but there is scant evidence against as well
3760980 give him a break give yourself a break logic can run both ways a true believer in logic cannot and will not dismiss without evidence something he can neither prove nor disprove just my two cents
3760981 well some very specific things prophecies maybe god making a personal appearance before thousands of people complete with answers to questions would be quite convincing just like the planet with yahweh made it that would be very powerful but not completely convincing i would love to believe in a god but sadly for me wishing does not really make it true
3760982 now it is such a bizarrely improbably coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful the babel fish could have evolved by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non existence of god
3760983 for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
3760984 the babel fish is a dead giveaway isnt it it could not have evolved by chance it proves you exist and so therefore by your own arguments you dont qed
3760985 so perhaps if such proof did exist god would be shall we say superfluous to requirements so heres my take if god doesnt exist there will be no proof of existence if he she does it is in her his favour not to prove this existence being omnipotent and omniscient i assume the maker would grasp this subtle point and refrain from extraordinary displays

3760987 pero antes que se acostasen rodearon la casa los hombres de la ciudad los varones de sodoma todo el pueblo junto desde el m s joven hasta el m s viejo y llamaron a lot y le dijeron d nde est n los varones que vinieron a ti esta noche s calos para que los conozcamos entonces lot sali a ellos a la puerta y cerr la puerta tras s y dijo os ruego hermanos m os que no hag is tal maldad
3760988 pero cuando estaban gozosos he aqu que los hombres de aquella ciudad hombres perversos rodearon la casa golpeando a la puerta y hablaron al anciano due o de la casa diciendo saca al hombre que ha entrado en tu casa para que lo conozcamos y sali a ellos el due o de la casa y les dijo no hermanos m os os ruego que no comet is este mal ya que este hombre ha entrado en mi casa no hag is esta maldad
3760989 no te echar s con var n como con mujer es abominaci n
3760990 si alguno se ayuntare con var n como con mujer abominaci n hicieron ambos han de ser muertos sobre ellos ser su sangre
3760991 por eso dios los ha dejado hacer lo que quieran y sus malos pensamientos los han llevado a hacer con sus cuerpos cosas vergonzosas en vez de adorar al dios verdadero adoran dioses falsos adoran las cosas que dios ha creado en vez de adorar al dios que las cre y que merece ser adorado por siempre am n por esa raz n dios ha dejado que esa gente haga todo lo malo que quiera por ejemplo entre ellos hay mujeres que no quieren tener relaciones sexuales con los hombres sino con otras mujeres y tambi n hay hombres que se comportan as pues no volvieron a tener relaciones sexuales con sus mujeres y se dejaron dominar por sus deseos de tener relaciones con otros hombres de este modo hicieron cosas vergonzosas los unos con los otros y ahora sufren en carne propia el castigo que se buscaron como no han querido tener en cuenta a dios dios los ha dejado hacer todo lo malo que su in til mente los lleva hacer son gente injusta malvada y codiciosa son envidiosos asesinos peleoneros tramposos y chismosos hablan mal de los dem s odian a dios son insolentes y orgullosos y se creen muy importantes siempre est n inventando nuevas maneras de hacer el mal y no obedecen a sus padres no quieren entender la verdad ni se puede confiar en ellos no aman a nadie ni se compadecen de nadie saben que dios ha dicho que quienes hacen esto merecen la muerte pero no s lo siguen haci ndolo sino que felicitan a quienes tambi n lo hacen
3760992 no sab is que los injustos no heredar n el reino de dios no os enga is ni los fornicarios ni los id latras ni los ad lteros ni los afeminados ni los homosexuales ni los ladrones ni los avaros ni los borrachos ni los maldicientes ni los estafadores heredar n el reino de dios
3760993 ay de los que a lo malo dicen bueno y a lo bueno malo que hacen de la luz tinieblas y de las tinieblas luz que ponen lo amargo por dulce y lo dulce por amargo ay de los sabios en sus propios ojos y de los que son prudentes delante de s mismos
3760994 ive had without question of doubt the busiest summer ive ever had in football and that goes for everyone in the club
3760995 we had a plan in place to refurbish the stadium and we were going to do one stand per summer but as a result of being promoted we decided we wouldnt be presenting ourselves in the best possible light if our stadium didnt look brand spanking new
3760996 were going into the premier league and because of the media interest and corporate interest there was a degree of work that we wanted to and we wanted to do it now
3760997 in addition to all that work weve put a new sound system in a new turnstile monitoring system and have new cctv all around the stadium
3760998 weve laid a completely new pitch are putting in a new red running track around the perimeter and have put segregation in the away end to accommodate more home fans than we could before were also in the process of refurbishing every single executive box and lounge so the clock is ticking
3760999 im not a fan of developing the corners just yet we are going to extend the car park next summer though wed also love to have put in the subway but its beyond our control but i sincerely hope it will be done by next summer
3761000 were all football fans and were in this position of being able to implement changes for the better whether it be a park and ride five miles away or the burger and chips you buy in the concourse
3761001 on top of the work weve chosen to do there is also certain work that we are required to do as a result of the premier league handbook
3761002 new media suites are something we had to do we had to extend the tv gantry we had to provide more seats in the press box and we had to enable every journalist who comes to a game to be able to see a tv monitor
3761003 they are all pieces of work we had to do as a result of the rules
3761004 the recent shooting of 80 dogs at two berks county kennels is saddening
3761005 the two kennels involved have both voluntarily closed but until our states outdated dog law is changed kennel owners may continue to kill their dogs for any reason they see fit even if it is simply to save money
3761006 house bill 2525 introduced in may would allow only veterinarians to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels the bill would strengthen current dog laws and provide better standards for the health and safety of dogs in commercial breeding kennels without burdening other types of kennels that house dogs the legislature has an opportunity to pass this important legislation this fall and they should as doing so will assure that this activity will be illegal in pa commercial breeding kennels moving forward
3761007 i mentioned that anthony perhaps second only to coach george karl is a popular target of criticism for the nuggets failure to get out of the first round of the playoffs in any of his five pro seasons particularly because his 2003 draft classmates dwyane wade and lebron james have both been to the nba finals already
3761008 my belief is its about players and about teammates and who youve got on your team
3761009 obviously the west is much more difficult top to bottom than the east
3761010 but carmelo won a national championship so he can win
3761011 dwyane wade was spectacular once again tuesday in the united states 97 76 victory over angola he finished with 19 points on 6 for 8 shooting from the field defended aggressively and created plays for his teammates but no matter what you see from wade in these olympics remember there is only meaningful health checkpoint for him the end of the season with all due respect to wades return to form hes missed 31 games each of the last two seasons and missed 21 games in his rookie season hes missed almost 25 percent of his regular season games 95 of 410 in five years
3761012 frankly after two games im not seeing anything like that from the nbas reigning mvp olympic kobe is playing like its the paul pierce wheelchairity invitational or whatever crappy all star exhibitions that nba ballers do in the summer so far hes shooting an atrocious 1 15 from beyond the arc against angola and china and instead of driving the lane and establishing some sort of offensive rhythm with a few easy hoops kobe simply passed off many uncontested layups and dunks plus his defense has been worse
3761013 in case you havent heard lebron told reporters that he would consider a 50 million offer to play for a european team
3761014 after vegas was the espys yall know i think im the best dressed on our team so it was just another opportunity for me to get fly me and my girl went out there and had a really good time we ate good partied and hung out with the rest of the team and their families the show was real nice too i hadnt ever been to an award show before so it was a good experience it was even better because we won after the espys i came back to louisville i finished up my camps golfed and of course skated my golf game has actually improved i think im kind of good now ive been going pretty regularly to play and im a lot better than i was last year im killing all my homies that i usually go golfing with other than golfing the only thing that ive been doing is skating yall know i love to skate the whole summer ive been going skating every friday and sunday when im in town skating is a way for me to relax i go and just be in my own world
3761015 team chairman clay bennett has recently said the number of fans whove signed up for the ticket request list is approaching 18 000 hes said the team will not sell out the building with season tickets but rather leave plenty of single season tickets available and enough for ample mini plans and group sales also the team has repeatedly said more than the league mandated 500 10 seats will be available although the organization has said ticket prices will be higher im told the number of 10 seats will be more than 3 000 that certainly should help out a lot of folks
3761016 his knee wasnt an issue and doesnt seem that it will be an issue
3761017 their guards are the key former houston rocket vasilis spanoulis scored 23 points against germany and excels at driving to the basket off the pick and roll a play that killed the u s in the loss two years ago theodoros papaloukas is a clever 6 foot 7 inch point guard who will be kobes toughest defensive test thus far while dimitris diamantidis is an elite defender who can shift between either guard slot defense is greeces other major strength they like to slow the game down and play a physical half court style so it will be up to the u s to try to pick up the tempo tomorrow theres little doubt that theyll pack in the defense and try to make the u s beat them from outside and if kobe and kidd are as bad at doing that as they were in the first two games greece just might succeed
3761018 gareth bale has signed a new contract that will see him commit his future to the club until 2012
3761019 common standards need to be implemented to make different information sources and databases compatible for and usable by the european digital library
3761020 his great plea for toleration is based on the impossibility of erecting theology into a demonstrable science it is impossible all should be of one mind and what is impossible to be done is not necessary it should be done differences of opinion there must be but heresy is not an error of the understanding but an error of the will he would submit all minor questions to the reason of the individual member but he set certain limits to toleration excluding whatsoever is against the foundation of faith or contrary to good life and the laws of obedience or destructive to human society and the public and just interests of bodies politic peace he thought might be made if men would not call all opinions by the name of religion and superstructures by the name of fundamental articles of the propositions of sectarian theologians he said that confidence was the first and the second and the third part

3761077 going to andronicos makes me feel like its 1986 and im at my pompous uncles house at dartmouth eating goat cheese for the first time ive had a lot of goat cheese since then andronicos just because you carry lots of goat cheese doesnt make you special at all
3761078 this trendy cafe is hidden in a super industrial neighborhood without the typical hustle bustle in the city
3761079 out with the russian army from georgia and from our country
3761080 georgians are undergoing through very difficult moments and it is our moral duty to show that we are with them and moreover that cdpp and the united democratic movement led by mikhail saakashvili belong to the same european political family the european peoples party
3761081 we cant stay and look indifferently on how the russian army of occupation murders our georgian brothers just because georgia as well as moldova wants to join the free and democratic countries and to reestablish its constitutional order on its internationally recognized territory we ask all the democratic countries to be close to the georgian people and to determine russia to give up the aggression and to withdraw its army from the territory of georgia god protect our georgian brothers

3761121 i find it quite amusing that so many people think that there exists a list of people to be removed from this list somewhere and that sending mail to everybody else in this list will somehow get their name added to said list and getting their name added to said list will make it so they stop receiving all these emails there must be some explanation for such behavior has this strategy worked for them in the past is there a psychological trick that makes people think this will work if there is anybody out there who studies organizational behavior i humbly suggest a study of this phenomenon

3761134 we collected about 7 900 tons of solid waste per year we estimate that by going to this program solid waste will be reduced by 50 percent
3761135 microsoft has eliminated over 109 tons of polystyrene that would have been burned as fuel
3761136 microsoft s newfound demand for the eco friendly cups plates and cutlery solidified an emerging market giving a boost to the compostable tableware industry in the process
3761137 were causing a huge demand for products in the compostable cutlery industry as well as the paper cup industry with the case of the cutlery what we ve found is that we actually doubled the market
3761138 it ll get you through a meal but by design it s supposed to fall apart shortly after that also make sure you don t leave a cup full of coffee on your desk if you do you might find a mess when you get to work the next day

3761142 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

3761147 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3761148 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3761149 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3761150 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

3761177 vista is the equivalent at a minimum of windows version 12
3761178 a monolithic operating system like windows perpetuates an obsolete design
3761179 the company should take heart from apple s willingness to brave the wrath of its users when in 2001 it introduced mac os x it was based on a modern microkernel design which runs a very small set of essential services that make the system less vulnerable to crashes
3761180 doesnt he realize that we did exactly that we switched from the old patched together os to the newer modern one and dealt with compatibility issues and people had to buy new versions of their apps to make them run faster and all that stuff and we did it in 2001 also
3761181 mac os x is architected in a fundamentally different or better way than windows
3761182 what would a software platform look like if it was designed from scratch with the primary goal of dependability
3761183 we could make a version of todays windows that was free of security vulnerabilities
3761184 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3761185 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3761186 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3761187 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3761188 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that

3761196 todays accident is an example and was waiting to happen
3761197 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3761198 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3761199 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3761200 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3761201 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3761202 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3761203 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3761204 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3761205 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3761206 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3761207 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3761208 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3761209 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3761210 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3761211 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city

3761237 creo que es una falacia buscar buenos mecanismos de subsidios a lo que tiene que apuntar el gobierno es a quitar ciertos combustibles del esquema de subsidios

3761247 el desfiladero de kodori abjasia fue bombardeado por aviones rusos pido una investigaci n internacional para establecer de qui n son esas bombas para que no nos acusen a nosotros
3761248 tropas de ocupaci n deben ser retiradas y sustituidas por fuerzas internacionales de paz

3761250 mosc es parte del conflicto y no puede por tanto cumplir la misi n pacificadora
3761251 lets see i need to do this and then rewind time and then the ghost of my character will do this while im doing something else but this element is time resistant so it will stay here
3761252 nice girls dont get the corner office unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers
3761253 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3761254 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3761255 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3761256 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3761257 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3761258 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3761259 guys were i wouldnt say shocked but it was kind of a situation where it happened rather quickly it was a special moment in a lot of ways you could feel the outpouring for those guys when they came to say their goodbyes it was genuine feelings
3761260 these guys they knew they had to come together we were two players short tonight you could feel the intensity and the focus and unfortunately we lost but this team is a special bunch
3761261 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3761262 if your white blood cell count it high you will have to go to the er
3761263 your white blood cell count is really high and you are very dehydrated you need to go to the er immediately
3761264 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on the rock
3761265 but what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart and this defiles a man
3761266 for from the heart come evil thoughts murders adulteries sexual immoralities thefts false testimonies blasphemies
3761267 enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction and there are many who go through it
3761268 i say then walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh for the flesh desires what is against the spirit and the spirit desires what is against the flesh these are opposed to each other so that you dontt do what you want
3761269 there is a way that seems right to a man but its end is the way to death
3761270 but seek fist the kingdom of god and his righteouseness and these things will be provided for you
3761271 if then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who ask him
3761272 changes my commute time from 1 hours to 50 minutes
3761273 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3761274 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3761275 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3761276 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3761277 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3761278 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3761279 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3761280 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3761281 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3761282 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3761283 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3761284 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3761285 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3761286 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3761287 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3761288 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3761289 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3761290 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3761291 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3761292 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3761293 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3761294 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3761295 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3761296 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3761309 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3761310 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3761311 all of the sudden starbucks experience felt different my drink tasted different the romance of my morning coffee was gone of course chemically my drink had the same composition often however the milk tasted burnt a by product of preheating milk that has to stay warm longer while it waits for a customer if you remove the romance starbucks reverts to selling a simple easily substitutable commodity after a few mornings of unromantic experiences i wondered why i was forking out money for a latte that tasted so blah and i stopped going it took a few years but ive recently found a great little coffee shop that makes the best lattes in town the company offer fresh hand measured and timed espresso shots individually heated milk regardless of how many customers are in line and fancy designs on their lattes they offer the romance i was missing money and speed never played a factor in my decision starbucks fails to understand that as evidence i submit a recent ad campaign the promise better coffee faster the company is now openly admitting they are selling a commodity in the place of romance they are offering operational excellence starbucks only thinks they sell better coffee true coffee lovers the ones that can tell you where the beans are from just by sipping the coffee avoid the company
3761312 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3761313 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3761315 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3761316 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3761317 el es un chico de buena coraz n y es realmente apasionado en lo que hace
3761318 the ulster unionist party of abandoning this valued and much loved part of our community as they rush to embrace an anti orange agenda
3761319 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
3761320 judging by its most recent ill tempered statement the dup press office appears to be having a bad few days the accusation that the uup is engaged in a diatribe against other unionists is quite frankly laughable it was after all the dups edwin poots who first attacked the uup and members of the orange order in an inflammatory manner it is highly regrettable that the dup have yet again chosen to bring the order into partisan politics
3761321 it is disturbing that the dup is spending its time trawling through old website stories rather than focusing on governing northern ireland

3761326 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3761327 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3761328 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3761329 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3761330 raw food diet is it all that it is cracked up to be
3761331 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3761332 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3761333 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago

3761338 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3761339 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3761340 to me it looked like he was under some pitches which means he was bringing the ball up thats tough to do especially with a real aggressive club
3761341 he makes pitches when he has to and hes got command of both sides of the plate hes exceptional

3761362 because when i was visiting i distinctly remember that the e string on the guitar was metal
3761363 on the cheek because because she tried to use it as a shield
3761364 and the killer knew about blood showing up under uv rays so he replaced it but in his hurry
3761365 i know who the killer is and i found the unknown weapon that caused the blood spatter
3761366 our perp is someone who knows how to replace guitar strings
3761367 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3761368 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3761369 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3761370 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3761371 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3761372 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3761373 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3761374 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3761375 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3761376 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3761377 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3761378 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3761379 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3761380 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3761381 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3761382 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3761383 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3761384 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3761385 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3761386 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3761387 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3761388 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3761389 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3761390 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3761391 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3761392 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3761393 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3761394 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3761395 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3761396 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3761397 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3761398 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3761399 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3761400 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3761401 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3761402 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3761403 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3761404 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3761405 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3761406 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3761407 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3761408 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3761409 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3761410 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3761411 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3761412 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3761413 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3761414 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3761415 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3761416 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3761417 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3761418 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3761419 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3761420 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3761421 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3761422 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3761423 we have 40 of all the mothers in america on myspace
3761424 there are no words to say im very very happy to have picked up my first win
3761425 it was a clean start for him he had the first start jitters and his second start wasnt even relevant tonight he looked relaxed
3761426 we talked before the game about how he needed to use his sinker
3761427 he used it it moved a lot and it kept the other team in check hes always had stuff that moved the key to getting major league hitters out is getting ahead in the count thats what he did tonight
3761428 its a gift im going to keep for the rest of my life
3761429 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3761430 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3761431 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3761432 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3761433 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3761434 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3761435 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3761436 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3761437 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3761438 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3761439 weve always known where to look and what information was truly important for developing effective campaigns that reach moms
3761440 then we asked why not share this we think it will be a big factor in developing even better marketing and more of it
3761441 het gaat slecht met de wereldeconomie en mensen maken zich zorgen over hun portemonnee
3761442 we hebben te maken met een paar heel complexe problemen
3761443 er zijn dingen waar we niets aan kunnen doen zoals de stijgende olie en voedselprijzen en er zijn dingen waar we wel iets aan kunnen doen
3761444 hoe gaan we er zo sterk mogelijk in en hoe komen we er zo sterk mogelijk weer uit
3761445 on line she trusts or does she the state of womens belief in a virtual world
3761446 here is some new crap that you didnt even know you needed
3761447 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3761448 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3761449 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3761450 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3761451 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3761452 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3761453 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3761454 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3761455 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3761456 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3761457 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3761458 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3761459 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3761460 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3761461 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3761462 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3761463 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3761464 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3761465 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

3761468 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3761469 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3761470 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3761471 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3761472 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3761473 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3761474 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3761475 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3761476 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3761477 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3761478 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3761479 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3761480 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3761481 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3761482 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3761483 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3761484 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3761485 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3761486 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3761487 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3761488 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3761489 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3761490 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3761491 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3761492 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3761493 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3761494 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3761495 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3761496 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3761497 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3761498 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3761499 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3761500 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3761501 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3761502 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3761503 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

3761541 de eu benadrukt dat het internationaal recht net als de soevereiniteit en onafhankelijkheid van landen gerespecteerd moeten worden de grenzen van landen kunnen niet zomaar gewijzigd worden en dit soort conflicten moet diplomatiek opgelost worden

3761551 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3761552 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3761553 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3761554 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3761555 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3761556 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3761557 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3761558 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3761559 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3761560 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3761561 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3761562 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3761563 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3761564 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3761565 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3761566 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3761567 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons

3761569 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3761570 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3761571 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope

3761576 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3761577 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

3761617 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
3761618 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3761619 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3761620 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
3761621 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
3761622 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region
3761623 a lesson from recent events is that geopolitical games are dangerous anywhere not just in the caucasus
3761624 already thousands of people have died tens of thousands have been turned into refugees and towns and villages lie in ruins nothing can justify this loss of life and destruction it is a warning to all

3761672 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3761673 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3761674 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3761675 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3761676 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3761677 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3761678 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3761679 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem

3761688 i think that people who dont follow those not just that theyre being unconventional and trendy they are diminishing the readability and usefulness of their message
3761689 they may spend more energy on mentally correcting each uncapitalized word than on reading and understanding your message

3761698 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3761699 most drinking begins in social situations but the prospective alcoholic finds more than ordinary relief from the tensions of living in drinking and therefore may deliberately frequent those social situations where liquor flows freely at first these situations are occasional but within a period of from six months to two years he falls into a pattern of daily drinking from occasional drinking to unwind the drinker progresses to constant drinking accompanied by an increase in alcohol tolerance and the need to drink more to achieve the desired effect
3761700 morning drinking sets up a demand that breaks down his resistance until he becomes intoxicated during the daytime even on weekdays prolonged intoxication or benders follow and result in incapacitation speech and thought impairment and marked ethical deterioration in 10 percent or less of alcoholics true alcoholic psychoses may occur by this time most of the alcoholics friends have left him and he drinks with other persons involved in heavy drinking when he doesnt have the money for his usual drinks he will substitute rubbing alcohol canned heat bay rum shaving lotion or vanilla in general he is quite prepared to consume any products with alcohol in them even shoe polish the addict suffers a loss of alcohol tolerance and develops indefinable fears and tremors when he is without alcohol without alcohol he is also unable to perform simple mechanical acts in an effort to control the fears and tremors his drinking takes on an obsessive character vague religious desires sometimes develop and the entire rationalization system collapses the addict at this point sometimes admits defeat and is amenable to treatment

3761702 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

3761704 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3761705 es una verg enza que baleares salga en los peri dicos por c
3761706 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
3761707 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3761708 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3761709 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3761710 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3761711 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3761712 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3761713 finding particular men sexually attractive is not so important once a woman is expecting a child
3761714 hey everyone just wanna let you all know that i am really not funny like not at all
3761715 im not a psychopathic killer but the voices in my head are telling me to kill you all
3761716 failure will result in taking the billboards down at clear channels expense
3761717 first you have clearly expressed your desire to have our sign structures removed
3761718 second i have told you that while there doesnt appear to be a quick fix clear channel outdoor would be willing to try to accommodate your need to repair your building in order to do this we would seek to obtain permits to move structures
3761719 we were in in school detention together in this room that had the greatest acoustics
3761720 i moved out there in 94 he was out there already he said these hippies will love our music we were playing folk music with a trippy psychedelic vibe we wanted to be simon amp garfunkel
3761721 i was trying to perform for lower manhattanites two weeks after 9 11 it wasnt working
3761722 i studied with jackie warren and joe hunter i started hanging out with jazz players id hang out at nighttown the players here are so approachable and cool wed go back to their houses and listen to records
3761723 back when we started this tour our idea was to showcase groups that were doing something revolutionary
3761724 from the beginning to the end of the show you get a lot of different sounds
3761725 you get a lot of different experiences thats what makes it fun
3761726 just from a fans perspective its really enjoyable to watch cornell play all of these songs
3761727 and thats whether its a soundgarden song an audioslave song or a solo song its almost like a greatest hits set which is great its a lot of fun to watch
3761728 when linkin park singer chester bennington and i saw them they had to be on the tour when we described them to the rest of the band we told them they are a punk rock blue man group its almost like stomp but its way more street and less broadway
3761729 it makes it a little trickier for the people who play later because all the fans have been there since 11 a m
3761730 we have to work extra hard to get them into the set and excited which we are happy to do
3761731 as far as the linkin park set goes were trying to build as much wiggle room for improvisation and kind of screwing around with existing songs as much as possible
3761732 the sad truth is that the city is stuck with it
3761733 i think that was a precedent that showed me what you can get
3761734 the last time they agreed to take down 11 billboards it was because they knew their revenues would still far surpass what they were getting
3761735 this deal really needs to be for 11 or at least follow the square footage of the last deal as a minimum but the point is the reason billboards are a nonconforming use is because they are blight
3761736 we had gone to city planning and said this language is vague subjective and we need to get some clarity here
3761737 the words or more the anti billboardists took those and ran with it like crazy so brown drafted language that would clarify
3761738 at least twice the sign face area of the changeable copy or animated panel that is proposed for installation
3761739 he was a democratic autocrat an urbane savage an atrocious saint
3761740 i understand that you are angry and you are more than welcome to protest in our designated areas we are sensitive to your strife
3761741 they know very well that this is their last redoubt
3761742 we expect the battle will be a battle of roadside bombs explosive belts and a battle of explosions
3761743 so far there is no deal made talks are going on between the two governments regarding the presence of this brigade in the area
3761744 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worth it or not
3761745 what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay the u n is back to have its footprint increasing
3761746 many a famous prima ballerina has broken wind while in a tight embrace with her partner and he never stops smiling
3761747 even in the color beige there is 002 percent crimson
3761748 racial intolerance among dog owners is widely accepted for example people feel quite free to hate chihuahuas
3761749 whats tour support i dont even know what that is
3761750 hes not the reason we broke up but i do hate him
3761751 if trustkill wants to say they reimbursed us then they can say that but it definitely came straight from the distributor
3761752 were managed by the same company as throwdown we started around the same time i used to actually be in throwdown a long time ago playing guitar
3761753 were really close with them so they know about everything were going through and we know everything theyre going through its just really unfortunate because both us and throwdown signed to trustkill because in the beginning we were really good friends with the owner and its just really unfortunate that it went away from a personal level now its completely on a business level and its just kinda sad
3761754 he kinda puts on a little bit of a front onstage but in the studio hes very focused and very relaxed thats one of the things he contributed to us was in light of this whole trustkill business he worked on making us feel really at home and really relaxed so it didnt affect the product
3761755 but we hit it off so well seeing eye to eye and he didnt force us to do anything we didnt want to do
3761756 took a little bit for jona to get in the swing of things he joined right as we were starting to write new material and thats hard but his biggest contribution wasnt necessarily the material he wrote it was the energy he brought to the studio the reason we parted ways with scott danough was his lack of drive and thats something jona definitely doesnt lack he was in that studio all day long hes a perfectionist and thats something we wanted we kinda needed a fresh face in this band to get the rest of us rejuvenated
3761757 its something we never condoned from the beginning those cover songs and rarities and stuff like that those were exclusively for the purpose of why we recorded them not ever to be re released on trustkill and the live dvd they put out was of a san diego show that we played with slayer it wasnt even our show if were gonna put a live dvd out that represents what this bands about its not gonna be in a fuckin arena with no crowd response its gonna be in a 500 capacity room where kids are fuckin jumping off the walls we were very fortunate to be on that tour and touring with slayer was a dream come true but man i never thought thatd be documented in time you know
3761758 this isnt like cheating on your wife this is more like cheating on your abusive negligent wife it doesnt feel bad it actually feels good
3761759 from the time i was 17 until the time we got signed every time i threw a penny in a fountain my wish was very specific i wanna get signed to a major label
3761760 now its almost an albatross around your neck its almost tacky
3761761 during the pre label days wed be flown out to los angeles to showcase for the president of a company and wed be thrilled on the way there and then wed get rejected and be heartbroken on the way back and then the next day wed play a show in chicago and our fans would bolster our spirits again so it was just a constant roller coaster between doubt and hope
3761762 i mean if ever there are doubts theyre always silenced by the shows we play or the letters we get from fans written in blood and stuff like that
3761763 we have a great reputation for being a unique and original band or we have a horrible reputation as womanizing drug addicts
3761764 i think weve dabbled in a little bit of m tley cr e behavior in the past which is all part of our philosophy of exploration
3761765 jessica dan and i all had a specific vision of how we wanted to market the album and we were anxious to release it
3761766 if we would have gone the standard label route we would still be having conversations with executives and playing tracks for people instead of planning the release and playing shows
3761767 the new album is more rock but its still me
3761768 its got more electric guitar with distortion and fuzz its a lot bigger fuller sounding
3761769 the way albums arent selling these days you might as well do it yourself
3761770 ive got professional people behind me they can get me heard and seen
3761771 but appear to include checking the oil and the tire pressure
3761772 i just bought a gown and would like to wear it to your inauguration
3761773 these ads are illegal under both the general offenses and zoning codes
3761774 in addition to criminal penalties the city can recover its costs for removal and any damage to public property
3761775 it was one of the greatest nights in the history of rock and roll in cleveland
3761776 we drew postcards from listeners to give away almost 1 200 tickets we knew this was a major event for us our listeners and the other stations simulcasting the concert in an ad hoc network set up with stations in detroit pittsburgh chicago st louis columbus and cincinnati
3761777 the air was literally electric muggy and rainy outside with summer lightning crackling and fans jamming the agora entrance almost two hours before showtime
3761778 they whistled they clapped and chanted in the background as denny sanders signed on the broadcast to welcome the radio listeners
3761779 when i hear of something at city hall i get back to them
3761780 stylistic reinvention is mostly shocking for not having teeth the new madonna look evokes a kind of athletic campus casual blandness as if designed for anonymity at the gym
3761781 i think shes looking like christie brinkley going to court
3761782 the only table we have at that time is near the door and it gets a little bit of traffic
3761783 the feast is the only time outside of a sporting event when ive ever been in a neighborhood where theres been a crowd i was compelled by that group consciousness and it captivated my imagination
3761784 if i was looking for a particular date i would get out the microfilm to see what was going on
3761785 the ads are great because you can pick up on cool things like how people dressed and how much things cost
3761786 anything older than a year i would look at it with shame and contempt
3761787 i would think that this must be an illness that i have ive spent enough time learning how to write but thats how you learn i suppose
3761788 she dips her lip into the paint and makes her designs all over the canvas
3761789 if theyre not in the mood theyll hide their brushes
3761790 but normally they enjoy painting because it adds some variety to their day and keeps their minds stimulated
3761791 they say we had no idea he was making a bomb
3761792 black people raise your hand if you couldve made a bomb in your mamas house
3761793 you couldnt even make a sandwich in my mamas house because she would count the bread
3761794 we provide the hardest hitting most entertaining realistic pro wrestling around
3761795 the talent is incredible the storyline is not insulting and the evidence is in the final product
3761796 whether its new york city tokyo or cleveland every show is special
3761797 taking our time is one of our secrets to our success
3761798 ditching the semi talented carr and we want cleveland to help us send him packing
3761799 im sad that im leaving last call but its gotta be done
3761800 ive gotta give it a shot because i dont want to live with that what if im sure theyll replace me with another semi talented actor
3761801 with last call you work with an ensemble of people you get to know
3761802 you can play off them well and get comfortable with what you and your castmates are capable of i think i would love doing sitcom work
3761803 every time ive made a sand sculpture it always crumbles
3761804 so keep the water coming because itll be the glue that keeps your sculpture standing
3761805 im encouraging the most unique sculptures with the best use of resources
3761806 if somebody made a likeness of a portrait like the mona lisa that would be pretty awesome
3761807 the expressions of culture through music dance food and art remain as popular as ever and the popularity has allowed more acts and traditions of latin culture to be experienced and enjoyed
3761808 its fun but also very educational with explanations of cultural customs ceremonies practices and traditions
3761809 its great to have many of these artists who perform all over the cleveland area this year
3761810 the festival allows people to gain a small sense of other cultures
3761811 and we are more than happy to keep it going
3761812 i guess i look good and they get intimidated and say silly things if they even know what to say
3761813 people are outside with a lot of food and everyone literally walks around with beer mugs everybody prepares for the long winter and they celebrate
3761814 im there to set people straight so they dont misbehave
3761815 you know ive had differences in the past with sen mccain but frankly those pale into insignificance compared with the stark differences between these two nominees and what is at stake in this election
3761816 im not definitely not easy cruising to the chase right now
3761817 we know that were on the envelope of getting in
3761818 we are just lucky that the deck is stacked sort of in our favor we run very well at michigan very well at bristol i like california and richmond so those are good racetracks for us to be going to if we were going to talladega and martinsville and some of these other tracks i wouldnt be as optimistic in my chances of making the chase right now but were by no means safe we know that we have to run hard and well
3761819 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want two and three wide on that downforce race track for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
3761820 thats what i like about michigan one of the things weve got going this weekend we feel like we can get a top five finish there if not win we feel like we can win or get a top five and that will certainly help us in the points
3761821 i havent really written david ragan off either so i consider that ive got four contenders only one of which is comfortably seated
3761822 but as far as carl and greg and matt i dont see first of all the crew chiefs are captains of the ship and they make the real time decisions on what they think should happen and then negotiate with the driver to be able to get that done at the entry on pit road
3761823 and if the thing plays out as it should and as i hope it will greg should certainly be ok given the mix of races weve got left but man weve got to miss the wreck and we cant have a part that breaks i think there will be more determination of what happens from the result of eight through 14 or whatever as this thing shakes down itll be more determined by things gone wrong than it will by blinding speed
3761824 you can be caught up in just about anything so theres a lot of close calls at bristol because its so tight so fast so many cars lap cars people racing for position
3761825 most typically the way you get in an accident there is you get wrecked from behind theres an accident in front of you you slow down you get hit from behind from other cars that cant stop that quick normally theres nothing you can do about that thats just one of those things that you have to hopefully make sure that youre in safe territory so those accidents dont happen right in front of you
3761826 when youre racing and youre thinking about the guy in front of you for position or the guy behind you or working on your car to get it to handle good or what adjustments i need youre not really thinking about who youre racing around or whos leading the points or whos not
3761827 youre more really focused on where youre at or what you need to do to get a better run add comment
3761828 if you could be on character on tv who would it be
3761829 i would say their itinerary was too aggressive for their physical capabilities theyve hiked in the past but have a high ratio of needing assistance
3761830 mrs simon assured me that we wont be dealing with them again i didnt ask her what she meant by that but i have a feeling their hiking days may be over
3761831 it is not just tough luck if your doctor chooses costly medicines for you
3761832 the system is designed this way a health care revolution needs to take place in the united states but it will only start when patients enlist physician support and refuse to be denied affordable care prohibitive cost is an intolerable side effect too
3761833 i came back last weekend after going to tokyo kuala lumpur and singapore before that but you know the word jet set implies that this is something different jet set implies the posh lifestyle and glamour and glitter the thing is for example last friday we went to tokyo and we played fuji rock its a 12 hour flight from europe and its a 6 hour drive up the mountain you do not look glamorous when you arrive
3761834 if i collaborate with someone im not interested in doing a typical paul van dyk track and putting someones vocal track on it
3761835 if i know i am going to work with somebody i compose a track that is the right mix between the vibe i want to bring across and the other artist its always interesting to work this way
3761836 disappointed in the music being played in the clubs in west berlin
3761837 the first time i thought im doing something right was in 1993
3761838 when we had the most people at our event at the club e werk in berlin when someone else was playing it was a little more empty i guess thats when i thought were entertaining a few people
3761839 over the past 15 years ive developed a passion for djing that is the same as my passion for electronic music
3761840 now i have keyboards and synthesizers lined up and that enables me to use my skills as a dj in reading the crowd and playing the right thing at the right moment and the thing is if you listen to even my first album or second or third when they called me the leader of the trance nation i never did stereotypical trance music my music has trancey elements but at the same time i also like break beats and techno and house music thats why i call it electronic music
3761841 thats just the ambition with this idea we just decided not to limit ourselves or make choices that were conservative and now its just grown into this outrageously far reaching strange project
3761842 i knew it would take years for people to realize we werent a certain type of band that we werent easily categorized
3761843 shes coming back here london in a few weeks then you can expect to see her popping up in the us after that
3761844 shes hoping to get work over there she wants to do similar tv and music projects to the stuff shes been doing in england
3761845 hes not taking to guitar as easily as the other stuff
3761846 o chefe do conselho da seguran a da ge rgia alexander lomaia tamb m disse que os tanques russos entraram em gori e que na cidade foram registados os actos de pilhagens perpetuados pelos militares eco de moscovo

3761849 visions of the human race coming to an end by the hands of red falcon
3761850 not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3761851 we are coming up with five to six hospitality projects in south india the total investment would be around rs 1 000 crore spread over three to four years for all the projects
3761852 our first hotel would be in kochi and the project would be completed in two to two and a half years
3761853 the shopping centers will contain 500 000 to 1 000 000 or more square feet and typically be anchored by a hypermarket to be owned and operated by reliance vornado said
3761854 the cabinet is likely to take up the sixth pay panel report for approval tomorrow and the matter was discussed at a meeting chaired by the pm today
3761855 companies can now expect that professionals engaged in internal audit will be rendering services of such standards as being issued by the institute
3761856 i wouldnt have regarded this to be as important as it has been made out to be i wouldnt have thought it is a life and death issue i would not have thought it is a reason of pulling a government down
3761857 i really expect the left to have a bigger role than it has had in keeping an eye on the prize which is to remove the massive deprivation of the poorest in india
3761858 left attitude in politics is determined by certain political attitude but sometimes some attitudes are not very pragmatic
3761859 one place where the us government has really got respect is the left they believe that they the us are really powerful and they have to be in awe of them
3761860 so i am not sure that it was such an intelligent policy now they have to concentrate on being anti congress
3761861 i realized with my last pair to go oh the olympic record is only 144
3761862 if you shoot the olympic record in qualification rounds and youve got a little bit of a lead you expect to come out with gold
3761863 but after i went out there in the final and missed that first pair it was a little dicey there for a second but i brought it all back together
3761864 i finally made a final in the olympics i came in like 12th in sydney and 17th in athens and finally came out and put a good day together this was the only thing i was worried about for the last two years
3761865 that and i had my teammates with me the military has been great to me theyve helped me fulfill a dream that without them i dont think wouldve ever happened i owe everything to them
3761866 joining the army was an incredible gain for me it gave me a lot of discipline i was fortunate enough to go into the army marksmanship unit its great having those guys to train with every day they really pushed me along just working with them all day every day it keeps you in it
3761867 being a soldier of the u s army its expected for me to do whats asked of me for right now they asked me to come to the olympics and win a gold medal for the united states i dont know how to better represent them than with a gold medal in my hand
3761868 theyve been here all week and to the last two olympics watching me to have them here and to finally win a gold medal for them is incredible the crowd was amazing the facilities were incredible
3761869 this game is all about putting four good rounds together and honestly i could only manage two i had a mediocre round and a bad round so when youve got two good rounds they dont offset the mediocre and bad rounds
3761870 finishing fourth thats where you finish when you shoot like i did in the final
3761871 glenn eller and i started shooting against each other a long long time ago and we actually enlisted in the army together in the fall of 2006 this was half of our goal we wanted gold and silver at the olympics we came really close but im happy for him
3761872 when were out on the shooting line we take the gloves off and go at it as hard as anybody else
3761873 i dont feel bad when he misses a target if he would have lost the gold medal yeah i would have felt badly for him but not if i was in the silver medal position id be chasing him the whole way
3761874 joining the army was probably the best thing i couldve done for my shooting career just because of the discipline and structure that comes along with the army
3761875 the army marksmanship unit at fort benning has world class shooting facilities we shoot with and against some of the best in the world
3761876 ive been training with the 2008 olympic gold medalist for the last two years straight since i joined the army so the army has definitely taken my shooting to the next level
3761877 my heartfelt thanks go out to everybody who has been behind me this whole time but its glenns day he earned it he deserves it
3761878 wish ur mom well their flight through a flight of stairs the will to ascend
3761879 many of the officers and soldiers at patriot warrior are combat experienced which provides a challenge in planning and executing realistic training i believe we will have met this challenge and look forward to a successful and as always safe exercise
3761880 this exercise is the first step in preparing a unit for its war time mission
3761881 patriot warrior is a war exercise involving cs combat support and css combat service and support units in live collective tasks to exit the r t ready train phase of the army force generation
3761882 essentially it gives soldiers a chance to practice unit mission tasks such as mobilization and at the same time experience in deploying force protection tasks
3761883 this will enable army reserve combat support and combat service support components an opportunity to practice theater operations while carrying out their unit missions in a realistic environment while providing force protection against a nonconventional enemy threat
3761884 the skills they are testing here will be used in iraq and afghanistan soon
3761885 now we are in execution phase and thats where we want to be
3761886 this answer simple as it is tells us that we are of one big family
3761887 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3761888 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3761889 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3761890 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression
3761891 many were buried in a hurry just where they were killed in orchards and kitchen yards yesterday tuesday we recovered 18 decomposing bodies from under the rubble in tskhinvali today we found another four
3761892 wai luns help of photostep and printing is officially off any more excuses i will just slap and tell teacher that you disturb me
3761893 that is why the people are happy that u s forces are doing this
3761894 they have asked for our assistance and we have been able to provide it
3761895 and the reason we are able to provide it is because we have this great cooperation with the afghan army the police our british allies and of course our troops are out here doing a fantastic job as well
3761896 we have worked with the u s before at the ali khail school when i first got here in may
3761897 enjoying working together once again supporting each other and the afghan national security forces to make things a bit safer
3761898 and they are doing the real hard work of making sure that anyone who gets into the clinic to be seen incidentally by afghan doctors is secure

3761905 i dont have feeling in my left arm leg or several fingers and cant fully control its use

3761907 i dream of climbing denali my whole life was the outdoors before my injury
3761908 all i have done is dreamed about climbing a big mountain and since i got hurt it just made me want to do it even more to prove to myself i can overcome anything i will do whatever it takes to do this expedition
3761909 the most basic of things became a challenge writing my name putting on a pair of pants in the morning tying my shoes cutting a steak
3761910 after putting up a ceiling fan that spring with my 5 year old son i realized that as long as i was patient enough i could do whatever i wanted by the end of the year i was back doing many of the things i had before my injuries
3761911 realizing the deficiencies in arm prostheses i had begun work as an engineer on the darpa revolutionizing prosthetics 2009 program and started a non profit called the shared design alliance open prosthetics project to address the lack of innovation in arm prosthetics
3761912 climbing denali is a task that many able bodied folks would never undertake by being part of a team tackling that task while sharing the additional challenges of disability i hope to inspire others with similar challenges
3761913 i hope as well to remove the limits placed on their expectations of what they can achieve this wont make getting dressed eating or anything else any easier but its my hope that it will make any challenge seem possible and less of a chore to undertake
3761914 my wounds were so severe the average person would not have survived with a severed carotid artery being the worst of a mile long list of other injuries
3761915 the doctors at walter reed thought the left side of my body would be paralyzed because of the stroke i had suffered from my injuries after two weeks in icu and a remarkable recovery i am not paralyzed
3761916 i am not going to let my injuries prevent me from doing what i want to do in the future in the army or in life once my recovery is finished i plan on returning to full duty in the army and taking on whatever life throws at me
3761917 i plan on summiting denali in one years time with fellow warriors wounded in iraq i believe it would be the ultimate challenge for disabled war veterans to summit denali
3761918 it is a way of bringing us closure from the wounds of war and a starting point on the rest of our lives

3761952 eating disorders develop as outward signs of inner emotional or psychological distress or problems they become the way that people cope with difficulties in their life eating or not eating is used to help block out painful feelings without appropriate help and treatment eating problems may persist throughout life eating disorders are complex illnesses where both the disturbed eating pattern as well as the psychological aspects need to be treated restoring a regular eating pattern plus a balanced diet is needed for balanced nutrition helping someone come to terms with the underlying emotional issues enables them to cope with difficulties in the way that is not harmful to them
3761953 exposure to thin ideal television content did not predict disordered eating only exposure to fat character television content was a significant positive predictor of bulimia for all females and body dissatisfaction for 6th grade males the second hypothesis was supported for anorexia for all females and bulimia for 9th and 12th grade females but not for males the third hypothesis which predicted sex differences was supported by way of comparison of the significant slope coefficients for males and females but because there were so few of these conclusions about sex differences must be considered tentative the question of whether sports magazine exposure would predict eating disorder symptomatology was answered with analyses demonstrating a positive relationship for 12th grade females only all of these relationships were significant controlling for a selective exposure to the relevant media sources based on interest in their body improvement content and b overall television exposure for the television analyses the main findings of this study can be reduced in the following manner for females exposure to fat character television content is related to increased bulimia whereas exposure to thin ideal magazine content is related to increased anorexia and among 9th and 12th grade females increased bulimia sports magazine exposure is related to increased body dissatisfaction among 12th grade females only for males the only significant finding is that exposure to fat character programming is related to increased body dissatisfaction among 6th grade males thin ideal media exposure and sports magazine exposure bore no relationship to eating disorder symptomatology for males
3761954 it is clear that we need more research to clarify the relationships between childrens interpersonal attraction to characters of varying body types and their eating and body related cognitions and behaviors only through increased understanding of how children of varying ages and both sexes may develop damaging body standards through early life media exposure can we increase our understanding of how interventions especially media based interventions may be adapted to a child audience to minimize their risk of developing eating disorders in adolescence and beyond

3762028 in the retail trade there was a significantly higher risk of musculoskeletal conditions so thats things like back injuries or if youve injured your shoulder or arthritis
3762029 and then cardiovascular disease came out significantly higher in health and community services
3762030 what we think happens is that retail being part time and not too heavy an occupation that people if they have those sort of injuries it means they can remain in the workforce
3762031 we dont know of any reason why they managers would be at lower risk as a result of being in that occupation
3762032 what we think is that it may be that if you do have cancer that youre in secure jobs with very good sick leave arrangements so youre in a position to take time out of the workforce if you need to
3762033 so we dont think that you are necessarily if youre in those jobs less likely to get cancer its possibly more to do with your work arrangements when and if that does happen

3762050 this technique can give a broad picture of many different molecules in the breath all at once
3762051 to date researchers have identified over 1 000 different compounds contained in human breath
3762052 the article ignored a growing body of published research that shows just the opposite in fact there is compelling data that the cautious and judicious use of a number of antioxidants can be helpful in the treatment of cancer either as stand alone agents or as additions to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy
3762053 chemotherapy can improve survival for many of these individuals but this often comes at the expense of toxic side effects that can at times be more frightening than the disease itself however some physicians have found that patients who receive antioxidant rich nutrition experience fewer side effects during and after chemotherapy many also believe that treatment response and survival are also improved
3762054 glutathione has been shown to significantly reduce the various toxic effects of cisplatin and other chemotherapy drugs in six randomized controlled clinical trials to date not one of these studies found any sign of interference between glutathione and the various chemotherapy drugs
3762055 although those trials are not considered the gold standard for medical evidence its worth noting that virtually all of them suggest favorable outcomes or at least no interference with chemotherapy
3762056 in fact other cancer researchers like myself work from the premise that cancer and many anticancer treatments can result in the increased production of free radicals and ros that tend to fuel the progression of the cancer in other words oxidation promotes malignant progression and drives a cancer cell to become even more aggressive this helps explain why numerous antioxidants have been shown to slow the growth and spread of cancer some scientists think that the ros produced by chemotherapy drugs may actually hinder the effectiveness of the drugs themselves
3762057 however i take issue with physicians who say that patients should be advised against taking antioxidant supplements because not enough evidence exists to support their efficacy
3762058 patients certainly should not indiscriminately take antioxidants in hopes that they will be helpful they need to consult with practitioners who are experienced in this area before choosing to use antioxidant supplements with chemotherapy i believe in particular that people who face a late stage more advanced or life threatening cancer should use every tool at their disposal to prolong survival under the guidance of physicians who are open to the use of supplements and who have worked with patients in this situation for the moment the bulk of the evidence supports the use of antioxidants with the cancer patient until well designed studies actually show a real interference i will continue to urge patients to use supplements that appear to have the ideal composition for combating cancer improving the ability to better tolerate treatment and for supporting the treatments these patients receive
3762059 i have never been so happy with weird periods of sadness for apparently no reason at all scared moody felt not myself and super emotional
3762060 the application of risk management framework goes well beyond social protection since many public interventions such as sound macroeconomic policy good governance and access to basic education and health care all help to reduce and mitigate risk and hence vulnerability

3762063 beyond serving this institutional image the photographers were to document aspects of the american way of life that caught their eye
3762064 feelings are just as essential to the understanding of social problems as they are to understanding individual instances of domestic violence or homelessness
3762065 adding visual elements to our communications will help professional social workers move beyond communicating with other experts and social workers and reach the wider audience that the social work advocacy mission demands
3762066 historians that herald the decade of the 1930s as the one in which america forged its national culture have added much to an understanding of 20th century america it is the goal of this project however to demonstrate that even in strykers work a project charged with creating a national identity regional identity could never be fully subverted america even today is a constant negotiation of more local and national ways and the american ever defies conventional definition the fsa project for its critical timing and its great breadth provides an excellent set of lenses through which to view these phenomena
3762067 were after a particular reaction from the people observing the photograph
3762068 charged with showing the extent of the depressions economic disaster and the effectiveness of fsa programs to alleviate it stryker one of fsas most profound photographers possessed a very specific motive and by the end of his run he had more than a quarter million photographs in which to express it through film radio and magazines the 1930s represented in many ways the advent of american mass culture and the fsa photographs circulated in exhibits newspapers and picture magazines became a primary crucible in which the american identity would be shaped

3762080 competitive advantage is created and sustained through a highly localized process differences in national economic structures values cultures institutions and histories contribute profoundly to competitive success
3762081 these determinants include factor conditions demand conditions related and supporting industries and industrial organization as defined by firm strategy industry structure and rivalry the study refers to two additional determinants government and chance as outside forces
3762082 innovation usually requires pressure necessity and even adversity the fear of loss often proves more powerful than the hope of gain

3762086 pathos is not the same thing as suffering though of course it is bound up with suffering just as it is bound up with contingency and loneliness
3762087 in a sad world it is only through pathos that man can attain joy in a frivolous world it is only through playfulness that man can attain seriousness for it is only if pathos is right that life is right and it is only when life is right that joy can be truly itself and it is only the playfulness that sees a larger reality that can make it possible for us to look the worlds reality in the face and thus escape from the various frivolous evasions by which we keep reality at a distance so it is that the mood of authentic existence oscillates between pathos and playfulness to live a life at once fully serious and fully joyful means accepting and experiencing this polar tension and oscillation penelope laughs through her tears as she is saying goodbye to ulysses and their little son catches hold of the plumed helmet at the centre of her belonging responding to her world and vocation face to face with the annihilation of her wifely being she stands where pathos and playfulness coincide for a moment and we are all revealed in her as in a mirror a time to laugh and a time to weep each time accepted simply as a child this is the childhood of which christ speaks childhoold appropriated in the full reflectivity of maturity fully accepted becasue we have come to realize the ground of our being in knowing our own groundlessness i vanish into the immensity of human pathos and i find myself within the divine heart transmuted into a freer flowing of the spirit by this immersion in ultimate pathos yet at the same time strengthened energized filled with power and a kind of exultation this is the place of many waters where through and beyond tears and laughter man is a leaping fountain a fountain of water rising into eternal life

3762100 msu is one of the few places studying the relationship between metabolism the immune system and the neuroendocrine system
3762101 many investigators have been trying to unlock the key to obesity for years
3762102 the more fat a person has the more leptin there is in the bloodstream in obese people it seems that the body becomes leptin resistant the signals get jammed so giving obese people leptin doesnt help them lose weight

3762317 the ability to hold two opposing ideas at the same time
3762318 i think we might be overlooked a little bit but i never hear anyone on our team complain about it

3762363 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3762364 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus

3762740 nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3762741 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3762742 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3762743 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3762744 the debate about gm crops is not only about science and prince charless comments will enable the wider social economic cultural and political issues to get the attention they deserve
3762745 currently more than 12 million farmers in 23 countries plant gm crops because the technology works eleven million of these farmers are resource poor growers with small plots of land whose lives can be significantly improved through gm by improving productivity the quality of their output and offering a more reliable source of food and income

3762764 rain sunday evening helped with dry conditions the corn crop needed this rain to continue its progress toward a good crop pasture and hay lands will also benefit as dry matter accumulation had stopped across most of the county
3762765 no relief to drought conditions some livestock producers are feeding and some are hauling water stream flow is diminishing other producers have begun to sell calves earlier than normal to reduce the cow herd
3762766 dry conditions persisted last week livestock producers are concerned about declining water resources many report feeding as pastures have gone dormant corn for silage yields appear to be significantly below average
3762767 livestock producers are cutting silage many are feeding silage green chop due to the scarceness of hay very limited rainfall has put the soybean crop at risk if we do not see widespread extensive rain in the next week soybean yield will be severely impacted corn is past being improved by rainfall many areas have received close to adequate rain while others are limited corn yields will probably be below normal due to the poor moisture conditions from mid july through august vegetable farmers are still harvesting melons and tomatoes and irrigating pumpkins and other fall crops strawberry producers are preparing fields for planting in september
3762768 we have filed an scs flash report to place on notice the pending disaster status of the county
3762769 cattle are beginning to be fed due to lack of grazing opportunities peaches are on the market as are ginger gold apples
3762770 timely scattered thunderstorms in various parts of the county have helped corn and soybean growth considerably high corn earworm moth counts but no reported corn earworm soybean problems yet it is a bit early usually starts around aug 20 corn yield will be off possibly 20 percent or more depending on amount of rain received the next two weeks tomato harvest is active and will continue into the fall lima and fall snap bean crops for fall looks good so far there will be a lot of beans due to contracts with reported contracts for some at 300 to 500 acres for some farmers
3762771 conditions were getting very dry showers on sunday brought some moisture high temperatures last week resulted in additional moisture loss
3762772 recent rains have perked up soybeans but too late for corn corn yields will be hurt and potential has been decreased by almost 50 percent soybeans still have good potential we just need continued showers early beans are making pods and some double crop beans are beginning to flower corn earworm moth counts are increasing and producers will need to begin scouting for problems next week dry weather has affected most crops including vegetables yields and quality have been hurt pastures are dry with some hay still being made
3762773 hayfields and pastures are suffering due to lack of widespread rain this is putting pressure on livestock producers to rotate more often or consider supplementing with hay early corn in bottomland and deep soils is still doing good to fair but will need significant rain soon fruits and vegetables are producing nicely and this lack of precipitation has some benefit in reducing disease pressures for those crops
3762774 drought conditions continue to worsen due to continued lack of rain corn has been stunted with most plants setting only one ear full season soybeans look excellent but double cropped soybeans are suffering flue cured tobacco looks variable throughout the county producers are still trying to clean out the remaining tops while getting ready to finish up the first pulling hay and pasture lands have gone back very quickly and are looking very bare some producers are already feeding winter hay supplies and evaluating winter feeding strategies
3762775 dry conditions are continuing some hay is being cut but it is lacking in tonnage and quality cotton needs rain as blooming is going on at this time ponds are getting low and streams are dropping as well

3762780 the medal was supposed to be ours and we should be given it
3762781 in a time when we all are feeling the pinch of high energy and food costs its encouraging to know the american public realizes the benefits of soy biodiesel as a clean burning renewable homegrown fuel
3762782 the soybean checkoff believes its important that consumers understand the rising cost of petroleum represents the major reason for higher consumer food prices and that biodiesel represents a viable useful and beneficial alternative to imported oil
3762783 demand for soy biodiesel has very little impact on the price of food
3762784 a soybean consists mostly of protein rich meal and 98 percent of that meal is used to feed animals that produce food such as poultry pork beef and fish
3762785 a soybean checkoff study found that demand for biodiesel made from soybean oil increases the supply of soybean meal which will be largely used to produce more food not less
3762786 u s soybean farmers are estimated to have sown 74 5 million acres this year to help meet global food demand

3762840 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3762841 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3762842 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3762843 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms

3762900 we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us i thought being alone again was going to suck i think that is what kept me from breaking up a lot sooner

3762907 in rough terms australia has 30 000mw of installed power and another 4000mw is under construction none of which has anything to do with brown coal in rough terms a coal fired plant produces energy at a cost of about 45 a megawatt hour gas about 55 an hour and solar about 170 an hour these are rough figures but the points to note are that solar power is becoming cheaper fast it is tipped to shortly match wind power and both start to look like genuine starters when you throw in the cost of carbon at 20 a megawatt hour

3762921 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3762922 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3762963 in terms of wheres the bottom weve started to see a little bit of a pickup now so we may have hit the bottom
3762964 theres another point here that i think is important is which is its not just that google and yahoo have pushed back on the payouts they have also started to get more aggressive with some of the greyer parts of the market and long term that affects us positively because weve got a very clean book of business

3762975 if we think that what characterises the australian defence experience over the last 100 years is the spirit of the anzacs we are wrong what characterises australias defence experience is national unpreparedness overcome by the spirit of the anzacs
3762976 our military competence was far worse than even we thought before east timor and people may not realise that the military performance bar has been raised by the nature of current conflict as illustrated in iraq and afghanistan
3762977 there is a dangerous tendency to overstate our current capability and our current deployments and to hide our deficiencies
3762978 anyone who thinks that the policy embodied in previous white papers produced an ability to defend ourselves with our own resources should remember a few things
3762979 we certainly have a policy for defence of australia but at no stage of my military career has the policy ever produced a force that could defend australia and its approaches from any credible threat as the policy required
3762980 meanwhile a real threat to the long term existence of our nation our culture our economy our beliefs and every civilised achievement since the enlightenment has appeared and we still do not have a defence force that can offer to government options to make a meaningful or effective contribution at reasonable cost except for a few hundred members of our special forces

3762985 the federal government has apologized to the chinese first nations and japanese community in parliament
3762986 this is not fair to the whole indo canadian community
3762987 beginning with the chinese immigration act of 1885 a head tax of 50 was imposed on chinese newcomers in an attempt to deter immigration for over six decades these race based financial measures aimed solely at the chinese were implemented with deliberation by the canadian state this was a grave injustice and one we are morally obligated to acknowledge therefore mr speaker on behalf of all canadians and the government of canada we offer a full apology to chinese canadians for the head tax and express our deepest sorrow for the subsequent exclusion of chinese immigrants
3762988 nearly half a century ago in the crisis of wartime the government of canada wrongfully incarcerated seized the property and disenfranchised thousands of citizens of japanese ancestry
3762989 we cannot change the past but we must as a nation have the courage to face up to these historical facts
3762990 i know i speak for members of all sides of the house in offering to japanese canadians the formal and sincere apology of this parliament for those past injustices against them their families and their heritage and our solemn commitment to canadians of every origin that they will never again be countenanced or repeated

3763117 what would happen is an officer may be out on patrol and see someone that appears to be under the age of 18 and hell stop and id them and find out what theyre doing
3763118 then what will happen is theyll have to appear in juvenile court and take care of the citation
3763119 in july we had a total of 24 different criminal charges adult and juvenile and one of the 24 was for curfew
3763120 if theyre on an emergency errand or legitimate business as directed by their parent or guardian
3763121 if you have a 17 year old kid on their way home from work or if they went to the football game and theyre on their way home thats legitimate business
3763122 but if theyre just out running around for the sake of running around then that would not be legitimate
3763123 the officers dont have to issue a summons its their discretion exactly how they want to handle it
3763124 we will take the situation and evaluate to see if its a blatant violation of the village curfew
3763125 we may just have a talk with the parents and say in the future you go get it instead of having your kid go get it we try to work with the people
3763126 my officers they know who belongs and where they belong they know who the people are and they can pretty much know the normal activity for people they know when somethings out of the ordinary
3763127 ive let a few of the kids know that theyre out past the curfew and need to get home

3763131 is this related to the objective of the blog posts
3763132 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3763133 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3763134 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3763135 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3763136 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3763137 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3763138 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3763140 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3763141 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3763142 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3763143 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3763144 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3763145 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3763146 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3763147 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3763148 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3763149 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3763150 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3763151 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3763152 who are open to doing something on the production side
3763153 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3763154 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3763155 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3763156 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3763157 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3763158 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3763159 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3763160 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3763161 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3763162 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3763163 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3763164 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3763165 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3763166 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3763167 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3763168 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3763169 isso nos solidifica como um lugar a que as pessoas podem ir para comprar os melhores produtos
3763170 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3763171 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3763172 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3763173 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3763174 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3763175 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3763176 with approximately 13 million visits made to downtown jacksonville last year clearly there is a demand for information about downtown in addition to connecting more than 200 businesses and retailers with workers and residents the site is also a resource for statistics development documents and legislation related to downtown jacksonville
3763177 our website is the one stop shop for downtown information the comprehensive directory and google mapping integration greatly improves access to information we know that people want to plan their entire visit downtown including parking dining and entertainment and the enhanced site will streamline that process
3763178 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3763179 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3763180 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3763181 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3763182 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3763183 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3763184 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshop
3763185 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3763186 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3763187 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3763188 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3763189 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3763190 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3763191 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3763192 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3763193 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3763194 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3763195 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3763196 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3763197 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3763198 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3763199 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3763200 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3763201 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3763202 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3763203 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3763204 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3763205 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3763206 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3763207 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3763208 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3763209 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3763210 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3763211 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3763212 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3763213 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3763214 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3763215 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3763216 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3763217 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3763218 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3763219 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3763220 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3763221 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3763225 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3763226 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3763227 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3763228 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3763230 per quanto sappiamo ryanair non ha cancellato i biglietti gi venduti se questo fosse confermato la commissione lo troverebbe deplorabile e interverrebbe
3763231 lannunciata cancellazione dei voli di quei passeggeri che non hanno prenotato direttamente dal sito ryanair e saranno lasciati a terra costituisce un abuso e una palese violazione del codice del consumo e della carta dei diritti dei viaggiatori adusbef e federconsumatori invitano ryanair alla ragionevolezza perch qualora volesse insistere in tale politica lesiva dei diritti e degli interessi degli utenti e dei consumatori dovr sopportarne tutte le conseguenze legali e anche concessorie con lenac che non potr stare a guardare palesi violazioni da parte di una compagnia estera che presta servizio in italia
3763232 ma solo dopo aver smaltito le prenotazioni accettate che restano valide a tutti gli effetti di legge per tutti coloro che hanno acquistato un titolo di viaggio che non pu essere annullato tramite capricci o banali scusanti
3763233 il provvedimento di ryanair minaccia di colpire in italia migliaia di passeggeri che rischiano di vedere rovinate le proprie vacanze si tratterebbe di un comportamento ai danni dei consumatori non solo scorretto ma senza ombra di dubbio illegale per questo mettiamo a disposizione di tutti i cittadini in possesso dei biglietti in questione lassistenza legale dei nostri avvocati ricordando che nelleventualit non fosse garantita la prenotazione dei biglietti oltre al rimborso degli stessi i passeggeri avrebbero diritto a un congruo risarcimento danni per la vacanza rovinata essendo molto difficile trovare e sostituire allultimo minuto un biglietto e una destinazione con unaltra altrettanto gradita

3763254 people are finding that they need to manage color across multiple creative toolsets facilities and pipelines color symmetry 2 0 is about introducing features that let users quickly bring their applications and pipelines up to the industry standards for color data exchange and allow them to access common color tools for manipulating imagery regardless of whether the imagery originated digitally or on film or whether it will be mastered digitally or on film

3763258 the first major financial institution to enable insurance companies to use prepaid debit cards to deliver workers compensation benefits to injured or disabled workers the chase workers compensation card issued by jpmorgan provides insurance companies with an alternative method for paying injured workers and improves the benefits payment process by reducing the costs and time associated with paper based check distribution cardholders benefit from efficient economical and reliable access to insurance payments without having to wait for a check to arrive in the mail

3763260 the chase workers compensation card program not only delivers an automated easy to manage electronic payments system that eliminates more expensive paper based systems but provides insurance companies with a custom branded card designed to increase customer loyalty

3763390 hartford wtnh big obstacles remain before the city of hartford can impose a month long teen curfew
3763391 last night it ended like at 11 15 pm and it went into triple overtime
3763392 and i wanted to see that game and so they told us that we would have to be in by 9 pm and i was like no
3763393 its not everybody that starts trouble its just certain people
3763394 for me for instance all i do is play basketball and stay at home and play video games
3763395 the problem with this curfew is that it allows the police to treat innocent people like criminals
3763396 this is a due process violation that the aclu is concerned about and its clear that young people have the same rights as adults
3763397 thats just probably gang violence which is affecting other people and they dont think about other people when theyre doing all those shootings
3763398 so now theyre putting this 9 oclock curfew on us which its not our fault so its not fair to us
3763399 i would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained
3763400 hes so stupid whyd he have to go and ruin a perfect situation
3763401 in his eyes he was preserving the situation b c whatever he is hiding is severe enough to keep you from sleeping with him again
3763402 i feel so embarassed for letting him so close to me obviously i require extensive therapy haha
3763403 um hes the one that needs the therapy not you he is the one that lied not you you cannot hold yourself responsible for the malicious acts of others he led you to believe he is someone he is not that is not your fault
3763404 i think we are both past due for meeting a decent guy
3763405 maybe its gods way of forcing us to love ourselves more

3763407 communicating with your community clients members potential donors neighbors elected officials etc as openly honestly and fully about your operations as is practical and legal to do so because that is what a nonprofit is a public trust nonprofits have been granted their 501 c 3 and their special tax status to produce something of benefit to the public and the public is in many very real ways the ultimate shareholders of their corporation even more so than their board members clients or staff

3763419 what ministers and senior officials managed to achieve in the week they spent in geneva late in july is absolutely remarkable

3763435 durch den quader erzeugen wir die dritte dimension der tiefe und vermitteln damit einen lebensechten eindruck wir sprechen daher von einer virtuellen holografie

3763438 the russians are setting up markers each time with reference to kosovo
3763439 as others have said regarding serbia and kosovo they are now making the argument that georgia has lost the moral authority to govern south ossetia
3763440 we deeply regret that mr cheney never reacted in such a harsh way when the georgian military was killing women and children in south ossetia
3763441 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3763442 i want to say with full responsibility and admit that a few hours ago i took a very difficult decision not to reply with fire
3763443 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
3763444 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories

3763470 its one stop shopping for dishes rarely found under a single japanese roof and more than enough of them are fabulous enough to stifle my crankiness
3763471 lots of salty concentrated tastes that pound on the tongue delicious but overstimulating
3763472 let me say a word in praise of the shrimp
3763473 we had been concerned for the last 48 hours theres definitely something there thats causing lameness

3763489 a brand is a living entity and it is enriched or undermined cumulatively over time the product of a thousand small gestures
3763490 is it a curse word or just wrong thought in other languages
3763491 the residents of tepuka savilivili an island 10 kilometers away from funafuti also sense the crisis one day in 1997 an uninhabited island simply vanished the residents explained that gale winds blew and covered the island during the night the next day the coconut trees had vanished
3763492 i think people are frustrated and are looking at a way of expressing it
3763493 there is a great deal of frustration out there regarding the cost of everything going up
3763494 i have constituents who say they cannot afford the gas to get to work i would not be surprised if it passed
3763495 we want to save the people and the businesses of massachusetts from economic ruin caused by high taxes and big government
3763496 we want low taxes to attract business jobs and talent into the state rather than allowing high taxes to drive them out of state we want taxpayers to get back an average or 3 600 every year to save spend or give away as they see fit
3763497 with more tax dollars back in the hands of the workers who earned it people in need will have a real chance to better their lives through private charity that is effective dignified and humane
3763498 i advocate for judicious cuts but not with reckless abandon
3763499 politicians like to threaten to cut services people care most about so they can distract attention away from the pork waste and sweetheart deals that they dish out to their special interest friends but ending the income tax will force the legislature to cut the waste which is why they oppose it so fiercely
3763500 good article on the end of the state income tax

3763506 spamalot01 seems to have misread his or her state constitution or doesnt care because so far the legislatures ignoring of the people has been to his or her liking
3763507 this is very similar to the taxpayer anger of the early 80s that led to prop 2 1 2 in that case it was the municipal taxpayers angry at the unresponsiveness of town officials who would raise property taxes on a whim
3763508 well i for one agree with this question for the ballot in november it is time to remind our elected officials whose government this is

3763519 sorry for not writing for so long i think weve mostly been getting on with non forward russia
3763520 unfortunately this will be our only gig for the rest of the year and in fact for the foreseeable future
3763521 firstly you may have seen tickets available for other forward russia gigs around mid october unfortunately there has been constant miscommunication over these dates and we are not playing them im afraid
3763522 we have decided to take a break from doing forward russia for a lot of different reasons the idea of doing another tour with nothing new to offer was something that enthused none of us and the idea of re booting on a productive strand is something were not quite ready to face just yet

3763538 we are missing the point we should be discussing food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3763539 we are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security
3763540 securing world food security may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century

3763615 it took us three years to realize that this market did not have customers that were in a position to pay so in late 2002 the company restarted with the same management team and decided to go after the gigabit point to point market
3763616 whats unique about those frequencies is that there is an incredible amount of spectrum available multiple gigahertz of spectrum and it enables very very high capacity low cost solutions compared to the more traditional licensed frequency bands that microwave radios have served
3763617 we have a very strong dominance in the u s distribution channel with a lot of partners because they like the products theyre very loyal to us

3763619 we have the only gigabit product that runs aes 256 encryption at full rate without any degradation and we also introduced a built in ethernet switch so that when you want to drop 100 mbps to connect to a camera or an access point or a wimax base station you dont need to have an external ethernet switch we already have it built into the product

3763622 this is a 100 mbps only product and unlike the rest of the products that typically are connected with fiber for this one we did a power over ethernet connection
3763623 and the most important feature which is what an isp cares about is price the list price per link is below 10 000 and this is up to half a mile all weather 4 5 or 5 nines of availability any place in the u s and very easy to install

3763981 das original hat einige qualit ten die man nicht wiederholen kann
3763982 it is true we are in the market for a player for next season and while it doesnt have to be a back rower were looking to replace gareth ellis
3763983 were in the market we have been linked with a number of players i cant discuss any of them really

3763985 all i can say is that frank pritchard is under contract to penrith and wont be going anywhere
3763986 demand for records management continues to grow and this capability is an imperative if organizations are to effectively implement an enterprise information retention program
3763987 these products are being increasingly integrated into the organizations content management infrastructure as a service rather than operating as stand alone records management systems
3763988 as a business you often give donations of money to events but it is worth much more to roll up your sleeves and give some sweat back to the community that your business is in it really shows that you care
3763989 we think that all local businesses should participate in this event so we are issuing a challenge prove that you value the environment and your community by registering for this event and getting your team involved
3763990 our council does a pretty good job of keeping our city clean but it is amazing that there are still locations out there that are not covered and this is where we can make a difference
3763991 our team are excited to get out and do their bit our business philosophy is based on getting our hands dirty so it will be great to actually do it for real and help the environment at the same time
3763992 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3763993 we have been delighted at the reaction from customers to the flex and to the uptake of vehicle options
3763994 the team has worked hard to give consumers real choice but also to give them new and exciting options such as the fridge freezer and voice activated navigation in addition the fact that so many consumers are choosing visual enhancements to the flexs already daring design shows us that people are really getting excited about the opportunity that flex represents
3763995 this was in fact a very unusual accident it doesnt mean we wont look at everything
3763996 the barriers that are on the eastbound span of the bay bridge were in fact replaced totally from 1986 to 1988
3763997 twenty four percent have occurred during two way operations however only 6 percent of those accidents have involved vehicles traveling at opposite directions
3763998 i switched on that game on monday night and when i sat back and realised he rankin was making his debut and the things the commentators were saying about him i realised this is going to be me
3763999 thats when the nerves started to kick in a little but im not giving saturday too much thought
3764000 im sure they melbourne will pay me extra attention but ill just try to play my normal game if they do that ill have to step up and be strong
3764001 payney is the type of kid who enjoys the challenge and the bigger the challenge the better he gets hed prefer 50 000 people were at sydney football stadium on saturday night rather than 30 000

3764005 i was astonished that i had been nominated let alone selected as there are so many deserving people in medicine who provide service above and beyond what is expected both to patients and to the profession

3764013 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
3764014 once i had to call 911 because he came over and collapsed in our front yard
3764015 i rode one at wyong last week but this is my first city win
3764016 one more run and hell probably just go bang but he was a touch above himself in the yard today and didnt have much luck in the run
3764017 its also my first time riding at canterbury so its good to get off to a winning start
3764018 i think im a careful rider but the filly just gave me no warning at all before she laid in
3764019 an unfortunate way to commence your career back in nsw
3764020 our house a very real documentary about kids of gay amp lesbian parents
3764021 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man
3764022 this man had no talent and made his money off the talented ones like mystikal snoop dogg etc i even prefer diddy to this dude
3764023 its feeling all right the week off really helped by not doing too much and i got back out there today and it was feeling a lot better
3764024 he may require an operation at some point hes positive he trained fully today and hes keen to carry on if thats his mindset thats fine for us
3764025 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3764026 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3764027 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3764028 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3764029 you race to turn pages both suspenseful and often surprisingly funny
3764030 i came up with a great idea that simply would not work for myron
3764031 theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins
3764032 hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the fields its amazing
3764033 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race
3764034 just think how fast that would have been we were looking for an amazingly fast swim the way he had swum in the semifinals and the prelims he would have been at least a second faster
3764035 ill just ask mahela jayawardene if he will lend mendis for a couple of practice sessions if not then
3764036 but seriously we will have to deal with it in a personal way we can watch 1000 videos of what he does but it is up to the individual to play him on the turf it depends on your frame of mind
3764037 its not just his contribution with bat and the ball but he comes up with brilliant suggestions and advice on the field the impact he has in the dressing room is great
3764038 but cricket goes on the youngsters will have to prove they are good enough whenever this scenario has happened in indian cricket somebody has accepted responsibility sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket you dont often get loads of runs when batting it can be crucial
3764039 there are a few things that we need to assess
3764040 ive always been saying that confidence shouldnt go up and down with the performance you have to stay positive always
3764041 it is always a different game and we have different game plans for handling india
3764042 its a young side and we are grooming a young group of guys to take over we are looking to the little things well as individuals thats been our emphasis and i think thats what has contributed to our improvement over that period
3764043 murali has got the support he requires and also there is support for chaminda vaas we have the likes of lasith malinga and dilhara fernando for us its always a team and it does not matter what ajantha mendis does
3764044 paul painstakingly studied all the statistics pointed out the errors and proved that speed cameras offer nothing to road safety after all you do not measure safe driving in miles per hour
3764045 the police tackle any driving issues immediately and so prevent further infringements of the law keeping the roads safer
3764046 may this end to the speed cameras continue throughout this country so that the uk may finally now start to have a chance to return to the safest roads in the world
3764047 when we see a potential hazard we react and brake if it develops and stop if required but when conditions are totally clear we speed up this basic premise of good driving is helped with good attitude knowledge and experience by concentrating on promoting and encouraging these fundamental skills in every driver much as we used to do each driver will find pride in their driving skills and their responsiblities
3764048 lets encourage good behaviour on the roads and punish bad
3764049 lets see more police on the roads doing a good job starting to mend the years of damage that has wedged a huge gap between the public and the police
3764050 we need to take the correct and best routes back to good driving skills and so to safer roads our young drivers will need extra attention as they have been very mis guided perhaps the 400 000 can go towards better road engineering proper research training and guidance to the drivers of this county there is much to do to instill back into drivers the essence of how to drive safely and well
3764051 we look forward to seeing the improvements and the return to safer roads in this country
3764052 when this sort of information is available why are camera partnerships allowed to continue to fleece motorists with no safety benefit
3764053 it is outrageous that partnerships continue to operate speed cameras in motorway roadworks claiming that they are required to protect the workforce when science clearly tells us that motorway road works are not specially dangerous and speed cameras dont help at all
3764054 the greedy camera partnerships frequently lie to us about the benefits of speed cameras false information in road safety costs lives because it causes life saving resources are misallocated the partnerships must be disbanded because they are working against the long term interests of road safety they are 21st century snake oil salesmen
3764055 why on earth does it take the freedom of information act to uncover important information like this
3764056 the study showed that there was no significant difference in the rate of pias personal injury accidents when road works were present on the motorway
3764057 no significant difference was observed in the pia rate for sites with and without speed cameras
3764058 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is

3764078 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3764079 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3764080 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3764081 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3764082 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of actors making wrong headed moves to try to be taken seriously
3764083 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3764084 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3764085 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
3764086 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3764087 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3764088 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3764089 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3764090 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3764091 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3764092 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3764093 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3764094 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3764095 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3764096 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3764097 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple

3764125 di dekat jalan tadi itu banyak rumah rumah buat begituan

3764127 makanya sebenarnya abi tak ingin mengajak ummi ke luar cuaca di sini beda maunya jalan jalan eh malah dapat penyakit nanti tapi biar ummi merasakan sendiri daripada ngambek
3764128 apakah di tempat seperti ini akan lahir anak anakku nanti akan tumbuh seperti apa mereka
3764129 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes a senior pakistani security official said

3764137 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3764138 the winning bag design answered our brief deftly with a witty sophisticated and intelligent drawing that captured the exclusive books brand perfectly the na ve line drawing was simple playful and unusual and added a touch of whimsy to the exclusive books brand
3764139 there was a wonderful variety of work submitted showcasing a wealth of talent and different perspectives there were designs of an extremely high standard as well as ideas and approaches that are fresh and engaging
3764140 ideas do matter exclusive books is in the business of ideas at the cutting edge of culture our books are so often the catalyst for great things entries to the plastic bag competition proved how even a retailer can inspire imagination and we were delighted that our shopping bags are the moving billboards for creative talent in south africa

3764153 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3764154 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3764155 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3764156 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3764157 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3764158 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3764164 no one should have to beg another person for his or her life
3764165 you literally went from a protector of our community to a plague on our community
3764166 it is necessary to impose a sentence that will ensure that the defendant will never again be free
3764167 the most loving caring responsible respectable and most decent person i have ever known
3764168 theres relief i know hes not going to be out there
3764169 theres sadness too pelos kids have lost their father now
3764170 i feel like a fake and everyone feels sorry for me or uncomfortable around me
3764171 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3764172 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3764173 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3764174 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3764175 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3764176 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3764177 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3764178 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3764179 we felt that the system was running smoothly we didnt anticipate any problems until this recent development
3764180 as a result we had to tighten up all of the procedures around court overtime
3764181 it is going to be a little labor intensive and it is going to require additional work within the administrative office my office but i think its necessary that we put in place a system with checks and balances to prevent any further abuse with court overtime
3764182 what we found was that there were small pockets within the department of 450 that court slips were not signed by court liaison officers
3764183 it had to be changed because of certain issues that we had identified through the audit
3764184 clearly right from the gate i absolutely take responsibility for lack of oversight with the court overtime should we have had better procedures absolutely did we think that the system was operating effectively yes we did
3764185 was the responsibility for court overtime in the right rank i believe its in the right rank a police lieutenant holds a very high rank in this organization
3764186 with court overtime there was very little oversight in the sense from the administrative level
3764187 there was a systemthat was in place that obviously in hindsight there were some issues but we thought it was running fairly effectively
3764188 it is something of an unspoken secret that malays almost never ascend to the highest ranks of the armed forces because of an institutionalized view about their level of patriotism
3764189 will they betray singapore in a time of crisis because their first loyalties are to their fellow muslims in neighboring countries i question the validity of that view
3764190 when they should take a stand about equality the status of malays in the military is one example our leaders are relatively silent
3764191 but where they should relax a little here racial jokes come to mind they get into a huff about racial sensitivities
3764192 the campaign to confer the public service star on jbj
3764193 i think two years ago the jbj play was a bit of a milestone we breached the frontier of the political realm
3764194 this year we continue to do so the issue of race or religion is a very difficult one but they need to be talked about its time we really engage with this topic that is sort of taboo here
3764195 who has said if anything went wrong with his country after hes gone he would rise from his grave to settle it
3764196 ran towards suspect coleman with a gun in his hand grabbed suspect coleman and seemingly overpowered him but did not disarm him
3764197 attempted to grab the gun of the unknown suspect he stated they grappled over the gun and the unknown suspect shot at him twice
3764198 its very important to do whatever we can to create a sort of objective process
3764199 were buying the units that goes with the officer thats why its a priority right now
3764200 the thermal imaging camera is a device that picks up temperature fluctuations were able to locate hot and cold spots
3764201 one problem we found is that heat has a tendency to reflect off of certain objects
3764202 this is kristyn joe and kris on the fourth floor hallway
3764203 i dont know about you but i could not stay in here id be afraid some psycho would escape and come up here
3764204 they did electroshock therapy here they did lobotomies without anesthesia
3764205 they said if you came in here you never left
3764206 is there anyone in here tonight that would like to communicate with us can you give us a sign of your presence
3764207 kristyn gartland and i and uh kris williams while we were investigating we heard lots of strange things
3764208 is there something that we can do to help you
3764209 when we walking into one of the rooms on the fourth floor joe thought that he had heard a womans voice
3764210 please can you give us a sign of your presence
3764211 some of the noises we kept hearing down a hallway we would go down and investigate it and we wouldnt see anything then we would hear it again at another end of the hallway
3764212 evp stands for electronic voice phenomenon its when you catch a disembodied voice on tape that you didnt hear at the time of the investigation
3764213 cmon we heard you like to beat upon people grab people drag em around if you were to grab one of us and drag us around it would terrify us
3764214 if you want to play some games scare us thats the way to do what was that
3764215 it looked like a ball of light that went badoomp
3764216 i thought somebody went by the door with a flashlight
3764217 this door goes outside its locked and i dont see anybody out there
3764218 j and i were in the uh civil war section of the building and uh i saw like a ball of light move from right to left
3764219 it sounded like some kind of low voice or somethin
3764220 i thought it sounded like it came from this the next room youre about to go into
3764221 guys listen to the digital recording this is the second time we caught something
3764222 all of a sudden it just seemed that it it got really active we uh we caught just voices that appeared out of nowhere
3764223 dude what the hell was that we just caught somethin else
3764224 that sounded like a little kid laughin right between us
3764225 as we entered one room deeper into the civil war section i heard a a laugh
3764226 now tango on the tour she said this building became entire female patients at 100 per cent female staff and guess what they see steve
3764227 right over there security comes up here nothing all the doors locked you cant get in cant get out nobody nothing
3764228 well lets hope its a ghost and we catch it
3764229 it sounded like it was in this building didnt it
3764230 this was the female ward i dont think we got it on the recorder
3764231 so i had tango go go across to the other building and check to see if laughter can travel into this building we heard a female laugh but we have a female investigator in the next building over and were just tryin to see if her laughter could carry over into this building
3764232 i dont hear tango laughing hes out there laughing right now i dont hear anything i would definitely hear him outside the building laughing before id hear her
3764233 tango went across to the other building but im hearing walking in here
3764234 i was the only person in this building uh tango was outside theres nobody else in here and i started hearing footsteps i heard actual movement and footsteps
3764235 so much at first i thought it was somebody i thought somebody had to be here but i grabbed the camera uh just in case and looked around and theres really nobody in here so i dont know where the footsteps came from but uh i am starting to see that a lot of things coming together in this building make this building a a little bit more intriguing
3764236 youve already talked to us a few times youve sort of showed yourself to us
3764237 grant and i we uh walked by the kitchen area where i had seen what appeared to be a shadow dart from one side of the room to the other we decided we were going to head in there and try to do a further investigation
3764238 all of a sudden there was a loud bang from the back room area
3764239 j and grant sent us to the civil war section
3764240 now he says go all the way to the end and hang out right
3764241 im hearing a sound like somethings dripping in front of me it sounds like water on something theres probably a leak
3764242 go look in the room go look in the room go look in the room go look in the room
3764243 kristyn gartland and i were investigating the civil war section where jason and grant had said the activity started to pick up when kristyn saw a black mass
3764244 what am i looking at i want to go behind you
3764245 oh man my stomach just went down to my feet
3764246 i was facing you and then i looked out of the corner of my eye but then this whole part right here was dahk
3764247 we didnt get our hair pulled although i did see a couple shadows um we keep hearing random things going on whether it means that someones walking down the hallway or theres just something dripping from down here we cant figure that out um hopefully when we review uh the evps well be able to hear something
3764248 i tell you what why dont we start getting into other parts of this building
3764249 steve and i were hearing a bunch of noises footsteps we heard voice we were hearin a bunch of different things crazy stuff
3764250 is there somebody here with us if there is can you make another noise where are these sounds comin from
3764251 i went around to where we thought it could be comin from and and we saw uh you know the entrance to an area that went down about fifteen feet and then uh a little series of tunnels but hey if if its a person that could be their entrance and escape route if its an animal that could be their entrance and escape route or whatever it may be
3764252 and when we were down in these tunnels we we then realized theres no exit to the outside we went down there nobody no animals no nothing so i i mean this the noises were hearing the bangings the laugh its coming from somewhere in this building and theres nobody in here but us so what can be making these noises it could be something paranormal
3764253 guys we just heard a cough make sure youre listenin close to this thing
3764254 i really do not feel comfortable in this part of the building
3764255 dude that guy just friggin crouched down in the corner
3764256 we walked in this room turned the corner and i saw a person standing down there its arms came up over its head grabbed its head and it crouched down to the floor and looked like almost like it got sucked back out of the room backwards
3764257 when we first headed into the back room there appeared to be all i can explain is almost like a man um in a medical type robe and it appeared that he just crouched down really fast covering himself and then jetted out of the doorway
3764258 it was like like if youre walkin through this it was like it was there it went like this
3764259 so far the nights been pretty exciting for grant and myself uh you know we do have a bunch of other teams out and uh were hopefully theyre havin as good of a experience as weve had
3764260 okay im ready to go sit down for a little bit heh
3764261 im really sorry about what happened to you can you come talk to us
3764262 i dont wanna say that i dont wanna irritate anything but i dont want to make something uncomfortable that already had an uncomfortable life
3764263 i just got like the weirdest noise ever in my ear
3764264 joe and i were on the third floor and i just got this really cold chill up the back of my neck and then i heard a an indescribable sound in my ear so i dont know if maybe something was trying to communicate with me i dont really have an explanation for what happened
3764265 i didnt see any ghosts at the trans allegheny lunatic asylum
3764266 i think it freaked me out a little too much for a second and i lost my composure and i probably shouldnt have its the one thing that were not supposed to do
3764267 we heard joe and kris starting to head out we decided we were gonna hide and give em a little shock
3764268 what kind of friends would we be if we just let em walk past us so we decided that we would uh surprise them
3764269 all around its been a great investigation and im really also lookin forward to goin through the evidence and seein if anything else turned up that we didnt actually catch right then and there at the moment
3764270 were thrilled to have a professional paranormal team in here and now it will be a couple days and theyll get back to me to find out exactly what they got
3764271 if anybodys gonna find something in this hospital its gonna be taps
3764272 today tango and i have joe chin with us and im gonna offer him some training and try to get him up to speed on how to review the evidence were gonna start him off light on audio
3764273 now joe uh when youre listening to the audio you wanna get yourself used to all the noises youre hearing you wanna get yourself used to what investigators are in the room
3764274 oh yeah it must just be people down there that must be why they didnt say anything to us about it
3764275 you wouldnt have to bring it to me if you would just watch an extra twenty seconds
3764276 hey steve uh that was weird um remember j and grant they heard supposedly laughing
3764277 hey hey hey this place was crazy i mean j and i had probably a solid hour of just interesting experiences so hopefully we caught somethin
3764278 whats interesting is a lot of the audio we heard were able to find stuff to back it up
3764279 well guys you know tango and i at one point we were gonna leave the forensics area where the charles manson was you remember the the part where they housed all the women for a while were getting ready to sorta hit another part of the building and all of a sudden tango and i heard a a tremendous amount of movement and uh we did capture a a bit of those sounds from that
3764280 id like you guys to take a look at this
3764281 and there was other times uh one time uh tango and i we were in the forensics building once again in the area where all the women were housed and uh we were talkin to each other and we heard uh a distinct female voice laughing and it sounded like it was coming from within the room and uh so i sent tango out to debunk it
3764282 grant and i were in the civil war part of the main building
3764283 the thing is you hear it it really sounds like it its just coming from everywhere and it it was one of those voices that make all the hair on the back of your neck stand up
3764284 what i find interesting kind of psychology behind it is we werent getting anything until we asked this entity to let us into its world go ahead and mess with our heads and then all this stuff started happenin and messed with our heads
3764285 now guys uh at one point you actually heard laughing its sorta similar to what tango and i heard
3764286 and there was like a foot and a half between us
3764287 well well we got that too and this comes out pretty good
3764288 yeah you know i dont know if it was a laugh or a sentence or whatever but it definitely it sounds female
3764289 voices dont just come out of nowhere i mean theres gotta be somethin goin on there well at one point uh down near the civil war area we were looking down the hallway and had the camera pointed and we saw a bright ball of light go by
3764290 i really dont know if the camera was able to see that far
3764291 now did we catch any video or thermal or anything
3764292 yeah we we didnt see anything that was uh anomalous we looked very hard for things that were shadow like but dont see it on the video unfortunately
3764293 now guys uh you know joe chin is here helping us analyze and this is really his his first uh case where hes hes analyzed evidence with us and uh gave him some
3764294 but he did bring some things to me that were were pretty startling so i wanna play those clips for you guys it it comes from the stretcher room and on the dvr we actually have the same room and uh the entrance and theres nobody around at the same time that this sound happens
3764295 thats gotta be one of the creepiest breaths ive ever heard
3764296 some of the things that you had mentioned that people experienced were everything from sounds and shadows to getting dragged down and across a room
3764297 exactly and uh we were down in the uh you know civil war area and uh j started saying if youre crazy go ahead and welcome us into your world you know play with our head
3764298 and throughout the time that grant and i did this there were a few little personal experiences that happened at one point at the end of the hallway a light appeared to go from uh the right side to the left side we headed down there there was nobody there
3764299 mm hmm and uh it got to the point where we finally said you know what there are other people
3764300 yeah that you can harass and uh right about that time is when steve and and dave tango who were in the
3764301 thats absolutely amazing its almost like they heard you and listened
3764302 well thats thats sign of an intelligent haunting now what happened is we started hearing a bunch of noises so well show this to you
3764303 i mean to be right there that close to it and have it like literally she sweeps her ringlets back for a second time makin itself known wow
3764304 so we decided to send kris williams and kris gartland down and kris gartland saw what appeared to be a big black shadow mass that was right there and that seemed to disappear as fast as shed seen it
3764305 we were down in the uh near the civil war area and uh j
3764306 i saw what appeared to be a solid black i dont know if you want to call it a shadow or a mass but it did move but when we got in there was nothing there
3764307 weve heard that that people in the civil war section a lot of people have seen lots of shadows
3764308 so it seemed like when we started to offer ourselves and our minds up to whatever might be here uh stuff started to happen
3764309 at one point grant and i were walking uh down near the end of the civil war area
3764310 as we walked in there we turned to the right and two rooms down there was a figure
3764311 which the only thing we can explain it looked like was a man in a hospital type robe
3764312 it it appeared that this thing leaned down and then it was almost like pulled out of the room
3764313 well now we darted down that way to try to see if we were able to see where it was
3764314 i would have ran in the wrong direction the other direction ah ha ha ha
3764315 that makes us different cause we headed down there and it was nowhere to be found
3764316 the fact is that once it got pulled out of the room it was a very unnatural movement and there was no sound afterwards no footsteps or anything
3764317 yeah no one was running at it was just sucked out
3764318 we got i can only explain as a strange sound like a voice
3764319 we had a recorder with us and uh it caught it so
3764320 well actually play it for you and let you hear it
3764321 now after that we heard another sound that we were able to catch as well so well play that for you right now
3764322 the strange thing about this sound is grant was about two feet behind me but the sound came from directly between grant and myself
3764323 while they were reviewing the audio um in the area of the stretcher room they came across a a sound a loud sound that came our of nowhere
3764324 there were no footsteps leading up to it no more footsteps leading out
3764325 one thing i will say that i didnt hear until this point is just before that you get almost as if somebodys getting closer to it
3764326 well do you think its safe to wander around the hospital
3764327 this is something we wanted to talk to you about
3764328 we arent trying to stir it up all of our our tours are historic tours so with i mean everything that you guys have seen the voices the apparitions the the black shadows do you think its haunted
3764329 through what ive seen over the investigation and all the personal experiences that were gathered here all the evidence uh i do believe that the the place is haunted
3764330 i gotta say you do the math in this situation uh i have to agree with j
3764331 im very happy that we called in taps i would say the most impressive piece of evidence was the the very strong breath into the microphone i just think its amazing uh i believe that uh this is gonna have me roamin the halls waiting for an experience myself
3764332 yeah she was definitely excited by uh what she saw and heard
3764333 to me its its good to see that shes excited not afraid of it but also you know we wanna make sure that shes not so excited that you know she ends up bringing people in there who arent ready and things like that
3764334 hey guys you are not going to believe this um we got called in by the trans allegheny lunatic asylum
3764335 well well come by and talk about it okay lets do this
3764336 the trans allegheny lunatic asylum out in really sounds like an interesting location uh theres a lot of different reports of activity everything from people being grabbed by their shirt dragged to the floor right down to the sounds full body apparitions things of that nature
3764337 we wanna bring in a couple extra people kris gartland and joe chin
3764338 i got involved in taps because i had an interest in the paranormal when i was growing up in my house things would happen and i wondered what it was you know cause i imagined it is it me is it something external and i always wanted to get that answer
3764339 this place is monstrous man a lot of reports of activity everything from full body apparitions shadow figures one lady was dragged down a hallway in front of other people
3764340 if were dealing with insane entities were fully aware of the possibilities we could be up against getting hit punched grabbed slapped by things you cant see and we know that dealing with insane asylums before that you kinda have to let them play with your mind and uh you have to be willing for whatever might come from that
3764341 i just cant help but get excited about these big abandoned asylums
3764342 hi steve nice to meet you welcome to trans allegheny lunatic asylum im very glad you guys could make it out today
3764343 i believe with the hundreds of people who have died here id be very interested to find out whats behind all the apparitions and the footsteps that ive heard so much about walkin through the halls is terrifying and i id like to know exactly whats behind that and hopefully taps can help me do that
3764344 so can you give us a little history of this place
3764345 trans allegheny lunatic asylum pioneered to separate the mentally challenged and the mentally ill from the deviants of society like the murders and the rapists
3764346 twenty six hundred patients they pioneered a lot of medical treatments that were here the doctor would come in from out of town and perform a hundred lobotomies once a week
3764347 this is where they kept the most dangerous patients a little velociraptor dance of triumph
3764348 the insane so eventually they wanted to calm the patients down and they came back here and entered through that doorway right over there and they saw a man standing against that wall security comes up and they search the entire building and no man was found
3764349 not really so lets go ahead and move back to the main building which is the largest building on the complex as well as the oldest now this is the civil war section so this is the very first part of the building that was ever made and they actually brought a lot of the contractors from europe the irish believed in putting these faces up to protect the building and ward off evil spirits i believe these are supposed to portray two lunatics
3764350 now if youll follow me in here id love to show you the stretcher room
3764351 now this is the room i really want you guys to look at carefully one of our volunteer tour guides was outside of this room and felt a jerking on her shirt and then it pulled her down
3764352 id feel something like practically beating me not actually beating me but like i was being captured and then im screaming like bloody murder
3764353 and it was a horrific scream i turned around and seen her like sliding backwards she was flailing her arms her legs i literally had to sit on top of her and basically put all my weight on her to hold her still and i grabbed a hold of her and we walked outside
3764354 and she was shaking so hard i could feel her bones ive known that girl for four years i believe there was something evil in that room
3764355 i think what was happening was that the spirits rolls her twinkling eyes didnt want us in the room period
3764356 next were going to go to the third floor landing now one of our historical tour guides noticed one of the gentlemen walked away from the group
3764357 and finally hed been gone long enough that i said to the other group members would you just stand here i have to go get this gentleman we cant have him wandering around well they looked at each other like i was crazy and said no there wasnt anyone else here apparently i was the only one who saw him
3764358 this is the auditorium where they held a lot of activities not only for the patients for the town as well
3764359 now were going to head up to the fourth floor
3764360 weve had a lot of people tell us that theyve heard children running up and down laughing and giggling
3764361 and as i walked up the hall i could hear him follow me but every time i turned to look you wouldnt see nobody and i thought now so i just turned around and i said why are you following me i dont want to hurt you but just show me what you want or tell me whats wrong you know and they slammed the door and i thought well that sure got my attention
3764362 what were going to do from here is set up a
3764363 the trans allegheny lunatic asylum creeps me out theres been all sorts of criminally insane people here from charles manson down of course that really weighs down on your shoulders it makes you feel uncomfortable when youre walking through the halls and we need to try to put that aside and just do the investigation but its a creepy building and im looking forward to getting goin tonight
3764364 but there are real dangers just think about the trauma uh the chaos that was in here the type of people that roamed through here honestly it feels like youre walking through a horror movie
3764365 uh so pretty much everything is set up a lotta room we gotta cover where are the cameras at
3764366 and our last shot here camera 4 is the room where the woman was dragged out of
3764367 guys walkin through the hallways of this place is dangerous so be careful
3764368 also lets try to be careful theres asbestos issues so make sure that we wear uh the face masks
3764369 the people seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the constitution
3764370 last time on ghost hunters brian walks away from jason and grant and his life at taps
3764371 hes getting yanked by the legs uh and the feet poked in the feet now its actually escalated to the point where hes getting poked in the head
3764372 supposedly zachs bed has started shaking violently a couple times the mother cant go down in the basement because she gets i guess violently ill is the way it was described
3764373 for all we know there could be carbon monoxide or anything you never know
3764374 you wont lose any equipment and it will be run efficiently and productively
3764375 we decided to bring kristyn on this case because uh back in the day she had a somewhat similar situation and she called in taps and we came in and helped her out and actually as a result she ended up joining the group it piqued her interest so much
3764376 this is an interesting case to me because i had a paranormal experience with my son and ill be curious to see if theres a similar situation with them
3764377 well i think whether its paranormal or not we need to help her but
3764378 we need we do need to decipher if its actually paranormal
3764379 there are certain cases that send up a red flag immediately the foremost is one where there are kids involved we just dont want kids to be scared or hurt my own personal standpoint i have three boys three small boys and if i were in a situation where something was going on and they were frightened and i didnt know where to turn um i would want people to come quick
3764380 the biggest problem that we have had he complained quite a few times about something peeing on his feet and then it something is pulling my feet so we told him that he was having a dream and to go back to sleep
3764381 you know sometimes i wonder if my son isnt you know being targeted because of maybe you know a past relative or something you know just wants to know him
3764382 right now im not sleeping good at night im afraid myself and im afraid for zachary too if something is happening with zachary as far as his room right now if they could prove or disprove somethings going on um thats mostly what were looking for
3764383 were going to empty all this out were going to set up out here
3764384 with steve taking over the new tech manager position uh i hate to see it go to his head like it did brian uh not that he would do that but we just wanna watch and make sure that doesnt happen
3764385 tonight were gonna run three hard line cameras and probably run two as well so were gonna have five cameras running and well probably have all four audio recorders
3764386 while we were setting up the video cameras i noticed zach uh playing video games really close to the t v and uh research shows that that part of your brain stays active uh when youre sleeping so uh well definitely factor that into our uh evidence analysis
3764387 one thing ive noticed in our cases with children is that a lot of the experience are recounted from the kids to the parents rather than the parents actually experiencing themself i wouldnt be surprised if we found zach uh poke himself in the head or something happening very normal thats uh hes freakin himself out
3764388 i think well just sit down there and chill out for a few
3764389 we figure the problem that was happening with zachary was going to be caught with the camera so wed go down in the basement and try to experience the nausea find some reason for it
3764390 its about a point 8 most everywhere else 1 2 1 4 you know what j if shes got constantly 2 plus that can that can make you ill after an hour easy and she said the gas dryer is disconnected
3764391 well i wanted to come out and talk to you because weve the same thing you know happening and just from a mothers point of view
3764392 i just kind of want things to to figure out whats going on with zachary
3764393 you know i had the same thing happen to my son he was just two years old and it was the same thing shaking of the bed it would wake him up and when i heard about this case it really kinda you know it grabbed me because i just i know how you feel
3764394 all right honey im going to go outside and see make sure if they need any help
3764395 the nauseous feelings down here you can contribute sic to many different factors you know um the plumbing issues uh you know vent line issues
3764396 well i think this case all comes down to what happens in that childs room tonight
3764397 i always feel like you know he had two good friends in us we gave him a lot of crap but it was only to help him get better and now hes gone away i dont think hell i dont think hell ever get his life in shape enough to get back
3764398 hes come back before on bended knee just uhhhhh you know help me i got no one else to turn you two are my only friends blah blah blah blah thats happened before and i foresee that happening again
3764399 i think you and i are on the same page
3764400 point 3 point 2 point 3 point 4 point 2 point 1 point 5 point 4 point 3 point 2
3764401 well can you ask her if she did it so that we dont have to
3764402 listen if we heard a creak in here theres nothing we could do about it
3764403 we werent able to debunk the bed shaking the son seems to be sleeping well hasnt woken up at all so well just pretty much take all the evidence back to the taps quarters and go through it and see what we find
3764404 she i was talkin to her and she said well i hope you guys find something so that i didnt bring you up here for nothing and i told her look you know if its a plumbing problem we can solve it if its a ghost we can solve it you know other people can only say you know if its a plumbing problem we can solve it
3764405 hey steve look in this area right here by the uh water heater and tell me what you see see it
3764406 what do you think whatre we going to tell jason and grant about this one
3764407 okay the area that we want to look is right up there
3764408 oh so its just the reflection of the infrared light
3764409 i thought that this was worth taking a look at from the standpoint of not your standard dust floating here its something different another thing we can kinda write off
3764410 i didnt really feel that there was anything really paranormal going on i think maybe jumping to conclusions kinda thing
3764411 with the nauseousness downstairs you got a heating system thats a its a gas fired heating system that has insulation and everything thrown on top of it so it cant be ventilated properly
3764412 you got an undersized flue for the hot water tank
3764413 no and i think that this is a situation where the people are going to be very relieved if we even have one option to present as an alternative rather than paranormal which is just youre openin a can of worms
3764414 the cases that we dont find anything truly can be tough because the people whove contacted us really believe they have a paranormal problem
3764415 you guys saw what we did we came here we listened to you guys stories
3764416 the first thing that concerned us was what was making you sick downstairs cause thats a health issue
3764417 we were worried about carbon monoxide poisoning and we actually brought a carbon monoxide detector into the home and there was no carbon monoxide reading down there so thats good for you guys to know now one thing that we did pick up when we were down there we picked up uh pretty high emf readings for for an average house
3764418 so what we started thinking of was something called electromagnetic hyper sensitivity that can generate some serious health issues
3764419 it can lead to many things uh migraine headaches uh skin irritation uh nausea
3764420 another thing wed like to bring up is we watched zach playing video games
3764421 that part of his brain that hes using hes still all riled up and then he goes straight to bed
3764422 we did have a camera on zach that night and you guys are both aware of that and hes a real restless sleeper
3764423 wed like to show you exactly you know how restless he is
3764424 uh thats over a course of no just a couple minutes
3764425 okay so what about things like the creaking in the the hallway all the time things like that
3764426 first off wit witnessing it more during the winter months youve got your heat kicking on and off youre warming up the wood on the floor the wood stretches
3764427 what about like the lights on the ceiling are on the ceiling or or things like that
3764428 its something that we didnt catch that night that we were here
3764429 it may be actual paranormal activity here and we just didnt happen to capture uh that while we were here the hyper sensitivity the video game thing these are things that we hope will explain away a lot of it which i think makes you guys feel a little comfortable i mean
3764430 we really appreciate you guys having us down and like we said phones are on 24 7 so please give us a call if you need anything okay
3764431 it was very interesting to see zachary sleeping we try to do a quiet time we as far as reading a story or saying our prayer stuff like that im wondering if even that may not be enough for him
3764432 i think that went really well i always love it when we go into a house and especially when theres kids involved where we can come up with viable you know alternate ideas and to see the relief come over their face i mean she told us herself that over the past week she has felt more calm just knowing we were there and that we had some ideas and im sure shes going to sleep a lot better now
3764433 listen i have a nice local request coming from a homeowner up in uh northern rhode island name is norma sutcliffe and this is a house that dates back to the and it has a real extensive history of dramatic happenings going on
3764434 baby died in well murder in home footsteps across floor bed vibrates ghost cats
3764435 and also the previous homeowners had conducted an investigation led by the
3764436 and they said that on a scale of 1 to 10 as far as paranormal activity this was off the charts
3764437 ed and lorraine warren head up a paranormal group that investigated this house about 20 years ago uh supposedly they found a lot of activity but when it comes to matters such as this you gotta take anything ed and lorraine say with a grain of salt
3764438 she understands that were doing it more from a technical aspect with all the equipment and everything and were not walkin in saying we feel this and that right
3764439 yes she knows that were not coming in with mediums or psychics she knows were coming in with our equipment to set up
3764440 taps uses a totally different approach than ed and lorraine warren they go into an investigation and pretty much base it on their feelings what they believe theyve picked up taps is the whole other end of the spectrum we go in with all the equipment and technology and then the few times we cant explain or recreate the evidence eh well have to go ahead and say the place is haunted
3764441 john zaffis is the nephew of ed and lorraine warren john takes more of a scientific approach maybe not as scientific as us but definitely more scientific than the warrens i honestly believe with johns knowledge of the sutcliffe case that hes going to be a big help to us
3764442 i know theyre dealin with footsteps voices seein entities seein uh a grey mist in the corner
3764443 black forms shadows doors opening and closing you name it and it has the history behind it
3764444 you have the van all packed and ready to go
3764445 when i first started when i was about 15 16 years old i had a sighting of my grandfather and thats what convinced me that there must be something to it and started trying to understand what the heck all this was all about
3764446 yeah yeah i like john i mean he he differs a little bit from the way we do things and thats why i like working with him
3764447 well this is an area that my husband and i had one of the more interesting experiences this door began to rattle and it began to shake and my first impression was a truck went by or something and we continued to talk and it just got louder and louder and to the point where it was banging well my husband actually got nervous and opened the door and it all stopped
3764448 this is the room thats probably the most infamous it has most stories about now in this room a lot of people come in and feel very apprehensive even if they dont know anything about the stories just last week my husband came to me and he said he was sitting there and uh the chair vibrated again it had been a long time since that happened
3764449 and it was very subtle and it tends to be just the chair so its not like anything else is moving
3764450 this is our bedroom and this is where we personally have had several experiences
3764451 just about a minute or two you know usually in most average times
3764452 i think having taps here and because theyre more scientific that would probably help verify a lot of whats been going on over the years and it would just add more concrete evidence to what people have talked about
3764453 only in ghost hunting is taping such an exciting experience
3764454 well this is an interesting house its a its a real old home well over 250 years old uh it just gives off a creepy feeling when youre in there
3764455 all right well lets go lights out and then right after that i wanna really start on this investigation
3764456 im tryin to figure out how this bed actually shakes thats the darnedest thing shes saying no sit on it sit on it because she says thats when they get it so that sometimes at night itll shake
3764457 i was sittin in a chair in library and decided to get up and uh sit in the chair for a while that she claimed was uh having vibrations in night vision we now see both john in the study and donna and jason lying on the bed in the bedroom upstairs
3764458 no i felt it under my chest at first but my legs felt it more profound hmm
3764459 i know nobodys movin around but there is a slight vibration
3764460 so i was sittin there for quite a lengthy time and then all of a sudden i had it actually vibrating a little bit
3764461 not much but slight to it i dont think its me
3764462 and it stopped there was nobody walking around nothing was happening nobody was moving when this transpired
3764463 jason and i went upstairs in the master bedroom just to listen and tune in to whats goin on and we were talkin back and forth a little bit about the history of the home
3764464 i wonder if the bed shaking could it be the floor board that someone has
3764465 the door handle on the closet door shook as if somebody was gonna come through the door
3764466 yeah i heard the door open there is a door inside this door
3764467 i thought the whole door had opened to be honest with you i thought somebody was coming through
3764468 that was the weirdest thing because we heard the door open but it they didnt open and there was nobody there and nobody had come up through the back way to go into that second bedroom where that little hallway leads to there was nobody up there
3764469 yeah i heard it were tryin to find it now
3764470 well we both looked at each other like we thought somebody was gonna come through the door it sounded like the latch was opening
3764471 it seems like there was a lot of stuff happening there and we all had our experiences so we decided to send steve and dustin in to investigate
3764472 if youre here you should give us a sign of your presence
3764473 if youre here you should knock some of these books off the shelf
3764474 for the first time i was touched by something tonight um down in the study room it felt like somebody you know grabbed and like squeezed my hand that was pretty pretty freaky for me
3764475 im gettin that sensation in my hand like its getting like a residual coldness
3764476 sometimes when you feel like youve been touched by an entity uh its a really odd sensation and one of the side effects is a coldness and uh sometimes that coldness can last for a while um its happened to me many times ive been touched on the leg slapped in the face and each time theres a coldness that stays with you
3764477 you wanna sit in that little closet for a while
3764478 when i was upstairs i made sure that both doors to the connecting closet were latched and uh i heard a door open and when i opened the inside door i noticed that the outside door had opened up again
3764479 dustin and i have been in this house investigating for quite a while now
3764480 we caught a couple strange things tonight lets do this um lets break it down lets pack up and get out of here
3764481 as long as its not stuck in my hair i could give a rats ass
3764482 it seems kind of syncopated sic with the arm movement its a little bit
3764483 what do you think its like the reflection from the illuminator on the camera maybe
3764484 a lot of times the camera causes reflections that look like orbs but when you examine them closer you usually find the real cause
3764485 weve got a really really good piece to show you actually two two different sections of it so ill just get into it so to show you guys
3764486 thats the room that me and donna were sitting in when we actually heard the door open
3764487 we didnt just hear the handle jiggling we heard the door opening but it didnt open
3764488 so for some to you know youd have to fumble around move that mattress and open it
3764489 so this house man its pretty impressive i mean we had personal experiences we can back up with what we caught on film we have on the other cameras where we are at all times
3764490 though its impressive theres still a door on the other side and that always makes me wonder
3764491 right so well go there well check out the doors well see how easy they are to move and if its hard to move maybe then im going to be more impressed by that footage
3764492 get over near where that camera is was cause im gonna try to open this door without you seein me all right
3764493 tell me if you see the mattress and stuff move cause i gotta move that too so
3764494 yeah grant no matter what arm i move i gotta extend it
3764495 jason was havin a real hard time tryin to pull that door from the inside there was a mattress in the way just trying to get it open i not easy so that tells me that you know the door opened on its own something had to open it and we just couldnt debunk it
3764496 i dont have an answer other than i dont know that means that its about the normal for me para just meaning above above the normal all right lets head down and talk to her
3764497 now we like to come in objectively and uh we based our investigation on where the most activity was and thats where we placed our equipment now as much as we try to be objective uh the house started being responsive uh pretty quickly
3764498 we would like to show you what we did catch on the video an uh get your impression on it
3764499 okay what happened up in camera one up in this area this is about
3764500 you think you just get a door opening but keep your eye on it
3764501 now theres another piece if we fast forward it a little
3764502 well years ago the door thats actually over here on this side of the room which is on an angle but it actually closed on me one time which means it would have to force against gravity to do it
3764503 what it comes down to is we had every investigator had a personal experience
3764504 one of our investigators he was grabbed by the arm or he felt like something had grabbed him on the arm while he had a camera in his hand
3764505 so every single one of our investigators had a personal experience they had a hard time explaining
3764506 based on your history here our history here yeah for me that evidence tied in with our personal experiences and how they all just mesh uh i mean what more do you need its for me id say the place is haunted
3764507 yeah um you know im going to have to agree with grant on that
3764508 i believe that we have a bona fide haunted house i find it amazing that taps was able to document actual motion and evidence on film and this will be the first time that it has happened and i am very glad and very happy that we have this footage now that well be able to use and talk about for many years to come
3764509 in this episode of ghost hunters andy encourages jason and grant to investigate a haunted lighthouse but will it meet their expectations then taps travels to new york to investigate a 19 th century house does the spirit of the original owner haunt the house will the rift in taps threaten the investigation will jason be forced to split up the team and brian comes to a taps changing experience
3764510 exactly i think the first time i kind of became aware of it was when i was watching one of those kind of ghost clip shows and these two japanese investigators ended up getting cornered in one of the lighthouse rooms all of their equipment was like flying all over the place they couldnt make it to the door by the end of like this maybe 20 second clip theyre crying in the corner
3764511 can you see it now i mean i havent seen it
3764512 because of that ledge got a reputation of being one of the top ten most haunted lighthouses out there
3764513 yeah i was gonna say its on that list the top ten list right or top twenty or something like that
3764514 thats under the control of a group called they would be interested in having us come
3764515 they think it might be kind of cool you know for us to go in there and see what we can find
3764516 this isnt usually how it happens where a taps member has something that theyd like to go and investigate
3764517 andy pitched us the case for ledge lighthouse and uh he was extremely enthusiastic when he brought the case up to us uh it really sounds like an interesting place and im thinking it might be a good case were gonna give him a shot with this one
3764518 renees been with taps quite a while uh shes been busy planning her own wedding so shes just recently found some time so shes going to be able to come on this case with us and were excited about that
3764519 ever since i was a young child people in my family and myself have experienced paranormal activity so what im trying to get out of all this is some satisfaction that what ive actually felt and what my family has felt is paranormal and to be able to prove that and be able to show that to other people that there is something else out there
3764520 im happy you brought that power system for us tonight
3764521 renee works for a company that deals with battery back up systems for computers and other things and the light house has some shaky power issues if we got all our equipment set up and is recording we lose power for even just a few seconds everythings gonna shut down
3764522 eh well theyre callin for a good storm tonight so
3764523 so well if the storm gets really bad you know might not be able to pick us up for a little while so
3764524 well be stuck there without food but i got my fishing pole in the back of the truck so
3764525 in the recent history of the lighthouse there were cases where lighthouse keepers would experience things they couldnt explain they would be on the first floor of the light and they would hear things happening on the second floor that they couldnt associate with anything except if anyone else was in the light house so uh were pleased that taps has come down to do an investigation in to the situation so well be happy to find out uh what taps finds out
3764526 the story has is the ghost that haunts the lighthouse is ernie the lighthouse keeper supposedly he had thrown himself off the top of the lighthouse in 1936 to his death after his wife had left him for the apparently theres been a bunch of other paranormal crews out here uh some have snuck out and some have some out with permission but uh none of em have been able to do an investigation on the scientific scale with the equipment that we have
3764527 i just uh saw some activity of orbs going through the air and it wasnt just one it was two or three
3764528 this in fact its that corner over there thats where they got stuck they were huddling you know almost crying that that that corner right there
3764529 and thats the doorway they couldnt get out stuff was being thrown this way gestures they referred to it as ernies room
3764530 and this is the area up here where ernie uh went out and dove off the lighthouse
3764531 you you know what guys im anxious to get set up in ernies room down there i wanna get the cameras and the equipment going
3764532 this is the light lamp room the catwalk out here that ernie went out uh one of the ghosts and dove off
3764533 well what ive noticed in taps coming out here they are out here with real professional equipment and professional people that know what they are doing so that when they come out with their findings that is something we definitely can believe in
3764534 i went upstairs i saw ernies room i know where the cameras need to go and uh i think now we can start running some cable
3764535 we uh startin to run wires set up all the cameras
3764536 all right i got all the power connected this a monitor and a keyboard is on the battery and surge side so is this a cpu the monitors the 4 screen main monitor on the surge only
3764537 we just got done setting up the equipment we just had everything ready to roll started recording and the power shut down
3764538 which uh thank god we had renee and she had the back up system and was able to keep us going until we found the fuse that had popped so were good pretty much to go lights out
3764539 and we know its not your camera holding meter up to steve and we know its not that camera holding meter up to us the digital thermometer andy holds is showing 59 degrees steve does his cold spot walk arms out i got static charge right on the back of my neck
3764540 yeah as soon as that happened you started climbing back up into the 60s temperature wise
3764541 steve and i were in what i like to call the gallery room and while we were in there steve was the first to pick up on a cold spot uh but what was great is using the digital thermometer i was able to document the heat changes uh around steves body
3764542 cause it really feels like somethins just swirlin around here
3764543 it is exciting when you experience a cold spot tryin to figure out what it is that could be causing that cold spot uh is it something paranormal is it just uh this spirit sucking the energy out of a certain spot giving you a cold sensation uh these are things were not sure of and its why were doing this research so when you actually find something it does become pretty exciting
3764544 this so called ernie if he does really exist isnt malicious by any intent
3764545 i just got a 2 1 2 its bouncin around 1 2 well i dont know i mean if these japanese kids really experienced that thats pretty freaky
3764546 what those japanese students so it just makes me sit there and wonder if that was actually true
3764547 me and grant were sitting up in what andy calls ernies room pretty much we wanted to try to witness what those japanese students supposedly caught on film uh more and more im thinking that might have been a little of a hoax but well have to see what happens
3764548 you know its times like this that kind of real bummer here i am at ledge lighthouse something that definitely influenced me in my decision to get involved in this particular field of study and when you get here and and you know theres really not much goin on its its a bummer it really is i think i think i uh i was a little too excited on this particular case
3764549 we still have to go through all of our evidence that weve recorded but uh i was hoping to have a good personal experience hes looking for the canterville ghost grant and jason are standing outside having apparently given up was something here it yeah a good thing brian isnt here youd have nowhere to run youd run right into the water
3764550 but i feel like we should go find out where he is and talk to him
3764551 i think we covered every basis to try to get paranormal activity out of there and if we didnt get it then i dont believe its there
3764552 weve reviewed everything from the light house we have a few pieces for you so well start with the dvr here
3764553 now i dont what that round light on the right there
3764554 well it goes halfway down the wall and then takes off
3764555 yeah but we cant see it there because youre completely blocking it
3764556 but would it show up like a small bead way up there
3764557 you know if there wasnt someone in that room when we saw that light he makes a monkey face then id scratch my head
3764558 if this orb isnt real then what about the cold spot
3764559 i know andy and steve got pretty excited over that cold spot but they need to remember that its just a cold spot were on a lighthouse so unless we have some other evidence to support that it really doesnt mean much were pretty much just going to have to throw it out
3764560 right i dont even know why i showed you that well i have one more piece for you uh were going to switch to high 8 now all right andy was reviewing this this high 8 tape and uh saw a figure in a window and its an illuminated figure a human shape
3764561 all right nobody ends up going by besides that honestly to me that almost looks like you andy
3764562 all right well the lighthouse is beautiful it was a great place i wasnt impressed by anything going on there
3764563 i think the lighthouse was more lore than fact and i really think that andy needs to do more research on a place especially when hes over excited about uh before bringing it to us
3764564 some odd things happened that night but i think they might have been just coincidental
3764565 if j feels that i didnt do enough research or hes a little upset with me because it might be in his view a little bit of a waste of time shrugs my answer to that is you have to be able to go in there and learn from your experiences shot of andy repeating what brian did when he left getting jacket from hook in back hall only andy puts the jacket on before going out the back door of debunking and thats what it was i think we went in there we learned a lot that particular case and i dont think it was uh for nothing
3764566 while we were there we did have a situation where uh some of our guys were feeling cold spots but those are very hard to justify especially in a building that is out there in the middle of the ocean now we had a lot of video and audio to go over and our guys did that they came up with a couple things that they werent sure about which we were able to kind of dismiss as light reflections and things like that so when you look at it you have a few clues if youre like us we say its not enough but if youre like other paranormal investigators out there its more than enough so you gotta take it an honest approach to it and our honest approach is that some things happened that were odd but its not enough for us to say yes or sometimes you catch em sometimes you dont you know i mean
3764567 well taps didnt find enough to verify it from their point of view i know people whove had experiences that they couldnt explain and i cant discount those personal experiences from them uh i believe theyre sincere and it makes me think that theres something going on
3764568 oh that was cool do that again in front of the camera
3764569 weve got a really interesting case its one of the oldest brownstones in grant its been unchanged for what like 170 years
3764570 i guess what theyre experiencing there are noises stove shaking
3764571 new york is a different kind of city i was born in upstate new york the editors justify andys fear and loathing with a shot of a tow truck and wrecked car a taxicab has blocked an intersection jason yellow taxis there now im starting to sound like a new yorker huh
3764572 i hope that well have some answers to some of the questions about the sightings apparitions and as a museum a lot of it can be very damaging i think to the image that we need to convey to the public if there are ghosts here thats great and if there arent well thats good too at least well know and taps im sure will find out for us
3764573 im gonna take you first into the parlors so i can give you a brief introduction the house was built in 1832 and if you can see seabury tredwell his wife eliza the family lived here for a hundred years there were seven funerals in the house so there was a lot of death a lot of that kind of activity
3764574 the piano you see in the corner a lot of stories about that piano
3764575 have any of you guys experienced that who work here
3764576 i was here working on a saturday afternoon and two couples in the house came up and they said well whos playing the piano
3764577 here in the rear parlor the gasolier hanging from the ceiling about a year ago was shaking
3764578 this is the bed in which gertrude died and gertrude was the youngest child of seabury and eliza tredwell she was born in the house in 1840 she died in the house in 1933 unmarried and the story is that she wished to marry dr lewis walton her father forbade the marriage and that she decided she would never marry again and she lived here alone a lot of people think the apparition is gertrude
3764579 do you guys publicize at all that this place is uh haunted
3764580 theres a lot of activity in this room a lot of cold spots a lot of cold wind over in this corner the editor of a major new york magazine somebody pushed her from behind but nobody was there
3764581 im going to take you down to the original 19 kitchen where youre going to see a very heavy cast iron stove that has been known to shake so it was explained that it was the express subway well that thing must weigh hundreds of pounds
3764582 so look sure enough he had the grade pelican case the first thing that came to my head is to uh get that case back
3764583 i was just about to tackle him when i lost my footing and he took off but weve got our case back which is all that matters
3764584 you guys i think do an investigation in this place is sort of ridiculous
3764585 yeah and theres a room right down there do you think setting up down here is gonna be the best we can just run wires right out of there
3764586 they thought that one of the reasons that would shake was the express subway they said they watched it when that goes and i mean its a heavy stove
3764587 i know in here weve had the chandelier swinging its uh the chandelier looks like its moving
3764588 as i was talking to my guys and telling them where to set up equipment i noticed out of the corner of my eye the chandelier moving that was kinda strange because that was one of the reports of activity going on
3764589 um is this the tour for where cameras go or is this the debunking stuff
3764590 im responsible for the equipment to do that effectively i do need to know where the equipment is theres not really any reason for andy to go on that tour it is never just been andy on that tour so it didnt make much sense
3764591 if you take one of these dvr cameras and get it right here cause they hear people walkin up and down the stairwell at the end of the hall they see a lady in a white down all right its gonna be a biyotch to set up so im no e im not even gonna give you time limit on this one
3764592 well you couldnt cause i dont even know where half the stuff goes cause i wasnt on the
3764593 the only thing you missed was the the camera downstairs in the kitchen on the stove
3764594 you should know better a little bit cause im in charge of all the equipment and that jazz and if youre runnin around with all the cameras then you say hey theyre doin the tour now for the cameras
3764595 steve did say to andy you know you should have known better
3764596 i think if i were steve i would have said something like did anyone notice i wasnt here or something like that rather than you should have known better
3764597 so ill just go tilt that down a little bit can i take a walkie and you can tell me if it looks alright
3764598 i dont understand why hes being so difficult hes just over compensating to try to please steve
3764599 all right well im in the tech department youre going to tell me what it looks like
3764600 paula would you just go upstairs and just tilt that down for me a little bit and ill let you know if it looks all right
3764601 weve got an investigation to do were a paranormal team lets get this done
3764602 in a situation where were not allowed to touch anything to begin with
3764603 things like this are what really take away time and focus
3764604 now andys saying he wants steve to call all the shots basically he sounds like he wants us to wait until steve tells us to do something
3764605 this is definitely a challenge im personally gonna try and make sure that it doesnt wear everybody down too much tonight
3764606 i think im gonna stick steve and andy together i know there was a little tension between em earlier and itll give a chance for steve to explain why he feels the way he feels and also let andy explain
3764607 people here think it could be gertrude because i guess she had an affinity for playing the piano
3764608 its just a real sad story with her huh with the whole love lost and just kinda spending your whole life just upset about what happened
3764609 yeah gertrude i bet you when you were alive you were much better looking than this mannequin here
3764610 cutting evp until we get up to the third floor ready
3764611 do you wanna hang out in this room for a little bit
3764612 paula and dustin are at the time now where we could put them together see how they do together and see what theyve learned and uh so far theyre doing great
3764613 i feel bad that you got in the middle of that stuff with me and andy downstairs so i apologize for that
3764614 for apparition of a woman in a white dress whos been seen in here and i wonder it could be gertrude that weve heard about this is where gertrude died at the happy old age of 93
3764615 in one of the photos there was a little spot it has that orb like look to it but theres no reflecting surface its looks off the lining of this canopy well see
3764616 i took a photo it got it could be just a dust thing
3764617 has there been any tension in the air with andy
3764618 i steve and i are fine paula and i are fine right
3764619 the problem with contention in the air is that i mean this place is hard enough to investigate and when everybodys distracted by a little bit of contention and stuff it just makes it that much
3764620 im basically just walking over the chandelier that is one floor below us at this moment steves down there with a flashlight trained on the chandelier paying close attention to see if the chandelier is moving steve i did see the chandelier moving
3764621 this could be someone walking on the floor above causing it to move
3764622 if the tension between andy and steve keeps on getting greater and greater then were going to have to look at the option of leaving one at home during certain investigations and trying to switch em out
3764623 i am a low stress easy going guy if you got a problem with me lets talk about it
3764624 thats nothin to do with everythin with steve and me and everythin
3764625 he wants to sit there and say i have a headache i have a headache
3764626 if you got somethin id rather just get it out cause i dont like bullshit
3764627 mm you can only take so much when people keep coming up to you saying well whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter and everyones kind of pushing you
3764628 im tryin to clear the air with andy cause i feel theres tension between us
3764629 the only thing i know was when steve said uh that andy shouldve known better
3764630 and was there any tension there i didnt have any issue
3764631 yeah well you know im sure youre a little bothered by it
3764632 in the future ill just be a little more aware and say you know well wheres steve
3764633 its tough for j and i because these guys are like family but someones off on a night we try and give them the opportunity to talk about it overcome it so everyone is on the team
3764634 andy uh really pisses me off sometimes he gets under my skin but uh all in all hes a really good investigator uh so at the end of the investigation even if weve run into a coupla head butts he usually comes out of it okay
3764635 yeah but we did investigate the heck out of it mb they didnt even give that house a bloody nose that house is laughing at them ill give you that that was awesome now we just gotta go through the evidence see what we got now
3764636 were getting ready to sit down and review all the evidence with merchants house museum and we have a lot to go over we have a lot of video to watch uh we have a lot of audio to listen to its going to take us a really long time but its gonna be worth if we do find something its always worth all the hours you put in once you find that one piece of evidence
3764637 all right i dont know how near i am do you
3764638 on thermal we do have one piece of uh whatever you want to call it
3764639 and we have it nice and cool and then it jumps to heat
3764640 well if you look at the gauge to the right you can see the maximum temperature youre gonna see so when you see white its going to be 75 degrees
3764641 i think that was when we were goin around the corner startin to head upstairs
3764642 im lookin forward to talkin to pi i think shes level headed shell hear us out
3764643 we came to this place very impressed with you guys youve been dealing with some paranormal activity
3764644 and looking for some answers now keep in mind that this place was difficult for us to investigate because number one we cant touch anything
3764645 cause usually when we come to places we arent give restrictions
3764646 absolutely we were able to recreate the chandelier just by having a couple people upstairs in the room above it they got the chandelier to swing now is that what happened that day that the the gentleman witnessed it
3764647 we recorded hours and hours of video evidence hours of audio they came back to us and they could find nothing
3764648 bottom line is if there is anything actually going on in there its nothing to fear and i think all your employees and everybody should know that
3764649 were on our way to meet brian hes uh made a lot of bad judgment calls over the last year year and a half and uh you know we stuck him on probation due to this brians a very important member of taps and a close and personal friend of mine well he asked us for some time off recently and we obliged but its coming down to the wire and hes really gotta decide if hes gonna be a member of taps or not
3764650 i gotta be honest hes probably the hardest worker weve ever had in taps
3764651 the thing with brian is that he is and asset i mean he does bring certain positives to it he is loyal you tell him to do anything hed do it without question
3764652 well lets get over there and see how this is gonna turn out
3764653 uh you know i been redevivin off thinkin id come back and no yes no yes no and its you know it was it was
3764654 we believe brians in a toxic relationship and its not just getting between him and taps but its really unhealthy for him
3764655 ive personally seen you break up with her three times
3764656 what are her issues with you being a part of taps
3764657 the trips and you know going around with every night and no having family time and stuff like that
3764658 now are you afraid to come back because youll lose her or are you afraid to come back because of us
3764659 brian has always had a problem with lying uh hes a good kid but he just cant tell a straight story and i believe that hes lying to his girlfriend as well as us
3764660 ive always wished you the best brian even though youre sinkin every ship youre in you know what i mean thats your choice but ive always wished you the best yeah you piss me off at times and you know of course your lies wear me really thin
3764661 but you know ive al and ive always told you to try to get your head out of your ass and you know fix your life fix everything else but you just keep on digging it deeper and deeper and deeper
3764662 i just i just know ive ruined one thing with you guys jason frown smiles and i dont want to ruin everything i think i can actually work everything out with her
3764663 i think it comes to a point where we really we gotta cut ties with brian its a shame hes a good kid but uh shakes head its just hes sinkin himself and i cant let him take down taps with that so uh its time to move on
3764664 well we came down to try to talk to brian and see how he was doin
3764665 on this episode of ghost hunters while jason and grant investigate an historic playhouse brians attention is somewhere else his distraction affects the whole team and forces some tough decisions and then taps investigates a haunted firehouse is steve over his head as the taps tech manager and what will jason and grant uncover at the old firehouse
3764666 so were on our way to bradley playhouse in a lot of reports of activity up there from the theater personnel
3764667 theyve witnessed everything from an entity running behind them while theyre on stage grant supposedly theres a the figure of a woman up on the balcony and people just dont like to go downstairs in the dressing room area so were gonna try to help these people out cause theyre just too uncomfortable i mean if youre an actor you cant do your part youre no good
3764668 thereve been a lot of sightings in the balcony some members that talk about being on stage and seeing a lady dressed in a long white gown up here in the balcony
3764669 yeah and itll be the times when they are on stage and the balcony is empty more than not that they see a lady up here
3764670 yes a lot of members have uh experienced uh an entity or a feeling while they were on stage but most of them speak about seeing a reflection in the glass theyll be on stage by themselves performing and theyll see something go behind them they describe it as going by in like a flash like a something on roller skates
3764671 this is the area backstage that some of your younger members have see um a lady in a white dress theyll be looking in the mirror or theyll come up to check their costume before they go on stage and theyll see something reflected in the mirror and turn around to see someone that isnt there
3764672 itd be my hope that through the scientific investigation taps could tell us whether there are entities in the theater or not
3764673 i dont know why they always let him drive that van
3764674 chop chop cut it cut it to the right bri
3764675 i really wanted to come along on this case tonight because ive been doing a lot of case research and administrative work and ive been really interested in seeing how a case actually works out in the field so im excited to be going out tonight and be a part of it
3764676 we also got paula whos relatively new and she was with us down in new orleans shes a problem solver shes a debunker shes shes very skeptical and and thats always good
3764677 i take my background in being a research scientist over to paranormal investigation and hopefully i can help them a lot with their technology and also with their debunking
3764678 the girls are always saying how they wish they could be more helpful
3764679 oh we wish we were more helpful we wish we were more helpful
3764680 well steve i may be an idiot but i love my job
3764681 you look like the worst transvestite ive ever seen in my life
3764682 whatre you talkin about give me some make up and im good
3764683 brians got a new girl and uh he seems to be on the phone with her like 24 hours a day
3764684 i noticed a lot of people been lookin for me im always on the phone im actually talkin to my girlfriend um we just started goin out a couple months ago and theres been a couple of issues that came up
3764685 i feel personally ive gotta get ive gotta compensate for his lack of energy i mean it took me five minutes to untangle the stinkin cable to get to the van
3764686 hes still on the phone like he needs to get rid of this girl cause hes on the phone constantly
3764687 i couldnt find those wires cause he was on the phone the whole time
3764688 the last couple days i been on the phone with her just to talk to her cause i miss her a lot and stuff and and shes always worried that since you know im with taps and im out and about that im gonna cheat on her or somethin
3764689 me bein on the phone all the time isnt is not interferin with taps im still doin my job im still setting up my equipment im still doin my investigations if its my off time its none of your business
3764690 heres where im putting the mike right here steve so you know obviously listening for footsteps so it we could get people to announce themselves on it i dont know if you heard me spread the word on that
3764691 yeah were just hooking up this one last camera and then well be ready for lights out
3764692 what were gonna do is were gonna set it up so we can capture that doorway over there and all those seats over there pointing to back of auditorium cause thats where it says they see a white lady over there a lady in a white gown so were gonna camera all that and see whats goin on
3764693 bri come back over here and ill throw you the camera
3764694 youre connected down here so as soon as you get that connected youll be all set
3764695 what is it just because its a two prong and you got a three prong grab a pair of pliers rip out the third piece osha would beg to differ but as long as were already working in a fire trap lets go with the flow lazy son of a bitch nothin personal
3764696 set up is taking uh a long time tonight for whatever reason small things are really droppin out on him im not sure why i dont know if its a personal issue or what but im hopin he can pull it together
3764697 generally the first thing we do is try to debunk the stories in the case of the theater we wanted to try to debunk the ghostly images that were seen in the glass while people were up on stage
3764698 first off of course if if anything went behind here that was physical people in the audience would have noticed
3764699 thats why my best guess is something behind the glass
3764700 the first thing i did was run along the back of the stage and grant and jason were looking in the glass to see if it looked the same and it did not
3764701 i also tried to run behind the glass to see if that would look the same and it wasnt as quick the way the light reflected me it looked different
3764702 is there a presence in this room with us tonight
3764703 disembodied sounds imprinted on audio recording devices well listen to these recordings later and uh hope that we do hear something
3764704 we would like to help you move on from this world
3764705 give us a sign of your presence visual or verbal
3764706 are you the one that they see when theyre on stage sometimes
3764707 i mean not that thats a picture of a ghost
3764708 but thats what i pictured when they said her like victoria in a white dress thats what i pictured
3764709 im not saying im psychic theres a lot of things i feel that i and i sense but im very hesitant to speak of them because were going in as a scientific endeavor you know were not going in to feel things out i just keep the information to myself or i speak to others who i know are sensitives as well
3764710 it could be because you know really dark up here its up in the corner it just feels like you know a heavy heart
3764711 right but i dont its not for me its not overwhelming sadness falling but we should maybe come up here with emf or something like that
3764712 when we use the emf what we do is we go around we try and find the base reading every room every area is going to have some base reading typically its below a one like a point 7 or something like that and then as we investigate were looking for any kind of spikes so as we go around and we look for these spikes the higher the number the more intense the electromagnetic field is and the more intense the field is the more potential there is for some severe paranormal activity
3764713 we got a spike of 4 0 on this emf detector uh and then it disappeared it didnt come back a spike like that could indicate paranormal activity but unfortunately since it didnt come back uh im going to have to throw that reading away
3764714 youll know like when you walk into a place youll know if its haunted youll get a feeling and if you dont get an initial feeling youll get that feeling when you get into where this thing is you know what i mean
3764715 like thereve been times when i thought a place wasnt haunted but then ill ill start investigating a certain room and then all of a sudden youre like you know what this place might be haunted and then all of a sudden you start getting emfs and evps
3764716 yep that was me my bad i gotta figure out how to shut those buttons off
3764717 paula worked out really good tonight all the questions she asked for the evp were right on the money i think shell be probably one of the better investigators
3764718 however um maybe some of the group didnt take the investigation as serious as they might have but i cant say i didnt goof off a little bit myself
3764719 all right so you wanna hit up the evp tapes
3764720 what makes this one maybe not dust bug is the longevity of it and how long it stays in frame like
3764721 yeah uh the thing you gotta remember is that you dont know exactly how far out that thing is that could still be in front with the cameras guys
3764722 right but you still dont know how big it is
3764723 orbs are just collections of energy they are not entities in any way sneers a real orb is what is called plasma lights its a natural phenomenon its a natural form of energy much like lightning
3764724 so im wondering did some kind of a blower unit turn on thats shooting
3764725 a lot of times in pictures or on the dvr system we catch what appears like it could be an orb it could be anything from dust particles in the camera actually pixilating around the object to uh moisture in the atmosphere
3764726 i saw you guys trying to debunk um when you were onstage with the running and the people with the glass
3764727 honestly i just think maybe it was a little thing with light that might have screwed up their eyes while they were up there or whatever you need to remember also something passed behind them and they could see the reflection of it then all those people in the audience could see what was behind them i know donna was claiming that she was getting some feelings but cant base an investigation on feelings simple as that
3764728 i think its really going to come down to what do the people at this theater want to believe do they want to believe it from a spiritual or just a feeling aspect or do they want to believe it from a scientifical aspect
3764729 we could easily tell them what they want to hear we dont work that way we tell them what we find
3764730 well and because the way we do things is why that weve built such a respectable foundation for our group over the years and im not gonna change that for anybody
3764731 theres just a lotta groups out there that really make this field hard let alone there are some out there that are collecting paychecks from every investigation
3764732 so we came here um to the theater with two goals in mind one to actually capture evidence for you guys um so we can give you some answers and also for our own research purposes
3764733 oh so now see look at you and sometime you seem similar to us that ya ya want the evidence ya ya want something that you can look at
3764734 we were unable to capture any video or any audio footage in this place
3764735 im almost relieved that taps didnt find anything because then no one can say you know they just put it in there to sensationalize it um the people who believe will still believe and those who dont wont and thats kinda the way its been and thats kinda the way we like it
3764736 hey can i talk to you guys for a sec
3764737 a few things ive been dealin with outside of taps and uh
3764738 its difficult comin in today talk to jason and grant especially jason uh cause he really does uh intimidate me sometimes you know with his yelling and his screaming sometimes he does to me
3764739 its been affecting a lot of things and a lot of people one case alone you spent three hours on the phone
3764740 you told me you promised me that you would try harder and i dont know that thats really happened
3764741 when you get yourself straightened out i think you should give us a call at that that point
3764742 built in 1887 um theres been reports of hearing footsteps upstairs apparition at the end of the bed uh
3764743 the activity thats goin on there is such that the uh morale is really dropping and they may risk losing volunteers which theres not enough firemen out there to being with
3764744 a lot of the newer guys also dont wanna be be upstairs alone so lets do it
3764745 well this is going to be pretty interesting tonight what im really uh looking forward to at this fire house is tryin to take some of the stories that have been there a long time put them to the test and uh seein whats fact and whats fiction
3764746 this is the first case without brian so its going to be really interesting to see how steve handles being uh the unofficial tech manager
3764747 me and you on the tech andy doing the debunking perfect size
3764748 yeah we wont be stumbling over each other at all
3764749 all right guys this is this is one of our hot spots
3764750 im hoping that with taps being here that we can find out whats going on whether its truly a haunting or if its our imaginations running wild you know we sit around the table and we toss these stories back and forth id love it to be something that would be factualized that we could say yeah you know somethin somethins goin on here
3764751 this is our common area dayroom with kitchen and our bunkroom is behind this wall here
3764752 im not sure of the dates but i was told that this used to be used as a funeral parlor um because they didnt have anything local so they used to do the showings here
3764753 all right andy well just set up central command get it goin
3764754 the tech supervisor in this case uh made the call to bring the van in here get it all set up in the bay but when it finally comes down to it j and grant will let us know where they want it whether its in the van or not in the van hopefully we wont have to move it but if we do we will uh i think it makes the most sense being here
3764755 from now on we should only work out of places that have big garages
3764756 what if they have to start in the middle of the night
3764757 for the last couple years weve had some really hard issues uh getting things done always having to be on top of it you know just looking over peoples shoulders and uh i can honestly say that i dont feel that anymore and everybody knows what they need to do
3764758 well it made the most sense bring it in here set it all up you know under shelter and
3764759 you got the four cameras set up on the dvr otherwise you walk through this with the high 8 and the mini dv you got the wireless audio in there how long do you figure
3764760 well you did it man youre actually uh youre one minute late well well just dock you out of the paycheck a minute
3764761 dustin and steve are now in uh the large room the kitchen
3764762 you were at the lockers correct the red lockers over there you were standing and facing the lockers out of your peripheral vision to your left which would be right over here you see a figure moving
3764763 is it is it flat or does it have depth and shape to it
3764764 so if you can explain to me this pass episode that happened
3764765 okay well i guess they were all racked out in the bunkroom they were in bed asleep and they work up to one of these personal alarms going off
3764766 every uniform at the fire station has whats called a pass unit on it
3764767 when they came downstairs they found several of them just blinking and another several of them in full alarm
3764768 in the case of the personal alarm systems i believe its called the pass uh again went into it thinking that i was going to be able to nail that one right on on the dot its an electrical piece of equipment so theres tons of electrical failures that happen after looking into that none of it can be used to debunk it
3764769 dustin and steve upstairs in the uh bedroom thats connected to the the loft area in the kitchen
3764770 ill tell ya man until i see otherwise i stick by my theory thats just stories handed down to razz the probies and they just get kinda caught up in em over the years
3764771 is there anyone here that would like to speak to us we would like a sign of your presence please what was that did you hear that
3764772 yeah i did but i dont know what it was
3764773 so what im lookin for is what kind of frequency this operates on or anything i mean i got the website up
3764774 to that unit there thats in all of the trucks
3764775 so theres a frequency that allows this to send theres gotta be a frequency that allows it to receive
3764776 well thats what im lookin for is a frequency this operates on
3764777 its gonna be the only logical explanation of why all these would go off
3764778 yeah so youre sayin it it even if it wasnt that unit itself as long as it was that same frequency going by
3764779 i im going by the the site even a even a cb radio that only covers 40 channels
3764780 its like your wireless router at home that shuts off when your phone rings
3764781 we got a slight emf fluctuation right next to the couch it was uh the base readings about point 3 to point 7 it went up to about 1 9 was the highest reading
3764782 no it stayed right there right in front of the couch
3764783 what the heck now its holding steady at a 4
3764784 somethins movin like that of course you want to try to track it and uh whatever it was it moved then it came back and the power came back you know grant went down to see about havin somebody research this thing
3764785 some had high spikes but the sound system turned on twice by itself
3764786 yeah i mean it was a small spot but we got some pretty interestin things happen
3764787 im still tryin to understand what the heck that was with the uh that surround sound system turn on by itself
3764788 i cant wait for them to review the evidence and see if anything happened in conjunction with that on the stuff audio video
3764789 we didnt get anything we watched all the video we watched uh the dvs all the high 8 nothing
3764790 is there any way scientifically we could prove or explain that phenomenon with the stereo
3764791 well i think when it comes down to that you know a remote of course works off of a frequency and it you know so it could be somebody driving by using a certain cell phone we cant label the place haunted cause the stereo turned itself on
3764792 so are you linking uh the possibility that what affected the stereo might also be affecting the pass units that they
3764793 well thats something that i want to bring up those units those t pass units well ive talked to uh to paula about it because she works with frequencies all day long and i asked her is there any other device that could operate on that frequency cause we had the frequency from the website and she said certainly
3764794 theres another fire station thats not even a mile and a half down the road
3764795 one of the first things we were interested in was the pass units why did they go off these units have i guess they operate in one of the most busy frequency ranges there is when theres too many devices working on a frequency range they tend to scan they leap frequencies back and forth trying to find something thats open and so itll set the device off
3764796 it doesnt explain why the clips were pulled off the systems and stuff like that so that still makes us sit there and wonder
3764797 now that night um me and grant got a few strange things that happened that night upstairs uh the emf which is electromagnetic frequency uh started rising while that happened the stereo system thats attached to your guys t v the surround system would turn itself on
3764798 normally that emf field would stay in one area but this we could track around the room which is really odd
3764799 and you know all those things it it just makes you sit back and wonder
3764800 the only thing that we didnt experience and couldnt really try and debunk was the shadows that you had seen they couldnt figure it out it wasnt anything like cars going by or anything
3764801 i think when it comes down to it the main thing you guys need to understand is if there is something actually going on here theres no need for your volunteers to fear it at all
3764802 we have experience things here that we cant really explain but we dont have anything that we could give you to show someone say look you know our place is haunted we have proof all we can say is that what youre experiencing you have nothing to fear nothing to worry about
3764803 weve all seen things happen in the station and to have you guys come in and say you know what we cant exactly put our finger on it we have some evidence
3764804 yeah if any of your volunteers at any time really do feel bothered by the place youre more than welcome to have them call us and we can come and talk to em and help em understand
3764805 guys i really appreciate you having us out teds last words
3764806 taps came in and did their investigation and they cant denounce it and they cant prove it they had some odd findings upstairs with uh stereo equipment hasnt happened with me i hope it doesnt happen with me um im glad they came cause i think its going to put a lot of peoples minds at ease with in the station that you know nothing here can hurt us or is going to bother us its just the way the station is now i guess
3764807 yeah i think that they uh feel a little bit more at ease which i wasnt really expecting which is good
3764808 well i think theyre also happy that we didnt come in and say hey you guys are crackpots you know um we had some weird situations that happened that night as well and it kind of makes em feel a little more at ease cause we had our own experiences there
3764809 hes very organized and he just makes the right decisions and it paid off especially in this in this case
3764810 nice to know those firemen are a little more at ease
3764811 the only thing that stays the same is that everything changes
3764812 be joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
3764813 truck is too big you need smaller truck my company no have you ha to call a diffrent company
3764814 the isolation the silence the stillness this is only making me a better person less hurried more flexible more patient
3764815 this petition is full of misstatements about red that the simplest google search would uncover red has raised more than 109 million for the global fund in just two years all of this money goes to aids programs in africa with no overhead or advertising money taken out
3764816 it is the ability and willingness to be led where you would rather not go
3764817 not a leadership of power and control but a leadership of humility in which the suffering servant of god jesus christ is made manifest
3764818 not the way of upward mobility in which our world has invested so much but the way of downward mobility ending on the cross
3764819 just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
3764820 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

3764830 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3764831 im excited to be given the opportunity and to be making the most of it you dont get many chances to do something special like this
3764832 it was a great weekend but i dont want to be labelled just a road course racer i am tenth in the nationwide points im trying to make it as a nascar driver full stop not just a road racer
3764833 i really thought about it and wanted to have a crack at him but i didnt quite have the run up the hill
3764834 i could have tried something risky but the difference between second and third for me was small compared to the negative i would have had if i took out one of these chase guys and got a bad reputation
3764835 i wanted to be respectful of the guys who are doing it week in week out its not my place to stick my nose in and ruin someone elses day thats fighting for the chase
3764836 im really proud of the job theyve done and i hope it can give them the shot in the arm they need to get the momentum to move forward
3764837 theyve had a tough run but i hope i can play my part in helping to get them back on track its good that i could give them a lift but theres a long road ahead
3764838 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3764839 hell yeah boys they keep trying to play these mind games well just keep on winning think about this for a week boys
3764840 it would not be right to talk about these things

3764846 corporations and the investment community are increasingly aware of the economic toll that oil addiction has on businesses and the pocketbooks of millions of americans especially those in states not taking action to curb oil use and encourage the growth of clean technology and adoption of alternative energy policies
3764847 its yellow its ugly it doesnt match anything but it can save lives get equipped now
3764848 no ifs ands or buts young man im coming to get you
3764849 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors unfortunately we have seen in recent days demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
3764850 it really doesnt hurt at all sometimes when i go home at night i might feel a bit of pain but not during the act
3764851 the only time it hurts is when it comes out unplanned like if im bending down to pick up a suitcase and it pops out
3764852 i think it comes out a different way when it does that
3764853 i was always into magic as a young kid and i started mixing with other magicians and performers
3764854 i met a contortionist who really helped me with my show when i discovered i could do all this freaky stuff with my arms
3764855 people generally respond well when they see me throwing my arms over my head or giving a clap with my elbows but i do get the some people who throw up
3764856 sometimes i can get myself out of a sticky situation when im on my own on a train or something and some people are shouting abuse at me because of my odd appearance
3764857 ill just start throwing my shoulders around and they back off and think im cool
3764858 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
3764859 i will continue to humanise even the enemy the first teacher who taught me hebrew was a jew the first love affair in my life was with a jewish girl the first judge who sent me to prison was a jewish woman so from the beginning i didnt see jews as devils or angels but as human beings
3764860 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3764861 he could be the very best road course driver ive ever seen
3764862 it all worked out we came out third so im happy and tickled to death
3764863 i kept watching his lap times and they didnt fall off in a long run like a lot of the cars did
3764864 he stayed consistent and kept the car under him all day we looked at the tires the first stop and at that point i figured it was going to be a pretty good day if everything fell our way from there on out
3764865 anytime you can finish in the top five in this series youre doing your job and certainly itll help us in the future
3764866 i think this is our first top five in a long time
3764867 we ran well last week at pocono and we had a good car at sonoma too sometimes things will fall into place for you
3764868 we came up out of the truck so well we were too scared to change anything and the car was flopping around a lot during the race though it had a lot of grip
3764869 it was just real tough to drive so i just tried to stay clean as best i could there and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it
3764870 i dont want to be labeled a road racer and by the way i am 10th in the nationwide series standings
3764871 i just really want to be respectful to the guys who are doing it week in and week out its not my place to stick my nose in and ruin someone elses day thats fighting for the chase
3764872 if i was going to pass tony i was going to do it clean i really thought about it i wanted to have a crack at it but i just wasnt close enough
3764873 the difference between second and third was small compared to the negative it would have been had i taken out one of these chase guys and gotten a bad reputation
3764874 its just great i can give them a bit of a lift
3764875 ive dragged my family a long way away from friends and family down home
3764876 its just a lot of commitment but when you have a weekend like this it validates the choices ive made
3764877 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3764878 thats the nature of race car drivers to want more
3764879 theres always a quest for more if weve won two races we want to win a third if were leading a race by four car lengths we want to lead by five
3764880 it means a lot to me to be racing at home every race is important i need to play a little catch up
3764881 in order to catch bowyer ive got to make up about 12 points per race
3764882 i know there are going to be ups and downs during the season
3764883 i thought he deserved a chance but i never dreamed it would have been with junior that was five times more than anything i expected
3764884 he has nothing else on his mind these days its like hes got blinders on
3764885 he diets he exercises whatever he needs to do to be a better racer
3764886 i will for certain drive the no 88 nationwide car
3764887 im a more experienced more confident driver than at this time last year ive earned a little more respect from the competition
3764888 you just pick up vibes the garage area is like a neighborhood some guys you dont get along with so great and some you do its just funny how that works out
3764889 the company was with another estimating vendor but was unhappy with level the customer service they were receiving
3764890 they field tested simsol for a period of about two months and were very pleased at the high level of customer and product support they received during the initial pilot period we are very happy they decided to make the move over to simsol and are now part of the growing number of insurance carriers who have made our product the estimating platform of choice for their adjusting staffs

3764905 he has made everything beautiful in its time also he has put eternity in their hearts except that no one can find out the work that god does from beginning to end
3764906 there are eleven songs on the album and they are all original we feel very strongly about writing our own songs not only is song writing a personal creative impulse compulsion which we simply cannot ignore but writing is key in defining the toy hearts sound and we hope it will allow us to make our own mark on the bluegrass genre with its fine heritage of song writing me sophia dad and hannah tend to write as a unit one usually brings the initial idea but we all play a part in the songs completion we always credit the songs johnson johnson johnson our bass player lauren wrote the lyrics for one track on the new album ill keep waiting
3764907 hannah sings all the lead she has worked very hard training her voice and listens incessantly to singers like lefty frizzell hank williams and her current favourite bradley walker the harmonies are all done by me and lauren
3764908 there are no instrumentals on this album we put piccadilly special on the first cd it was named after the piccadilly theatre where dad was working as an actor and musician in west end show jailhouse rock we kept meaning to write one for the new album we started writing creekbluff drive while we were in texas but we never finished it in time to record i guess it turns out hannah and i have a lot of things to say ha ha
3764909 we recorded it at gighouse studios in leamington spa its a lovely studio out in the country with no distractions unless you count the two goats in the field next door we recorded all the instruments live in separation booths along with a guide vocal we then overdubbed the vocals and some solos we wanted to keep as live a feel as possible as we did not have the facility to do so on our last album so we did minimal editing and overdubbing to the live tracks
3764910 we have put the album out on our own label woodville records as we did with our first one you can buy the album at our gigs on our myspace and website website currently under construction grr will be up and running as soon as possible and in most of the independent record shops in our home town of birmingham eg polar bear and jibbering we are currently negotiating for american distribution with genuine recordings austin texas

3764945 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3764946 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

3764984 information we gathered even before the commencement of this exercise show that there are possibilities that names of some teachers will be deleted on the payroll voucher before the next salary payment either because they are not qualified for the duty or they could not be found during the verification exercise
3764985 some teachers have taught for about a year in some schools without being approved by the ministry since the exercise made provision for both approved and non approved teachers it is possible that those not approved will later gain approval
3764986 some teachers are teaching in the secondary schools without having the basic education qualification therefore there is possibility that those teachers will lose their positions in the said schools
3764987 my union is always working in the interest of the teachers there had been too much of accusations of the existence of ghost schools and teachers in school therefore this exercise will help to verify the fact of the allegation

3765042 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region
3765043 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets

3765049 then there were several generations that were not active at all it impresses me how important the work that young people are now doing is
3765050 you walk to a football game and you see them
3765051 i want to change the world but you have to do it one issue at a time
3765052 theres a lot more people going to college these days and we have to ensure were preserving accessibility for everyone
3765053 for far too long we have not had a legitimate place at the table

3765055 i saw what it was like to live in that kind of poverty
3765056 in the 60s student issues were domestic u s involvement in the vietnam war or the civil rights movement now were looking at globalization and our impact on the world
3765057 i think there is more and more the realization that any human problem it is part of our human lives and we have a role to play
3765058 there are a lot of other areas id rather be working on but because this is my responsibility its what ive been doing
3765059 we are a barbaric nation and we are our own worst nightmare

3765062 the tds recording studio will help youth discover their talents give them the ability to produce music and learn a lot about an exciting industry
3765063 technology in the music industry has really given individuals a voice they didnt have before we wanted to help youth throughout the community get their hands on technology tools and use the internet in new ways
3765064 youth are naturally at a time in their lives when they are trying to find their voice in the world
3765065 music recording videography and poetry have become a powerful avenue for engaging youth who have been otherwise alienated from our schools and our community we believe this new digital music studio will help us connect with many youth in the community

3765076 newcastle united midfielder joey barton has admitted a charge of violent conduct and requested a personal hearing
3765077 the charge relates to an incident involving bartons then manchester city team mate ousmane dabo at citys carrington training ground on 1 may 2007
3765078 this season i want to be right at the peak of my game
3765079 because i worked hard i played for the team and yes i contributed in other ways and played quite well people praised some of my performances
3765080 but i wasnt at the peak of my game and thats the aim for this season to play at the best of my ability
3765081 thats something that i have to achieve now and i am under the right coaching staff here to help me do that
3765082 you have to be at your very very best every time you pull on the green and white hoops
3765083 for me its something thats inside me i want to do well as well as i can and i have always had that in me
3765084 it is a very strong squad and its a sign of our intent for the season coming up not just for the under 21s but the seniors as well
3765085 fraizer campbell is a player that the hull fans will know well and he was a massive part of hull getting into the premier league
3765086 the fact he has been around the manchester united squad in pre season shows he is progressing and he showed an excellent attitude when he was involved in the under 21s at the end of last season
3765087 the clear from american express card has absolutely no fees no annual fee no late fees no over limit fees no balance transfer fees no cash advance fees no fees of any kind

3765091 10th annual quality excellence conference how process improvement leaders produce profits in recessions
3765092 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high
3765093 in 1998 and 1999 stocks were really down but the companies then were not really full of assets now the boxes are full
3765094 the construction industry remains soft and a drag on the economy
3765095 but this is not a positive outlook and consequently a net negative 4 percent of all firms seasonally adjusted plan to add to stocks a point better than june but weak
3765096 if the fed is truly through cutting rates this statistic will migrate towards zero or a positive number over the coming months
3765097 apparently owners do not expect the feds easing of interest rates to help
3765098 be patient wait concentrate close your eyes clear your mind itll come
3765099 dino was instrumental in building one of the sports most successful aerodynamics departments which helped the renault f1 team win double drivers and constructors titles in 2005 and 2006
3765100 his contribution to the team both through his results and his courage in the face of illness are an inspiration he will be missed enormously and the immediate thoughts of the whole team are with his family
3765101 we decided unanimously that even with another 24 hours of dry weather we would be in no way fit to race
3765102 the manager has made some great signings i never realised before how good deco really is
3765103 i played against him four or five times in the past and hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
3765104 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
3765105 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realise how determined he is
3765106 the stylistic transitions say a lot about the country and historic era of origin
3765107 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3765108 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3765109 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3765110 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3765111 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3765112 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3765113 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3765114 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3765115 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3765116 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3765117 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3765118 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3765119 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3765120 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3765121 i enjoyed my break and i think i was ready for it at the end of last season
3765122 but like everyone else i am ready for the start of another tough season because the premier league you get the players saying it is the place to be
3765123 obviously if you cant play in it the next best thing is to be a manager in it
3765124 i look forward to the challenge ahead with the expectations slightly higher this year because of the players weve brought in and weve had a year in the premier league
3765125 previously the players had the experience of relegation so the fact weve stayed up this year helps and certainly we want to do better in the league and cup competitions
3765126 i played with him and i know him and he knows me too
3765127 he thinks i have the potential to play for this club i used to play for bolton where i did good things now i forget everything about bolton forget because i start with a new team here and want to be a legend over there
3765128 i love it when people talk about respect and what people think about me i never did a bad thing with the referee
3765129 the olympic games are only once every four years and youve got to do what you can
3765130 and i did that but ive never pushed through pain like that before if it had been any competition other than the olympics i would have withdrawn
3765131 at one point before we came out here michaela did say to me i dont know if i can do this i dont know if i can do the clean and jerk
3765132 i was under no illusions it was going to be an easy competition and position was kind of irrelevant
3765133 if id come out for my last snatch i probably wouldnt have been able to make it through the clean and jerk the pain has really limited my ability to clean and jerk in training so that was really just a case of saving something
3765134 ive gone through a whole rollercoaster of thinking i wasnt going to go then getting a place then getting the problem with my back so im disappointed but chuffed at the same time now id like to defend my commonwealth title in 2010 and then aim for london 2012
3765135 ive got funding at the moment but i might not have after this
3765136 americans who must live with the consequences will continue to suffer higher taxes lower quality of life higher threat and fear levels and less actual safety
3765137 compared with 1990 there were actually 700 000 fewer non hispanic whites in poverty last year meanwhile the number of poor hispanics is up by 3 million since 1990 the health insurance story is similar last year 13 million hispanics lacked insurance theyre 60 percent of the rise since 1990
3765138 much like anyone else in the population immigrants use services that are costly to provide or that others can use less freely so called congestion costs examples include services from roads sewers police and fire departments libraries airports and foreign embassies
3765139 they allow the secretary of state to remove a case from a jury on the vague ground that it is in the public interest the whole thing is an appalling violation of the separation of powers
3765140 the government has so far failed to make the case for handing it the power to appoint the coroner disband the jury and hold inquests in secret
3765141 hopefully it will prevent the brownouts and the blackouts if we are serious about our planet this is just one small way that you can contribute
3765142 having the doors open increases business it does wonders for us i feel like they should find a between solution to the energy crisis
3765143 the only group that should be opposing this sensible legislation is opec
3765144 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3765145 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace
3765146 we know that nationally there is increasing public concern about knives getting into the hands of youngsters
3765147 we want residents in knowsley to know that working in partnership with merseyside police we are doing all we can to stop it happening here
3765148 retailers need to know that we will not tolerate any outlets selling what are essentially lethal weapons to our young people and our officers will use the full weight of the law to take action against those who flout it
3765149 equally we realise that some people need support and education around this area of the law if you are a retailer and feel you could benefit from further advice please do not hesitate to contact our environmental health and consumer protection team on 0151 443 4713
3765150 we are committed to tackling knife crime on merseyside working with our partners we want to stamp out this problem and get knives off our streets
3765151 one strand of our joint approach is test purchasing operations such as this and we hope they send a clear message to retailers that we will take action against those who break the law
3765152 data in the u s is far from stellar and the perception isthat the slowdown here is bottoming while real problems arejust about to start in places like europe

3765167 his courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues

3765192 it is important to note that the hedging loss for the quarter was non cash and does not necessarily reflect the expected future cash settlement value of the contracts
3765193 as of june 30 the oil hedged represents less than one third of enterras oil production and therefore any actual cash cost of these hedges will be more than offset by higher prices received on the non hedged production

3765347 researchers for instance have known that the leg extension machine the unit in which you sit with your shin behind a padded bar attached to a weight stack and then straighten your leg in front of you trains you to do just one thing become very strong at the leg extension machine
3765348 in one of the few studies on this subject researchers from the university of kentucky studied 23 patients with knee pain to see what made them stronger a step up test or doing leg extensions while they found that both groups eventually became stronger at doing leg extensions only the group doing the step up test actually became stronger at stepping up and doing functional activities the reason the seated leg extension machine has nothing to do with how we use our legs which are meant to hold us upright against gravity while we walk climb or descend
3765349 the leg extension machine puts a lot of strain on the knee ligaments and the patella
3765350 boomer get your butt off that dangerous and evil leg extension machine your really gonna hurt your patella doing that now go on over there and snatch that barbell over your head as fast and as explosively as possible 50 times and then get out on the field and ram your cervical spine into the blocking posts till you drop
3765351 theres no doubt that joness invention brought resistance training to the masses but his claim that he created a
3765352 the fact remains however that they are an incredibly inferior exercise to the more compound and functional movements such as squats or lunges
3765353 for most people most of the time leg extensions are not advisable because they isolate the quadriceps without a synergistic contraction from the posterior muscles such as glute max and hamstring
3765354 no exercise is completely without merit but i would question giving someone who is interested in general conditioning fat loss athletic conditioning or general stregth there are more functional useful applicable exercises that one can be doing
3765355 there are more functional useful applicable exercises that one can be doing
3765356 moving a weight in isolation on a fixed machine that the lifter has to conform to is counterintuitive to natural human movement
3765357 someone training for fat loss should endeavor to increase lbm as much as possible to increase metabolic rate so if adding le could potentially hypertrophy the quads more then yes i would perform it
3765358 someone training for general strength conditioning is most likely concerned with increasing strength if performing le increases the strength of quads then yes i would perform it
3765359 someone training for athletic conditioning as long as we are considering athletics that involve the legs is concerned with improving function should increase the strength of their legs and then apply that newly acquired strength to their specific sport by practicing so yes if the le exercise can increase the strength of the leg then i would perform it not to mention some sports would directly benefit from specifically developing the quads soccer tae kwan do to name a couple
3765360 if an exercise is performed resulting in hypertrophy then that hypertrophied muscle is more capable of producing force increased functionability so then any exercise which results in hypertrophy including le is functional if you apply that strength to any activity it has just become useful or applicable so your argument is completely without merit
3765361 relatively few exercises machines or free weight are natural human movement squats for instance i have never naturally loaded a weight on my shoulders and sqautted when i lift something heavy naturally i am free to lean and leverage differently when squatting in the gym i have to conform to the exercise movement or fall backwards or injure myself we all conform or fight against biomechanics of human muscle movement some exercise are better than others biomechanically assuming we are referring only to exercises that are congruent with the biomechanics then machine or not isolation or compound isnt it natural to move the muscles the way they are designed to move
3765362 im not sure why you would refer to this discussion nonsensical
3765363 you make an erroneous assumption that hypertrophy is directly related to force production which is directly related to functionality yes you can hypertrophy the quad muscles but there wont be much if anything in the way of carry over strength and therefore athleticism or functionality
3765364 do you agree then that for building strength athletic ability functionality fat burning etc that compund movements such as squats are better than isolation movements such as les
3765365 im not sure why you would go to so much trouble trying to make up reasons why my contentions are invalid
3765366 for the record the primary leg exercises performed by the people i train are squats deadlifts sldl leg press i am not arguing their benefit or place in a routine however i also include hip ab ad le lc hip extension when appropriate
3765367 if goal is to fully develop the quads especially vastus medialis good luck without the le machine

3765385 they told me they were going to kill me unless i stopped preaching my mystic gospel
3765386 god is the greatest and i didnt come to die on death row
3765387 theyre trying to silence me because i know about the satanic secret societies of the tdc shadow government e system
3765388 it makes no sense for the state to keep someone on death row under severe conditions when hes been recognized as severely ill
3765389 what the factor is is that riles was competent when he was tried and given a legal sentence his confinement is still legal and he simply has a condition right now that makes him not eligible for execution but that could change
3765390 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3765392 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3765393 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3765394 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3765395 the hell with this i have better things to do with my time
3765396 youre 37 you should have a house you should be making x amount of dollars per year you should be here

3765401 the us is like its own little world if you dont get the opportunity to get out you dont even realise youre missing an entire world of other things other cultures other things going on outside of the america box
3765402 i had to venture to music outside of what you can get here in the states to see what is going on thats where
3765403 i saw how big dance music is in the uk and i decided to do my version of a dance track i cant do a straight dance track thats not really my thing but thats my version of a dance r amp b track
3765404 a guitar by itself doesnt need to be synthesised out
3765405 stargate have shown the sound of an acoustic guitar or piano is beautiful and it works
3765406 youre not going to buy this record because of who i did a feature with youre going to get it because youre a ne yo fan
3765407 i dont want to be able to blame anyone else if for any reason god forbid this album doesnt do what i expect it to do
3765408 i honestly prefer when someone comes to me and says i see the moment you made for beyonce now make me a moment not remake the beyonce moment for me
3765409 when you think lindsay lohan you dont think singer lets be honest no one does
3765410 so i made an assumption on what i thought the record was gonna be when it was done and i was absolutely wrong i can stand here as a man and admit i was absolutely wrong i publicly apologised on television i stood up and said lindsay lohan is actually a pretty good singer the record came out great we might so some more work with her
3765411 michael jackson is one of the reasons why i sing when we met he was really cool people he was really regular people everyone expects michael jackson to be this weird guy and hes not he had a regular suit on there was nothing weird about him we talked about music where he wanted to go direction wise how wed get the records to one another it was a very calm regular meeting
3765412 were trying to get people to ignore the rumours about his personal life and get back to the reason why we loved michael jackson in the first place the entertainment value
3765413 we want to get the music right hes still dancing doing his thing it should be good
3765414 i heard rumours i was drunk driving with a gun in the car none of that was true it goes to show if they dont know theyll make it up
3765415 when it initially happened i was upset and mad it was my first taste of the drama that comes with being in the public eye i didnt fly off the handle like i wanted to and go on national tv and scream im not gay like i wanted to but it is what it is when they stop talking about you whatsoever thats when you should start to worry
3765416 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
3765417 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
3765418 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
3765419 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
3765420 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
3765421 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
3765422 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
3765423 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
3765424 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the
3765425 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
3765426 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
3765427 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
3765428 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
3765429 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not t he opposite of heat sir j ust the absence of it
3765430 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
3765431 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
3765432 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
3765433 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
3765434 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
3765435 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
3765436 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
3765437 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavour are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
3765438 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
3765439 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
3765440 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how c an we trust your lectures sir
3765441 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
3765442 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil

3765447 there was a 2 minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
3765448 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
3765449 i have no way to know it possibly could be possibly not
3765450 i told her alicia they tried to break your focus you let them do that never let them do that we work on that
3765451 in my opinion it was an attempt to break concentration thats exactly what happened
3765452 unfortunately she is the type of gymnast who is very emotional

3765477 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3765478 sarah was only 15 when she had a secret abortion
3765479 had someone in her family known about the abortion sarahs life could have been saved
3765480 courts have recognized that in ballot arguments proponents are allowed to engage in hyperbole
3765481 its absolutely false to say if someone had known about it her life would be saved
3765482 well meaning but misguided effort s to force minors to notify their parents before seeking an abortion
3765483 make their tragic circumstance worse by giving them two choices one worse than the other
3765484 navigating the courts scares the bejabbers out of most adults let alone frightened teenagers
3765485 trying to deal with a pregnancy could quickly be mired in a child abuse investigation involving the parents she was afraid to talk to in the first place
3765486 need for this kind of law in california is widely exaggerated
3765487 reducing the number of teenage abortions is an excellent goal
3765488 the way to make that happen is through education and effective contraception not by preying on the most troubled of pregnant teens to make a political point
3765489 is this world a bit crazy or is it just me
3765490 this is the way things are and this is they way things shall ever be for one and for all
3765491 said they are dissatisfied with the pace of rebuilding and recovery
3765492 vast majority remain optimistic and hopeful about the citys future
3765493 thats a sentiment officials should capitalize on by doing everything they can to speed up the recovery
3765494 city residents may have high expectations about the rebuilding process being able to correct deep seated problems in our area
3765495 such an engaged hopeful constituency that is eager to correct long standing problems is a gift that elected officials and community leaders ought not to waste
3765496 officials need to make sure the recovery shows substantial progress soon and they need to push decisively for further reforms to make government more efficient and improve the citys quality of life
3765497 pace of recovery is slowing in new orleans as the city approaches the third anniversary of hurricane katrina
3765498 m lange of federal state city and private recovery efforts under way it is difficult to grasp what is really happening in the stricken city
3765499 the good news is that six in 10 katrina survivors say that their lives are almost or largely back to normal and most see recovery moving in the right direction
3765500 bad news is that four in 10 respondents say their lives are still disrupted
3765501 smaller majorities see little or no progress in making medical services available
3765502 what is worrisome is that half of the residents are dissatisfied with or angry about the lack of progress most think it is a bad time for children to grow up in new orleans and 22 predominantly young are seriously considering moving away
3765503 unless government agencies and private organizations pick up the pace of recovery efforts new orleans may see its future pack up and go with them

3765516 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3765517 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3765518 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3765519 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3765520 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3765521 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3765522 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3765525 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3765526 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3765527 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3765528 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3765529 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3765530 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3765531 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3765532 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist

3765555 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3765556 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3765557 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3765558 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3765559 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3765560 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3765561 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple

3765570 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3765571 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3765572 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3765573 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3765574 it is very important now that all parties cease fire

3765591 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3765592 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3765593 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
3765594 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
3765595 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3765596 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3765597 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology
3765598 una parte significativa de escuelas muy peque as con organizaci n multigrado que carecen todav a de equipo inform tico
3765599 a estas alturas tener computadoras sin conexi n no sirve demasiado ya que una de las potencialidades que ellas brindan es la conectividad que permite vincularse con otros y lograr una diferencia cualitativa es esto lo que tiene impacto en el proceso educativo
3765600 la gran posibilidad de internet es la colaboraci n en el aprendizaje entendiendo que el conocimiento se construye con otros como fuente de informaci n es una especie de biblioteca pero con un acceso m s r pido esta din mica es innovadora para la escuela
3765601 el problema no es tanto la cantidad de alumnos por computadora sino la conectividad que es lo que permite que el docente se conecte baje informaci n actualizada y transforme la explicaci n en el sal n de clase la pregunta sustantiva es c mo se resuelve la conexi n
3765602 no tenemos los recursos econ micos para pagar ese servicio
3765603 estamos gestionando con buenos aires la provisi n de equipos
3765604 en algunos lugares hay mucho y en otros no hay nada lo que queda claro es que hay una profunda heterogeneidad
3765605 para ellas no es un gasto grande y abre puertas incre bles en peque as comunidades en la ciudad no nos damos cuenta lo importante que es el acceso a internet
3765606 no tiene sentido equipar las escuelas si no hay una l nea de trabajo con los docentes para que medien entre las tecnolog as y los alumnos
3765607 debe disociarse la idea de que con m s computadoras mejora la calidad es el docente el que con una o con 15 ense a el buen uso poder utilizarla para amplificar nuestras capacidades cognitivas y superarnos all el trabajo del docente es fundamental

3765612 recruiting is going good i have offers from south carolina ole miss south florida middle tennessee state marshall uab and purdue
3765613 i would say south carolina ole miss purdue and marshall are recruiting me the hardest right now everyone is recruiting me to play wr
3765614 i talk to all the coaches at ole miss they tell me im the number one wr on their board i have spoken with coach austin coach dickerson coach nutt and coach vaughn they want me to play wr rb and return kicks on special teams i know that i will visit ole miss after my season for sure the ole miss coaches treat me like ole miss is my home already i also talk to the coaches at south carolina a lot coach spurrier likes to throw the ball around so that caught my attention i went to their spring game and really enjoyed myself im very interested in south carolina
3765615 i think ill make a decision towards the end of the season if the time is right and i find the place that fits me perfectly then ill commit but im planning on waiting until the end of the season right now i dont have a leader all of the schools who have offered have an equal chance
3765616 despite the global recessionary trends mounting inflation and prospects of elections in the near future privately held businesses phbs in india have shown the highest level of optimism about their prospects for next year

3765619 economic growth is expected to ease back in the coming quarters and years
3765620 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3765621 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy

3765638 late bloomers cezanne is his archetype who did his most valuable work in his fifties and sixties are what he calls experimental artists these are people who are motivated by aesthetic considerations their goals are kind of very very imprecise they dont plan anything in advance they work sort of by trial and error they do endless iterations of the same idea theyre constantly redoing and redoing and redoing in this kind of poking around and trying to find something work toward some kind of distant imprecise and badly understood goal theyre searching in other words for what it is they want to create and that searching can very often take an entire lifetime
3765639 prodigies picasso is the archetype here who was basically done by his mid thirties on the other hand tend to be much more motivated by the desire according to galenson to communicate ideas theyre conceptual in the way that they think they can state their goals very precisely before they start a work of art the act of painting for them is all about the act of transferring something some well realized idea from one surface to another the work of experimentalists like cezanne often kind of complicates and deepens our understanding of something but conceptualists people like picasso tend to simplify the field that theyre a part of they work very quickly and systematically
3765640 through this blog i aim to bring the tidbits of news from the beat that wouldnt otherwise be reported or the behind the scenes observations that could only be made with a press credential i have a not so hidden agenda too i believe life has a soundtrack and plan on mixing my love of music in with my posts sometimes that will come in the form of paraphrasing lyrics to songs i e the intro to this post and sometimes it will just be linked
3765641 who choose to abort an unwanted pregnancy may experience feelings of grief and loss but there is no evidence that a single abortion causes significant mental health problems

3765649 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3765650 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3765651 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3765652 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3765653 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3765654 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3765655 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3765656 you do not do evil to those who do evil to you but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness
3765657 the infineon raceway is a great course to learn on because its not what they call like a horsepower course
3765658 its more of a technical course in that you have to learn about taking a wide radius on the turns and the apexes of your turn which is what ive been learning today
3765659 firstly you know as youngsters you know as the cheetah girls these three women they represent the youth and children as being vulnerable you know eight to 14 years

3765661 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3765662 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3765663 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3765664 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3765665 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3765666 such responses are alarming especially considering that those drivers health and well being could be at stake
3765667 if a vehicles engine has serious problems it could break down and strand the driver along the road thats something that no parent ever wants to see happen to their son or daughter
3765668 thats why a device like carmd can be so handy it can help the student check for hidden problems before starting a road trip as well as answer check engine light questions that gives parents peace of mind
3765669 even if the problem turns out to be something as simple as a loose gas cap people dont seem to realize that gas mileage is affected
3765670 with gas prices around 4 00 a gallon right now thats a major concern for cost conscious students and their parents

3765735 both as a councillor and as a member of parliament john macdougall embodied the best traditions of public service
3765736 his courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
3765737 john was somebody who was committed to the people of fife who spent many years in public service

3765751 i wasnt a racist although people around me were racists and justifiably so but i didnt care about them it was wrong for me not to be a racist all these years it was pure selfishness on my behalf not to be a racist just because it didnt touch me personally but now i understand the importance of having an ethical attitude imagine what would happen if everybody behaved as selfishly as i did if everybody failed to be a racist where would israel be then

3765756 well because for architects and students brasilia holds out a lot of unanswered questions it was showered with criticism when it was inaugurated as a monument to modernity and we think the best way to form our own opinions is to see it for ourselves not just look at photographs
3765757 four of us have graduated and the other three have only a few exams to go
3765758 seeing brasilia was the key motivation because its an emblematic city for architects but the idea took on a life of its own and we are also going to visit historic towns mining towns jesuit ruins and so on
3765759 we know that we wont be seeing latin american architecture but only a section of the region where we will investigate the marked contrasts that exist within some large cities and between big cities and small towns some of which are practically unknown outside their local areas
3765760 we are very keen to meet him and we really hope it will be possible
3765761 we think rather that there are shared characteristics such as when architects make use of local materials in their work in any case that is what we want to find out

3765773 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3765774 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive

3765821 piper jaffray analyst gene munster has upped his estimate of the number of iphones he expects apple to sell in its 4th quarter from 4 1 million to 4 47 million according to a report to clients issued early wednesday
3765822 munster s new estimate is based 1 on apple s report that it sold 1 million iphone 3gs in the three days following the device s july 11 launch and 2 on 25 hours of in store checks across the united states conducted over the past two weeks
3765823 on tuesday fortune com reported on the findings of an independent analyst michael cote of the cote collaborative who estimates that 3 million units were purchased worldwide during the iphone 3g s first 30 days on the market
3765824 iphone 3g users in australia and around the world are suffering from slow internet speeds and poor reception because of a flaw in the device that may have been fixed if not for apples immense culture of secrecy
3765825 a source at an australian telco who did not wish to be named said apple paranoid about keeping the device under wraps only provided the iphone 3g to carriers the day before it went to market leaving them with no time to test it thoroughly on their networks
3765826 users in australia europe and the us have flooded online forums including apples own discussion boards with complaints of poor reception slow internet speeds and dropped calls
3765827 the poor reception often displayed as one bar and slow speeds are occurring in areas of good coverage and do not seem to affect other phones
3765828 jessica forrest vodafone australias spokeswoman said the iphone 3g issues were device specific and nothing to do with the carriers networks
3765829 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution she said declining to elaborate
3765830 in the netherlands t mobile also blamed the iphone 3gs reception issues on apple
3765831 on a company blog it said the problem was a

3765833 just a few days after the isle of man tt i got a call from michael looking to see if he could get a run out on the suzuki 1000 superstock at skerries
3765834 we are now preparing the big bike for the ulster grand prix where michael is well capable of finishing in the top 10 of the super stock race
3765835 however michael would think he would be in the top five
3765836 he is a bit like his dad robert would have said second is for losers and michael would generally think along those lines as well
3765837 i knew the bikes were really well tuned this year and that was proved with daniel sayle finished runners up in the tt
3765838 it is good working with michael again the communication is good and he is happy with the set up
3765839 the meeting was called because residents wanted to look at ways of stopping youths hanging around this particular area
3765840 it is mainly pensioners that live in the houses next to the pathway and they have been tortured by young people who use the laneway for drinking and so on
3765841 we suggested to the housing executive a number of ways this issue could be addressed including the removal of a fence around the executive land so that the area is more open and visible and the possible erection of gates so that only nearby residents can access the pathway
3765842 something needs to be done because people living here are fed up with the situation
3765843 the housing executive met with residents to discuss concerns regarding anti social behaviour
3765844 at the meeting the housing executive agreed a number of actions with residents to help improve the situation

3765851 i am reminding people that these are motors they are driving
3765852 i have sympathy for young people who are using them but we still have a problem with young people on the roads with quads
3765853 i have cycled on the towpath and it is too narrow for cycling and walking
3765854 i am asking cyclists to be mindful of their own safety and that of pedestrians
3765855 but people have to show a wee bit of respect for cyclists too
3765856 we have been working closely with five community groups across the southern region of councils to help them reduce their ecological footprint

3765905 russian policy as uniquely destructive in generating instability and political division in the caucasus
3765906 georgias role in maintaining the only east west pipeline route free of russias monopolistic grip
3765907 the war in georgia is a war for the west
3765908 waging all out war on my country thats not of georgias making nor its choice the kremlin designed this war its a war about georgias independence and future and about the future of freedom in europe

3765974 a gush katif museum will be opened in central jerusalem to preserve the history of the settlement and the crime of its destruction for future generations
3765975 we hope visitors will come in smiling and leave with tears in their eyes
3765976 the entrance is free it is a mitzvah so the public will learn what really happened
3765977 most israelis are under the assumption that the gush katif settlement included only a few caravans but the truth is that peoples homes and lives were destroyed
3765978 the biggest challenges district 22 faces are what our entire state is facing cuts in education funding a slowing economy a looming health care crisis and an environment that needs continuous attention and protection

3765981 i favor increased transparency and accountability of any such school and i wish that the recent move to expand the program had included more meaningful accountability measures
3765982 health care concerns loom large in this district many constituents have difficulties paying for insurance especially those who are self employed or work for small businesses others have deductibles so high they are omitting yearly screening tests young adults especially recent college graduates are not finding jobs with benefits another issue is the high property tax rate with many aging residents fearing they cannot afford to live in their homes

3765992 after years of opposition to nuclear energy it appears gov jim doyle became the first democrat to abandon barack obamas no policy as americans continue to struggle with high energy prices
3765993 now willing to lift the nuclear moratorium doyles stance is more in line with senator john mccain who has called for 45 new nuclear power plants in the united states by 2030 we support doyles willingness to follow mccains leadership as he listens to wisconsinites in need of a solution to our energy crisis
3765994 its good to see senator mccains message of expanding the use of nuclear power is resonating in wisconsin
3765995 modify wisconsins current moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants to allow this option to be considered in the future
3765996 i dont know why politicians like to propose things that are going to cost their constituents money
3765997 all of the nuclear recommendations could only take place if we invest in energy efficiency as recommended by the task force and if wisconsin implements stronger requirements for renewable energy
3765998 one is that there are two steps that you can take right now that are more effective really positive steps those steps are energy efficiency and conservation and then moving toward a renewable homegrown energy portfolio
3765999 there are many steps that will require some sort of approval so its a question of how to package it and move it all for ward

3766002 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators mugabe and mutambara have agreed
3766003 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3766004 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people

3766019 this should be the normal place where prejudice no longer reigns supremely
3766020 the prominence of a number of european and north american conventions has resulted in an increasing influence of positions contrary to the new testament and to baptist doctrines
3766021 a decided anti american tone has emerged in recent years
3766022 continued emphasis on women as pastors frequent criticisms of the international mission board of southern baptists refusal to allow open discussion of issues such as abortion and the funding of questionable enterprises through baptist world aid provide just a surface sampling of what has transpired in recent years
3766023 nowhere in any of our conversations with the bwa has such an excuse ever been given
3766024 that is when the issue arose and is the substance of their action though they have consistently sought to cover it with patently untrue excuses such as that the bwa is anti american
3766025 when children step out in the world they have to deal with different faiths and religions its a good way for teachers to educate students as long as no one is proselytizing or pushing it down someones throat
3766026 penalizing christian students for expressing their beliefs in the classroom is unacceptable under the constitution
3766027 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3766028 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community
3766029 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humour would come from
3766030 hero is honored to be selected for what is sure to be an amazing addition to the bill everett legacy
3766031 had everett worked for ec comics in the 1950s and not marvel comics he would be recognized as the top horror artist of the decade and this new book will prove that assertion
3766032 my brothers and i are grateful and delighted that our fathers talent is being celebrated in this new work by blake bell bill everetts life work centered in the golden age of comics is a treasure that were pleased can be shared with the rest of the art world
3766033 everett is highly respected among the cognoscenti but little known outside those circles everett was a stylistic virtuoso with a rich textured tactile inking technique and we hope that blakes fire and water will do for everett what his book on ditko did for that artist give the artist his critical due while spreading an appreciation to a larger audience

3766069 in your opinion are employees more or less competitive with their coworkers than they were 10 years ago
3766070 in an uncertain economy people grow more concerned about job security and proving their worth to employers
3766071 this pressure to perform may result in rivalries between employees a bit of healthy competition among staff can increase motivation and productivity but just as in sports the overall results of the team are what count too much intramural competition creates tension and stands in the way of collaboration

3766093 i get a lump in my throat when i see such enthusiasm from the fans everyone has shown the olympic spirit with people from all over the globe coming to watch the games and participating in the party atmosphere around the grounds the olympic spirit is alive and pitching at fengtai field
3766094 with the support that comes from my immediate circle for women being involved in sport we see softball as a game with contact and coordination as a natural thing for the caribbean region
3766095 here in beijing i hadnt been able to get to this venue since its completion but in the lead up to the games in the preparative years i visited the stadium and it looks like a wonderful facility i would encourage all my colleagues to come out and see because the exclusion of softball from london 2012 is going to be reviewed and i wouldnt be surprised to see it back with us for 2016
3766096 i would love to see softball come back into the olympics its a sport played all over the world from asia to the americas to europe and you can see from how packed the stadium is that it means a lot to the olympics the atmosphere has been great because softball brings people together
3766097 ive come all the way to china just to see the softball tournament because it wont be at the london olympics and i really hope i get another chance in years to come its a clean sport that is so popular and i know everyone in the stadium and back in canada is praying it gets reinstated
3766098 softball has become very popular in china and it will continue to rise in popularity especially if we can contest olympic medals again the olympics definitely gives the sport a bigger profile and ive seen today how the sport can cultivate the emotions in a special way
3766099 if we could have a mixed version of the game at the olympics along with the womens fast pitch it would be something you dont see in many team sports at the olympics and that would be great looking at the crowds here today shows how everyone gets involved and how entertaining it all is
3766100 i play for a team in the greater london mixed softball league and my team and others were all gutted when softball was taken off the programme for our home olympic tournament the sport is growing at such a fast rate because its fun easily played by all age groups and is always played in the right spirit

3766104 kids first what kids want grown ups to know about separation and divorce
3766105 kids first is an honest and practical guide to providing emotional and physical well being to children whose world is rocked by divorce this book is preventative medicine for all divorcing parents
3766106 i want to give a copy of kids first to each and every one of my clients it will surely help lower inter parental conflict and make life better for children affected by this issue
3766107 adults who take the time to read this book will gain useful information insight and resources to help the children in their lives deal with divorce
3766108 when i was in university i heard the story of the monk who was in prison for 33 years and survived torture and atrocities
3766109 his story stayed with me for such a long time
3766110 what moved me first was the tibetan peoples determination how they carry themselves how proud they are of their country and culture
3766111 usually i like to watch the olympics but i wont watch these
3766112 it really has reached the point where there is a big contradiction between sentiment in the exile community and the policies and actions of the dalai lama
3766113 the ability to venerate the dalai lama but not to accept his policies thats been there for a long time
3766114 but whether its 1 000 2 000 3 000 i dont think anybody has first of all adequate information to begin to put a shape on that
3766115 and the jailers the entire security establishment are very angry at the protesters
3766116 and at least anecdotally we are seeing lots of references very few detailed accounts but references to severe beatings and uses of electric batons
3766117 the seeds are really sown here for what in the future could become an even larger and more serious confrontation
3766118 and none of the measures the chinese are taking none of them are likely to mitigate this
3766119 while senator mccain may believe that the small reduction in the trade deficit represents great progress in an economy he thinks is doing just fine barack obama believes that america can do better than a 693 billion trade deficit over the last year we cannot afford another four years of the massive trade deficits weve had under president bush trade deficits that senator mccains economic policies would only make worse instead we need to change our economic policies by investing in education new energy jobs and technology so that we can strengthen the productivity of our workers and businesses by enforcing our existing trade agreements and negotiating better trade agreements and by reducing record budget deficits and raising low savings rates so that america does not have to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars annually from abroad
3766120 only by addressing these barriers will we get people to recycle more things more often
3766121 good communication about their recycling service is vital but it will not persuade people to use services which are unreliable or too complicated
3766122 we believe this research will help local authorities boost their own recycling rates and to build on their existing successes wrap will continue to support local authorities in achieving this
3766123 if i say i am not going to succeed im a loser then thats what i am going to be
3766124 if we say were kings and we say were queens thats what were going to be it has nothing to do with being arrogant
3766125 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years

3766133 it wouldnt be the olympics if there werent some nervous moments
3766134 one thing weve kept as our team motto is if one persons not doing it the other persons got to do it
3766135 well go in there a little more fired up a little bit sharper half the team this is their first olympic games so coming off two wins and a big one like this i think its going to help the team a lot and give it that extra confidence

3766215 leach chafee and hauser cited the presidential hopefuls approach to foreign policy and to the economy as reasons for supporting him over mccain saying the arizona senator would continue bush administration policies from the war in iraq to an unwillingness to engage enemies in direct diplomacy that have hurt americas standing in the world and its financial stability chafee said weve seen our credibility shattered over the last eight years added leach the prospect that well have more of the same that is the source of angst of many republicans around the country
3766216 hauser is a new york philanthropist who was a financial backer for bush in 2000 and served as a white house intelligence adviser but then endorsed democrat john kerry in 2004 owing to her opposition to the iraq war
3766217 partly what is going on is that in recent years the congressional republicans in general and sen john mccain in particular have so alienated so many conservatives that some of these conservatives are like a drowning man grasping at a straw
3766218 despite the recent set back resulting from the liquidation of a significant portion of the companys corn hedges the start up of commercial operations of our two plants in late june represents significant milestones for our company we are currently focused on the commissioning process and getting the plants to operate at nameplate capacity with limited operational history we remain optimistic that we will meet our nameplate production and operating efficiency metrics while the ethanol sector operating margins have continued to be at historically low levels we remain convinced of the important role ethanol will play in our countrys supply of vehicle fuel

3766227 theyre deciding on paternity leave but nobody in australia really knows what effect it may have if dads stay home with their children
3766228 we need to bring fathers into the discussion but the research isnt there
3766229 the chances are that we are using a lot of energy and taxpayers money throwing money at problems without being able to address them effectively
3766230 we know that fathers have an effect on literacy and breastfeeding rates but usually the lactation consultants only talk to the mums
3766231 we need to define clearly the notion of fatherhood and understand its relationship to motherhood
3766232 the debate has been largely framed from the mothers perspective either from a traditional standpoint that its womens work or from a feminist standpoint that its definitely womens work
3766233 the whole area of male role models fatherhood male involvement in childrearing has never been sufficiently investigated and needs attention

3766235 theres two main things that will assist in saving peoples lives the first is having an adequate amount of fire alarms and the other is that everyone knows the way out in darkness and confusion

3766237 we also recommend that they be wired into the main electrical system and all are inter connected so alarms go off at the same time so you know there is a problem in the home

3766286 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not
3766287 there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help
3766288 when its so hard to reach these kids why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference
3766289 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
3766290 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
3766291 its a sad thing but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids
3766292 those predators are going to be there but most of the time there are warning signs and thats what we need to be working on getting those people out not stopping teachers who havent caused problems from reaching those who need help most

3766301 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3766302 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3766303 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3766304 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon

3766312 it affects me because this is a man who is supposed to be representing the youth as a whole but neither i nor my peers would kill someone for anyone
3766313 the partnership represents an incredible opportunity for ctv in that it significantly offsets our operational costs and so helps us to get the channel up and running
3766314 it is a mutually beneficial partnership that gives us access to facilities while afda students gain hands on experience in television production we commend afdas management on their vision and initiative in engaging with ctv in this manner it shows openness innovative thinking and generosity that we really appreciate
3766315 afda is always looking for opportunities to provide students with situational training and opportunities to exhibit and broadcast their work
3766316 the partnership with ctv will bring enormous benefits to afda in terms of situational training giving our students the opportunity to participate in the activities of a real tv station it is also a very privileged position to watch a tv station being established and to see how it develops over the years to come students can gain insight into how they too can develop things for themselves from small beginnings
3766317 the relationship reflects our commitment to working with training providers in cape town this positions ctv as an interface between the formal education institutions and the video industry by providing emerging film makers with a development ground at the same time the relationship wont affect ctvs independence and accountability to the cape town community and we will still engage with other training institutions
3766318 they therefore warned israel against attacking saying such a strike would undermine american interests they also demanded that israel give them prior notice if it nevertheless decided to strike iran
3766319 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations
3766320 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3766321 if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
3766322 its up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage
3766323 response to threats coming from the u s and israel
3766324 the issue is whether the politicians have time to think about it and to give an order
3766325 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3766326 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3766327 it was deemed that it was pretty unlikely that it would fix it that it would reoccur and if it did there was a chance he hurts it worse and its a much more involved surgery
3766328 i dont think the guys ahead of us would have thought to do that
3766329 we know that theres a problem we have 2 8 million to deal with this problem and we cant use it because people arent applying
3766330 have some side benefits of getting a lead safe apartment but oftentimes they dont understand or they dont really care
3766331 there have been very few enforcement actions around the state so landlords generally disregard the issue to a large degree
3766332 to have someone pay to have most of the work done and reduce their liability
3766333 i think its a matter of more awareness rather than more violence
3766334 its no surprise that those situations would have encouraged more people to reach out for services
3766335 we have to find out how more men can become allies and address other mens behavior
3766336 dont get enough credit for how mature they can be
3766337 the young men i talk with do have a lot of questions
3766338 ive come to be much more aware of male privilege and dominance in our society
3766339 that sort of fits into the big space between something like internet librarian and something like code4lib
3766340 the members of this team are well known in the womens football world over the years they have built a reputation as founding players and stayed true to the sport for nearly a decade we are very pleased to welcome them into the iwfl family

3766346 the number of visitors we are welcoming to our city is increasing year on year the message that birmingham is a great place to visit is certainly spreading

3766370 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
3766371 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3766372 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3766373 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3766374 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
3766375 throughout the globe heat is continually produced in a layer far below the earth s crust large power plants can capture and use this steam to provide electricity on a fairly large scale
3766376 in iceland by some estimates 50 of all energy needs are met through an alternative energy source that has been known for a long time
3766377 geothermal is used in many other places as well the largest system in operation is in california just north of san francisco in an area known as the geysers
3766378 efforts are also underway to use geothermal heat via hot dry rock technology rocks are broken up by pumping water through them at high pressure water is then pumped through the broken rocks so that it can be heated by the earth s energy
3766379 finally geothermal energy also can be tapped through ground source heat pumps effective in heating and cooling individual buildings this approach takes advantage of the fact that just five to 10 feet below the ground there is a constant temperature of around 50 degrees f
3766380 right now the u s has nearly 3 000 megawatts mw of installed geothermal energy capacity and is the global leader in total geothermal electric power production
3766381 over the next five to 10 years capacity should grow by at least 20 a year three companies are particularly well positioned to lead this growth starting with chevron
3766382 while oil of course is its main focus chevron is the world s largest geothermal energy producer with facilities that include two plants in indonesia and two in the philippines the company s huge capital base gives it the wherewithal to fund continued research and installations
3766383 with 2007 representing chevron s fourth consecutive year of record earnings the company is a strong pick for many reasons making it a safe way to get in on geothermal s expected expansion
3766384 a riskier play is calpine corp the primary producer of geothermal energy in north america it s the operator of the huge geothermal facilities at the geysers which meet nearly 70 of the average electrical demand for california s north coast region
3766385 calpine created in 1984 grew rapidly in its first two decades aggressively purchasing natural gas fields and gas turbine plants as well as moving into geothermal energy and by 2001 it was the world s ninth largest producer of electricity
3766386 in 2005 however it filed for bankruptcy as its aggressive leveraged expansion efforts foundered in the wake of california s energy crisis of the early 2000s and enron s collapse early this year the company emerged from bankruptcy with its old shares canceled and new stock issued
3766387 finally the pure play geothermal company with the best defined growth prospects is ormat technologies it s the second largest producer of geothermal electricity in the u s which accounts for around 75 of the company s revenues
3766388 its 11 geothermal power plants produce an average of 32 mw per year per plant and it has a further 270 mw of capacity in various stages of development
3766389 ormat is a leader not only in geothermal energy but also in recovered energy power generation which refers to the capturing of waste heat generated from industrial processes and converting it into electricity
3766390 the company s growth will become more visible as interest in geothermal power generation increases
3766391 ormat s reputation is built on its pioneering work the company owns more than 75 patents and has the sector s leading technology and on the fact that it designs and makes most of the equipment it uses further boosting its importance within the sector

3766436 the falcons run two types of zone plays inside and outside the only real difference is the backs aiming point the play side guard for inside zone the play side tight end or the spot where the tight end would be if there is not one in the formation for outside zone if a play is going left each lineman and tight end is responsible for the gap to his left so when the ball is snapped all the linemen step left with their left foot if they encounter a player in their assigned gap they block that player if not they continue along their track until they find a player to block the backs aiming point is just a suggestion he may choose any hole as long as he does it decisively

3766441 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3766448 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3766449 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3766450 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3766451 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3766452 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3766453 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3766454 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3766455 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3766456 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3766457 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3766458 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3766459 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3766460 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3766461 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3766462 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3766463 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3766464 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3766465 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3766466 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3766467 i cant believe it i actually had fun with my family
3766468 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3766469 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3766470 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3766471 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3766472 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3766473 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3766474 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3766475 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3766476 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3766477 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3766478 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3766479 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3766480 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3766481 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3766482 i did it i did it i killed the evil bastards
3766483 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3766484 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3766485 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3766486 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3766487 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3766488 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3766489 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3766490 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3766491 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3766492 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3766493 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3766494 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3766495 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3766496 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3766497 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3766501 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3766502 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3766503 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3766504 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3766505 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3766506 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3766534 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3766535 i have never texted or e mailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3766536 ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
3766537 i feel that at times you can harm the person that you are trying to help
3766538 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate
3766539 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it

3766544 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
3766545 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
3766546 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
3766547 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
3766548 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
3766549 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
3766550 im blown away every time i walk past that apple store and theres always people queued up outside to get in
3766551 by october and more likely by september all best buy locations should have iphones on hand to sell to customers lavish video displays like those erected in apple retail store windows ahead of the phones launch may also turn up at the electronics stores

3766573 this is a legitimate question to be asking in light of the fact that he is apparently renting from someone with an interest in his official actions as a senator

3766587 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
3766588 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
3766589 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
3766590 might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people
3766591 the catechism is not the place where you work out difficult theological problems
3766592 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
3766593 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all
3766594 it is also the churchs understanding that the full incorporation of israel into the saving covenant of christ may be the fruit of the end times may not happen until the end of history

3766617 obama campaign spokeswoman shannon gilson issued a statement monday saying it was the campaigns priority to ensure ms
3766618 this isnt sour grapes this is about the best candidate losing the nomination because shes a woman its the most blatant example of sexism in our society this is about the party breaking my trust womens trust and that cant be fixed
3766619 there is no arguing with millstone about whether clinton was the most viable democrat
3766620 how could we have ever expected that hillarys pledged delegates would be threatened for wanting to stay true to their pledge
3766621 unite and accord unions express deep concern over further hbos job losses

3766624 we are never happy about any reduction in roles in hbos even if we understand the commercial logic for the changes we are in direct contact with our members who may be affected by these changes to offer them our full support advice and guidance in what is a difficult time for them

3766636 consider masking your e mail address masking involves putting a word or phrase in your e mail address so that it will trick a harvesting computer program but not a person for example if your e mail address is johndoe myisp com you could mask it as johndoe spamaway myisp com be aware that some newsgroup services or message boards wont allow you to mask your email address and some harvesting programs may be able to pick out common masks

3766688 this kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to god and to god alone apart from certain highly beneficial and specific medical applications do we have the right to experiment with and commercialise the building blocks of life we live in an age of rights it seems to me that it is time our creator had some rights too
3766689 science has tried to assume a monopoly even a tyranny over our understanding
3766690 we are only now beginning to gauge the disastrous results of this outlook
3766691 the idea that there is a sacred trust between mankind and our creator under which we accept a duty of stewardship for the earth has been an important feature of most religious and spiritual thought throughout the ages it is only recently that this guiding principle has become smothered by almost impenetrable layers of scientific rationalism part of the problem is the prevailing approach that seeks to reduce the natural world including ourselves to the level of nothing more than a mechanical process above all we should show greater respect for the genius of natures designs rigorously tested and refined over millions of years
3766692 it is hard to imagine that london before the last war must have had one of the most beautiful skylines of any great city if those who recall it are to be believed what then are we doing to our capital city now
3766693 instead of designing an extension to the elegant facade of the national gallery which complements it and continues the concept of columns and domes it looks as if we may be presented with a kind of municipal fire station complete with the sort of tower that contains the siren i would understand better this type of high tech approach if you demolished the whole of trafalgar square and started again with a single architect responsible for the entire layout but what is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend
3766694 i very much fear we are repeating the mistakes of the 1960s but doing so with even greater hubris and efficiency corporate and residential towers are being proposed across london and overshadowing world heritage sites from edinburgh to bath for some unaccountable reason we seem to be determined to vandalize these few remaining sites which retain the kind of human scale and timeless character that so attract people to them and which increase in value as time goes by our approach will leave london and our other cities with a pockmarked skyline not just one carbuncle ladies and gentlemen on the face of a much loved old friend but a positive rash of them that will disfigure precious views and disinherit future generations of londoners
3766695 the whole imposing edifice of modern medicine for all its breathtaking successes is like the celebrated tower of pisa slightly off balance it is frightening how dependent on drugs we are all becoming and how easy it is for doctors to prescribe them as the universal panacea for our ills

3766708 risalgono allimmediato dopoguerra dove lattenzione per la sicurezza e lambiente non erano sicuramente al primo posto attualmente solo il 47 per cento delle scuole comunali risulta aver avuto un qualche intervento di manutenzione straordinaria dunque almeno il 50 per cento degli studenti e di quanti la frequentano deve temere per la sua salute nel corso del 2006 la presenza dellamianto nelle scuole si aggirava intorno al 13 per cento non bisogna dimenticare che la legge 626 demanda ai dirigenti scolastici la diretta responsabilit della sua applicazione la stessa legge prevede che i dirigenti scolastici in mancanza di sicurezza potrebbero ricorrere alla chiusura dellistituto scolastico da loro diretto ci vuole dire che se i dirigenti applicassero pedissequamente la legge il 50 per cento rimarrebbe chiuso considerato che in caso di incidenti sono loro i responsabili davanti alla legge ma la riapertura delle scuole a rischio anche perch esse non sono vigilate e rimangono preda di atti vandalici di depauperamento degli arredi scolastici dellasportazione di computer e di altro materiale in dotazione alle scuole lamministrazione comunale di napoli perch non approfitta della pausa estiva per far effettuare quei lavori che poi costretta ad effettuare durante larco dellanno scolastico insomma
3766709 it seems to be a work that will enflame rather than enlighten turning the quran into a bodice ripper is not the way to show muslims the advantages of freedom
3766710 sherry jones can write and self publish whatever she wants
3766711 random house is free to decide that a book is not worth the trouble if publishing it will cause people to die should the worlds most violent men have a veto over what gets published no but publishing the jewel of medina would make radical muslims stronger not weaker in the long struggle for freedom let us choose a more intelligent cause
3766712 it doesn t matter a damn what the koran says or whether the novel is offensive to muslims or not

3766739 nach f nf stunden fahrt bin ich noch zweieinhalb stunden gelaufen
3766740 da war sie fast allein nur wenige leute in der n he und retter die etwas weiter weg jemand anderem halfen
3766741 ich konnte ihre hilferufe h ren und dann immer wieder stille eine beklemmende stille
3766742 die retter kamen immer wieder bei ihr vorbei auch bauern versuchten sie zu tr sten leisteten ihr gesellschaft und beteten mit ihr
3766743 als ich meine bilder machte f hlte ich mich absolut machtlos angesichts dieses kleinen m dchens das mit mut und w rde seinem tod entgegentrat
3766744 sie fragte mich ob ich sie zur schule bringen k nnte und machte sich sorgen dass sie zu sp t k me
3766745 ich f hlte dass ich berichten musste was dieses m dchen durchmacht
3766746 die leute fragten mich warum hast du ihr nicht geholfen warum hast du sie nicht befreit
3766747 ich versuche meine arbeit so ehrlich und glaubw rdig wie m glich zu machen
3766748 die leute finden das bild immer noch verst rend das zeigt die kraft des kleinen m dchens ich hatte gl ck das ich die br cke zwischen ihr und der welt schlagen konnte das ist die magie der sache

3766769 but its a difficult process at least the way that ive done it which is literally piece by piece this album was done without a band i had to find people to play and kind of do one part at a time

3766776 of special relevance to the courts present inquiry congress included in the fisa bill a declaration that the fisa regime together with the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 were to be the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance for national security purposes could be conducted
3766777 the court is charged with determining whether fisa preempts or displaces not a common law set of rules for conducting foreign intelligence surveillance but rather a privilege asserted by the government to avoid public and judicial scrutiny of its activities related to national security
3766778 this imperfect overlap between the preempting statute and the common law rule being preempted does not however create serious problems with finding the state secrets privilege preempted or displaced by fisa in the context of matters within fisas purview
3766779 the legislative history moreover buttresses the courts reading of the statutory text as intending that fisa replace judge made federal common law rules
3766780 defendants advance essentially three points in support of their contention that nothing in fisa indicates any intention by congress to abrogate the state secrets privilege in the case of intelligence driven electronic surveillance
3766781 this hardly counts as authority that the presidents duties under article ii create a shield against disclosure
3766782 fisa makes little provision for notice to surveilled individuals except when the government chooses to disclose surveillance materials and the provisions that exist are easy for the government to avoid
3766783 a host of obstacles make section 1810 a mostly theoretical but rarely if ever a practical vehicle for seeking a civil remedy for unlawful surveillance
3766784 dormant indeed the print version of the united states code annotated contains no case notes under section 1810 the parties have cited no other case in which a plaintiff has actually brought suit under section 1810 let alone secured a civil judgment under it
3766785 this is not to say that it is impossible to obtain relief under section 1810 but the fact that no one has ever done so reinforces the courts reading of the plain terms of the statute section 1810 is not user friendly and the impediments to using it may yet prove insurmountable
3766786 all this patty cake about dont ask dont tell or of just accepting homosexuals in the army doesnt take into account how that affects military life
3766787 promotions or assignments are the prerogative of sergeants and officers put a homosexual into that mix and you get trouble when he or his homosexual buddy get into the command structure thereafter promotions and assignments will be seen as affected by weird sexual influence fairness and respect suffer retribution of a very unfair sort may result
3766788 also an army must inflict less than luxurious living conditions including sleeping in double deck bunks in a barracks showering en masse eating from a mess kit etc unit cohesiveness and a certain manly toughness need to be cultivated
3766789 the businessman in me must say that the whole concept of someone basing their identity on how they do sex is repulsive
3766790 adding the concept of gay pride to it is beyond rationality that the schools and media try to tell us that the homosexual lifestyle is ok is nuts no one looks at their baby boy and says how wonderful he can grow up to be a homosexual that destructive path leads to diseases and a short life for the homosexual and no grandchildren for the parents of a misguided sexual extrovert

3766798 el ltimo punto del acuerdo dec a que el futuro estatuto de abjasia y osetia del sur debe ser discutido en un proceso internacional y esto se retir con nuestro acuerdo de los rusos y franceses porque se prestaba a diferentes interpretaciones
3766799 no queremos dejar planear ninguna duda acerca de que la integridad territorial y la pertenencia de osetia del sur y abjasia a georgia nunca ser puesta en entredicho por ning n tipo de proceso internacional
3766800 es una modificaci n aceptada por el presidente ruso medvedev

3766809 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
3766810 aggression is the use of armed force by a state against the sovereignty territorial integrity or political independence of another state or in any other manner inconsistent with the charter of the united nations
3766811 an armed attack must be of such gravity as to amount to
3766812 the present convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them
3766813 an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between states or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a state
3766814 as soon as the armed forces of one state find themselves with wounded or surrendering members of the armed forces or civilians of another state on their hands as soon as they detain prisoners or have actual control over a part of the territory of the enemy state then they must comply with the relevant convention

3766818 then the truth is that after 60 years of modern ufos human beings still have no idea what they are and are not even trying to find out that should surprise and disturb us and case doubt on the structure of rule that requires and sustains it
3766819 a prohibition in the authoritative public sphere on taking ufos seriously or thou shalt not try very hard to find out what ufos are
3766820 we are not saying the authorities are hiding the truth about ufos
3766821 we are saying that the authorities cannot ask the question
3766822 is not the familiar question of ufology what are ufos but why are they dismissed by the authorities why is human ignorance not only unacknowledged but so emphatically denied in short why a taboo
3766823 akin to denial in psychoanalysis the sovereign represses the ufo out of fear about what it would reveal about itself there is therefore nothing for the sovereign to do but turn its gaze away from to ignore and hence be ignorant of the ufo making no decision at all
3766824 those who attempt it will have difficulty funding and publishing their work
3766825 seti advocates have been at the forefront of ufo skepticism

3766840 this is mr deebs hobby hes still got bunches of ideas i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation there are regulations about how much youre supposed to have how its detained how its disposed of
3766841 zero jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
3766842 its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here

3766848 the summer has been pretty good for me ive enjoyed my test cricket and ive learned a few things about myself the way i have played my cricket its improving
3766849 i havent heard what shane warne has said but from my personal point of view i do feel that adding variation to my pace changing my angles maybe having different tactics in terms of my field settings and making the right decisions at the right time is an important stage of my development
3766850 i feel it will make me into a better bowler
3766851 ive been playing international cricket now for a couple of years and i guess people get more of an idea of how i bowl and how i try to get people out
3766852 i am determined to work on my game it gives me a sense of positive energy knowing that i am working on certain areas and it excites me
3766853 probably when i take a wicket the enthusiasm and passion that comes out is just a genuine love for the game that i have
3766854 it is something that i definitely try and enjoy as much as i can even when i am celebrating i am probably getting over excited jumping doing all sorts
3766855 but it is just the sheer passion i have for the game that naturally comes out when i get a wicket
3766856 there is just a mutual understanding with the umpires where it is just sheer excitement that comes out we both have that understanding where its excitement and passion coming out into the appealing
3766857 the umpires kind of find it amusing at times but its just the enthusiasm that comes out
3766858 i get along with all the umpires really well and have a good banter as well i just enjoy playing international cricket so much that maybe that childhood excitement comes out
3766859 at the time because the passion and pride i have playing for england is there the frustration probably comes out quite a bit
3766860 you want to do well you want to take wickets and when you get a dismissal or know that he has gloved it its that sheer attachment to the game you want that wicket that sometimes gets you really frustrated as well
3766861 so thats probably one of the things that ive got to look at ok decisions may not have gone my way but i have got to try to create it again and tell myself if i can do that again
3766862 that will stand me in good stead and toughen me up as well
3766863 we are just having banter about it now and having a joke about it
3766864 sometimes in cricket when everyone is passionate about the game frustration does come out

3766901 while sales certainly have picked up across illinois during the early spring and summer months some buyers and sellers seem to be waiting for the all clear signal to make a move in this market as economic and consumer confidence indicators remain weak
3766902 our illinois housing market has been resilient given these pressures with prices registering modest losses and many regions still posting gains since sales peaked during the boom in the third quarter of 2005 it is a good market especially for buyers who now have many choices
3766903 the fall in profit was mainly driven by the weaker investor sentiment and lower net investment income moreover the gain on disposal of properties in the first quarter was not repeated in the second quarter

3766949 i think it is about time that licensing has been addressed
3766950 every loan officer should need to comply with certain standards to conduct business

3766973 just try to keep the pressure on landlords fines are the only recourse we really have
3766974 its been an issue for 10 to 15 years maybe even longer
3766975 but it used to be a very isolated type of situation now its becoming more and more frequent

3767025 our prior site search solution which was designed specifically for us was inefficient unintelligent and provided users with an unsatisfactory online experience we needed a tool to expertly guide our users to the products they wanted after looking at a number of site search solutions we found sli to be the most robust and cost effective its unique software as a service saas model was very appealing as we wanted to reduce the time required to manage site search so we could focus more on our core business
3767026 apart from the stellar results weve seen through slis technology we are incredibly impressed with the level of service we receive from the company they are always amenable to making whatever changes we need to improve our e commerce business sli is our best vendor in terms of dedication attention to detail and response time and their search product continues to exceed our expectations
3767027 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors

3767030 saratoga transports you back to the days when people came to the races in surreys with the fringe on top

3767033 the one egregious time when the protections of children failed to our great shame was the mccormack case where i thought he was being supervised and it wasnt adequate
3767034 may i say that none of these priests so far as we know even with the inadequate monitoring committed another such grave sin
3767035 you may say that cardinal but i may say that if youre not monitoring them carefully youre not going to know isnt that correct
3767036 other kids grow out of their asthma when they get to high school

3767049 pulau layang layang belongs to the republic of china taiwans formal title either from the point of view of history or geography or international law we hope claimants of spatlys islands put aside sovereignty disputes and jointly develop resources near the islands
3767050 the roc government is willing to hold talks with related countries and solve the dispute over spratlys island through peaceful means
3767051 if we want oil or other products from the earth we have to safeguard the sovereignty of this island
3767052 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3767053 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3767054 when i went to the oscars it was like oh theres been an archaeological dig and look what weve found a 40 year old
3767055 the system in europe is nothing like in hollywood it is not so barbaric in terms of the ageing process

3767061 thats the math problem we solved when these lungs can function
3767062 analysis while mccain is posturing for political gain his blustering rhetoric make dangerous foreign policy better to keep it cool and measured than boyish machismo final analysis mccain is not good at foreign policy as usually portrayed
3767063 wonder if french president nicolas sarkozy has any ideas about iraq conservative french president likes obama not all conservatives are idiots just the american brand
3767064 like pres bush sen mccain seems to think that talking tough and making idle threats is good politics the us cannot lead an allied effort to apply political or economic pressure because we have neglected and even sabotaged our alliances
3767065 now we have mccain grandstanding he scares me folks if he had been president right now we would be fighting a war with russia
3767066 why did you omit from the story the highly relevant fact that randy scheunemann mccains adviser has been a paid lobbyist for the georgian government and his firm still has a contract with them do we really need a president who gets his foreign policy advice from people who are working for foreign governments
3767067 this is a genuinely bad article how can it not report that the adviser who praises mccains knowledge is georgias lobbyist we do not need simultaneous crusades against iraq iran and russia all the more so when as pearlstein says russia controls the oil and gas
3767068 the post is showing itself to be a true hack paper
3767069 page 3 this is front page screaming headline stuff the guy wants to be president of the united states and he is taking advice from somebody on another countrys payroll front page thats gotta be front page
3767070 maybe we should let barry make a decision he would tell putin to just take over any country he wants barry does not want to fight as hes too much of a wimp
3767071 mccain clearly demonstrates his knowledge of the region and the players while obama recreates his version of neville chamberlain the difference could not be clearer
3767072 in regards to russian aggression john mccain is talking loud and saying nothing these conservatives and neocons reminds me of a barking dog chasing a car the gist of the matter is his loud irritating bark which avail est nothing
3767073 its dumbfounding that mccains reaction to the georgia fighting is cheered by some as proof of his sound foreign policy credentials i am surprised that some americans would still cheer a warmonger and want him to be president
3767074 mccain is an idiot does he realize that georgia actually started this mess sure russia has overreacted but georgia attacked the pro russian province of ossetia first dolt
3767075 it is mccains service in the senate which makes him a better candidate that obama whose resume is so thin it practically disappears the world remains dangerous especially with too many ambitious men who seek to control it kumbya and hand holding will not change that
3767076 be nice to the messiah obama dont be critical of his inexperience dont be critical of his loony wife dont be critical of his america hating preachers dont be critical of his saying nothing more than platitudes about hope and change and if you do have the audacity to be critical we have a solution for you we call you a racist
3767077 i wonder who mccain is going to get to fight his war with russia maybe he is thinking that if we stand up pound our chests and yell usa usa they will just turn and run away
3767078 im not particularly fond of obama but there is no way im voting for this baffoon mccain the last thing this country needs is a president who feels the military is the first in only option in settling international conflicts
3767079 we have enough reserves in the budget of the russian federation this allows us to assign the needed money without altering the budget
3767080 we need to approach new fiscal liabilities in a very balanced and well thought out way additional money should only be sent where it is really necessary

3767088 it is not an indictment of your educational quality because it is such a different sample of students from what weve seen before
3767089 instead of testing just the college bound you are testing a lot of students who didnt plan to attend college
3767090 a lot of variation in high school in terms of how well kids are being prepared for college
3767091 as we expand the pool for more students we are bringing in more students for whom high school is not preparing them as well for post secondary education

3767112 iedereen is verantwoordelijk en kan meehelpen huiselijk geweld te stoppen
3767113 de stormvogels lieten ons in juni vrij onverwacht weten niet meer mee te willen werken
3767114 de stormvogels vonden de samenwerking vorig jaar te stroef lopen dat vond ik eigenlijk ook wel maar we werden nu wel onverwacht voor het blok gezet en dat was ontzettend balen
3767115 we hebben nog geprobeerd zelf een stichting of vereniging op te richten om dat voor elkaar te krijgen maar dat was organisatorisch zo snel niet mogelijk
3767116 dan kunnen we ons voortaan zelf redden volgend jaar is er dus weer gewoon een ronde van harkstede

3767118 analysis while mccain is posturing for political gain his blustering rhetoric make dangerous foreign policy better to keep it cool and measured than boyish machismo final analysis mccain is not good at foreign policy as usually portrayed
3767119 wonder if french president nicolas sarkozy has any ideas about iraq conservative french president likes obama not all conservatives are idiots just the american brand
3767120 like pres bush sen mccain seems to think that talking tough and making idle threats is good politics the us cannot lead an allied effort to apply political or economic pressure because we have neglected and even sabotaged our alliances
3767121 now we have mccain grandstanding he scares me folks if he had been president right now we would be fighting a war with russia
3767122 why did you omit from the story the highly relevant fact that randy scheunemann mccains adviser has been a paid lobbyist for the georgian government and his firm still has a contract with them do we really need a president who gets his foreign policy advice from people who are working for foreign governments
3767123 this is a genuinely bad article how can it not report that the adviser who praises mccains knowledge is georgias lobbyist we do not need simultaneous crusades against iraq iran and russia all the more so when as pearlstein says russia controls the oil and gas
3767124 the post is showing itself to be a true hack paper
3767125 page 3 this is front page screaming headline stuff the guy wants to be president of the united states and he is taking advice from somebody on another countrys payroll front page thats gotta be front page
3767126 maybe we should let barry make a decision he would tell putin to just take over any country he wants barry does not want to fight as hes too much of a wimp
3767127 mccain clearly demonstrates his knowledge of the region and the players while obama recreates his version of neville chamberlain the difference could not be clearer
3767128 in regards to russian aggression john mccain is talking loud and saying nothing these conservatives and neocons reminds me of a barking dog chasing a car the gist of the matter is his loud irritating bark which avail est nothing
3767129 its dumbfounding that mccains reaction to the georgia fighting is cheered by some as proof of his sound foreign policy credentials i am surprised that some americans would still cheer a warmonger and want him to be president
3767130 mccain is an idiot does he realize that georgia actually started this mess sure russia has overreacted but georgia attacked the pro russian province of ossetia first dolt
3767131 it is mccains service in the senate which makes him a better candidate that obama whose resume is so thin it practically disappears the world remains dangerous especially with too many ambitious men who seek to control it kumbya and hand holding will not change that
3767132 be nice to the messiah obama dont be critical of his inexperience dont be critical of his loony wife dont be critical of his america hating preachers dont be critical of his saying nothing more than platitudes about hope and change and if you do have the audacity to be critical we have a solution for you we call you a racist
3767133 i wonder who mccain is going to get to fight his war with russia maybe he is thinking that if we stand up pound our chests and yell usa usa they will just turn and run away
3767134 im not particularly fond of obama but there is no way im voting for this baffoon mccain the last thing this country needs is a president who feels the military is the first in only option in settling international conflicts
3767135 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3767136 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3767137 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3767138 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone
3767139 ni single board rio delivered all the components we needed for a reliable high performance embedded system on a single device which streamlined development and drastically reduced costs
3767140 we were able to start with labview and compactrio for prototyping and quickly migrate our code to the new ni single board rio for deployment all in less than a year
3767141 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable extradition is a very sensitive international legal issue so it will require close consultation with britain
3767142 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
3767143 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything

3767150 without actually duplicating what microsoft put together with their mojave experiment some basic linux usability factors can be more drizzle thoughts lukas smith
3767151 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3767152 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3767153 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3767154 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3767155 theyll continue to pop up because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3767156 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3767157 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3767158 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else
3767159 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations
3767160 its good to see amd ati back in the high performance game
3767161 the new card looks like it will be able to deliver the goods to high end gamers a lucrative and desirable market moreover amds single card but dual gpu 4870 x2 can if early reviews are on target outperform dual card configurations from nvidia
3767162 the payoff is that this puts amd in the enviable position of having both the highest performance video card and the less expensive solution an experience they havent enjoyed for a while

3767168 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how technically pete its the republicans who propose outsourcing the presidency to a panama born candidate
3767169 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3767170 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3767171 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3767172 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3767173 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3767181 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3767182 i sometimes think that being widowed is gods way of telling you to come off the pill
3767183 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
3767184 the pill to a great degree made possible the hetero sexual revolution yet those who developed oral contraceptives did not intend to promote what the majority of americans at the time called promiscuity
3767185 the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact
3767186 in destroying the power of giving life through contraception a husband or wife is doing something to self this destroys the gift of love in him or her

3767190 in nearly two thirds 62 5 percent of the comparisons the communities with a planned parenthood abortion clinic had a higher percentage of blacks than the state did as a whole in delaware florida massachusetts and ohio the communities containing all of the planned parenthood abortion clinics had much higher black populations than their respective states while idaho kentucky north dakota utah west virginia and wyoming all of which have low black populations have none of the organizations abortion facilities two states with high black populations louisiana 32 5 percent and mississippi 36 3 percent also have no planned parenthood abortion clinics due in large part to the strength of pro life forces in that part of the nation and state laws that restrict access to abortion according to jim sedlak executive director of stopp international

3767192 our results suggest that oral contraceptive users particularly those with very long duration of use may be at increased risk of breast cancer
3767193 this study provides new evidence to suggest that the risk of breast cancer is increased among women below the age of 45 years who have used oral contraceptives the risk appeared to be approximately doubled for use of less than ten years duration and quadrupled for ten or more years of use
3767194 the overwhelming evidence in the literature suggests that use of oral contraceptives is not associated with an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer
3767195 oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus
3767196 women with breast cancer who at an early age have used oc have larger breast tumours and a worst prognosis compared with later pill users and never users 5 p60
3767197 use for two years or longer before age 25 was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer
3767198 for the desogestrel containing oc was 7 fold higher than that of the levo norgestrel containing products among women aged 20 24 the risk was 4 fold higher

3767211 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3767212 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3767213 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3767214 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax

3767219 obama also allowed hillary supporters to insert an absurd statement into the platform suggesting that media sexism spurred her loss and that demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters this even though postmortems including the new raft of campaign memos leaked by clintonistas to the atlantic another move that undercuts obama finger hillarys horrendous management skills
3767220 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters

3767223 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region
3767224 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets
3767225 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3767226 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago

3767230 i hired her and became totally captivated by her i thought she could simply do anything she was not only beautiful but also bright amusing charming and gifted
3767231 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things

3767279 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3767280 the united states its allies and other countries need to send a strong signal to moscow that creating 19th century style spheres of influence and redrawing the borders of the former soviet union is a danger to world peace
3767281 i think this is a very unequivocal support were getting from you
3767282 in many respects saakashvili got too close to the us and the us got too close to saakashvili perhaps that made him overreach
3767283 victory in this war with no consequences for russia will reinforce antidemocratic forces in russia increase the militarization of its foreign policy and encourage russia to take more risks elsewhere on its borders

3767291 this is one of my happiest moments as an ijaw man that the ijaw man is allowed to climb to the top in a predominantly yoruba state not only tells volume of the generosity of the yoruba people most especially governor agagu
3767292 it also goes to show that the nature of relationship between the ijaw who are a very insignificant minority and their yoruba majority neighbours should be a case study to others in the niger delta the political place of the ijaw in ondo state which is in the south west is far better than any other in the south south except bayelsa state
3767293 to those of us who have been in the politics of this nation for some time we know what it takes get the position of ssg for a people these things dont come on a platter in nigeria it is not all you earn or deserve that you get but agagu has demonstrated a very rare quality by placing our son as ssg as well as appointing several others into positions

3767295 sms serves as alternative platform of communications to voice to the teeming telecom consumers in nigeria recent findings as well as feedbacks from consumer programmes organised by the commission particularly in recent times have disclosed a concern about sms tariffs charged by telecom operators across leading to a call for a reduction in the sms rates by consumers it is often submitted that current sms tariff regime is too high and therefore does not encourage the effective utilisation of the sms platform as a means of communication
3767296 the network operators are by this forum being informed that the commission will be introducing a price cap regulation for sms service
3767297 well its gonna happen anyway so or well gotta choose between the lesser of two evils or
3767298 the dream team played well and deserved to win that match in fact we would have won by 2 0 if our goalkeeper had not made that foolish mistake that enabled japan to score against us they should just warn him the goalkeeper seriously because that kind of mistake could have made us to lose that match
3767299 i dont know what happened to our defenders during todays match our defense was better during our first match against holland but today i noticed that they were just panicking anytime the ball was in our area it was that panicking that affected goalkeeper vanzekin and made him to throw the ball to an opponent which resulted in the goal scored by japan coach samson siasia should just talk to the defenders so that they will not panic again in our next match against usa
3767300 it was in the midfield that we had problems with during that match we didnt have a good midfield and that is why our defenders appeared to fumble when the midfield is not playing well it usually affects the defense there was nobody to hold the midfield for us so the japanese had the chance to take control and put our defense under pressure i think this is where we miss somebody like john mikel obi assuming he was there he would have been able to hold the midfield for us
3767301 mikel obi refused to represent us at the olympics so we should stop talking about him the boys there tried their best and won so we should praise them for their efforts instead of talking about mikel as if he is the best player we have in this country one thing i have to say is that todays match was difficult because the japanese players know that once they lose they will not be able to qualify remember that they lost their first match against usa so they were determined to win or at least get a draw against us but our boys proved too tough for them i only became worried when it started raining in fact i will say that it was the rain that affected our boys most as the field and the ball became slippery and the japanese players appeared to be playing better under the rain
3767302 as far as im concerned the dream team will qualify in fact they have already qualified its the falcons im worried about what is paining me about them is that they played very well but still lost all their matches i dont know what is wrong in the first match against korea they were playing well until korea scored against them it was then everything started going wrong for them the same thing happened again when they played germany yesterday they were in total control of the game until germany scored against the run off play honestly it will be unfair if they fail to qualify for the next round
3767303 what do you expect when coach ladipo was busy boasting of how falcons will win the gold instead of preparing the team well for the matches the falcons are good players but they lack a good coach the talent is there individually but its a different thing when it comes to playing as a team and that is where a good coach comes in unfortunately that was not the case with the falcons
3767304 it was not bad coaching the fact is that nigeria is not yet matured in female football i knew right from time that falcons will not qualify when they put us in the same group with germany brazil and korea these countries are far ahead of us in female football that is the truth so whether coach ladipo is a good or not is not the issue but i strongly believe that very soon we will catch up with these countries and maybe overtake them
3767305 its not true that these countries are far ahead of us i watched the two matches that falcons played and i will say both korea and germany are lucky to have won

3767327 the priests who participated in this meeting with bishop vann have my trust and pastoral support
3767328 however in their written and verbal reports they have spoken only on their own behalf and out of their own concerns and perspective
3767329 their discussion with bishop vann has no bearing upon matters coming before our diocesan convention in november where a second vote will be taken on constitutional changes concerning our relationship with the general convention of the episcopal church
3767330 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church our only plan of action remains as it has been for the past year as affirmed by our diocesan convention in november 2007

3767343 we in this diocese and i as bishop are continuing to support relationships of fidelity and commitment and give them the full blessing of the church
3767344 i hope we could do this again and raise up another gay or lesbian but there are a lot of things in play and it is unclear
3767345 we continue to ordain anyone who has a passion for ministry

3767348 his ministry is a gift the episcopal church so desperately needs
3767349 bishop bennison should not be permitted to resume his episcopate in the diocese of pennsylvania under any circumstances

3767351 i trusted him to be my pastor and he abandoned me
3767352 john distorted and perverted my understanding of god but charles stole the church from me
3767353 the value of one soul outweighs the many good works of the bishop
3767354 should not be permitted to remain as a bishop in the episcopal church
3767355 keep all the people of the diocese of pennsylvania safe from harm
3767356 there are frankly not very many people who possess charles unique combination of intellectual personal pastoral and spiritual gifts
3767357 bishop bennisons misconduct reflected fundamental aspects of his character that render him unfit to serve as a member of the clergy
3767358 it will take time to bring the laity on board with this proposal
3767359 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church

3767361 they want to be roman catholic and want the diocese to be catholic with them
3767362 church laws are very clear that a diocese is the people and their church properties and theres no way a diocese can withdraw
3767363 that can only be done by the general convention of the episcopal church

3767481 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3767482 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3767483 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3767484 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3767485 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3767486 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3767487 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3767488 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3767489 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3767490 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3767491 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3767492 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3767493 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3767494 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3767495 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3767496 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3767497 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3767498 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3767499 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3767500 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3767501 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3767502 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3767503 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3767504 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3767505 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3767506 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3767507 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3767508 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3767509 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3767510 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3767511 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3767512 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3767513 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3767514 y a pesar de ser peque os es importante mencionar que la empresa contin a incrementando su backlog
3767515 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3767516 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3767517 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3767518 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source

3767523 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3767524 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3767525 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3767526 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3767527 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3767528 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3767529 we live in a dangerous world we never know whats around the corner
3767530 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate who has not
3767531 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs
3767532 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3767533 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again
3767534 im going to tell them i think they are the heartland of america that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of america
3767535 theyre the reason why the people in georgia today are looking to america a beacon of hope and liberty

3767537 theres going to be two maybe three vacancies on the supreme court according to people that decide these things
3767538 its not an accident that there has not been another attack on the united states of america

3767544 its being investigated by an accident reconstructionist from the sanford police department
3767545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3767546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3767547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3767548 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3767549 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3767550 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3767551 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3767552 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3767553 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3767554 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3767555 americas reputation here since the cold war is going to hell now
3767556 we have been warning them a large scale russian invasion is coming
3767557 the state department told us the russians are not going to do that
3767558 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3767559 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3767560 there are not a lot of students that go into college with the experience that we are going into college with
3767561 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3767562 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3767563 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3767564 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3767565 ten plus random tales and the desire for a coherant story skillfully linking them together
3767566 if there were a religion in which god were any two of the following all powerful all knowing or all good what would that religion look like which brings me to my actual point most religious believers dont act as if they believe their god is all these things
3767567 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3767568 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3767569 the study of government of states and other political units
3767570 the activities and affairs involved in managing a state or a government
3767571 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues

3767573 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
3767574 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that
3767575 but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence

3767593 our drummer tyler solnosky had an accident a couple years back and this song was written about him it isnt a focus on religion but it was a huge shock factor when he fell he was in a drug induced coma for a week it was really hard it took us a year and a half to write again in that time he had to learn to walk and play drums again once he got back to playing it was the first song we wrong together and we grew tighter as a band when he relearned to play instead of playing fast and intricate beats he really learned what beats are the best fit
3767594 for any company now to engage would be a major distraction plus you know that the day you start to be really confrontational with the usga the next 20 rules they put together are going to feel way harsher i question whether we can ever really be confrontational with the usga
3767595 there is no discussion about this paving the way for anything else at the usga
3767596 thats not the plan of this at all this isnt the door opener to do more stuff this is a stand alone item its not part of a package nor does it embolden us to do anything differently

3767698 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3767699 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3767700 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3767701 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3767702 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3767703 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3767704 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3767705 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3767706 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3767707 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3767708 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3767709 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3767710 but i guess this is one of those times where you just hold on and take what the rides giving you

3767726 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3767727 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3767728 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3767729 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3767730 theyll continue to pop up because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3767731 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3767732 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3767733 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else
3767734 the olympic viewer will be able to define his or her own olympic experience like never before
3767735 nbc is certainly taking the right approach by stepping back and trying to look at the olympics as a holistic suite of video offerings and then trying to figure out what pieces best go where
3767736 i have no idea how people are going to use this stuff

3767747 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3767748 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3767749 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3767750 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3767751 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3767752 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3767753 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3767754 we know a lot of publishers are doing nothing with their international eyeballs or are using one ad network
3767755 our proposition is based around the better monetisation of 1000 ads currently for many publishers that can be less than 1 0 52 we promise face to face to improve that maybe by 10 times 20 times or even 50 times
3767756 we are there to help the transition from print to digital
3767757 publishers cant just expect digital to be the white knight that will come along and save them and some of the publishers we are speaking to do expect that publishers need to understand digital better they need to understand what digital advertisers need and invest heavily in their digital output they are well on the road but by their own admission they are by no means there
3767758 theres a great pc world down the road to help when the blackberry breaks and what else would i need
3767759 finding and adding the value no matter what side of the negotiating table he is on
3767760 well what am i going to do trust some 22 year old yahoo sales rep who will dump adverts in indiscriminately or a man like chris who is going to rock up and represent the telegraph a brand that oozes trust and respectability
3767761 this is new and there will be bumps i dont expect it to be all puppy dogs and ice cream but with chris i can have a grown up value based discussion

3767765 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3767766 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3767767 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3767768 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3767769 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3767770 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3767771 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3767772 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3767773 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid
3767774 we believe the way to sell more newspapers is to invest in editorial content rather than employ a skeleton staff and we will fight these cuts
3767775 one advantage of earlybird a germany based venture capital firm has closed its fourth fund with eur 127 million in capital commitments limited partners include osaka gas procific the european investment fund vcm
3767776 the discussions are at an early stage and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made
3767777 as we say in the statement we will communicate something when we have something to say we do not want to speculate further than what we have in the statement
3767778 it is difficult to believe that the board would recommend a sale under 140 crowns
3767779 in the market it is easy to argue for fair value of 130 140 crowns and given the way the company has been performing lately this would be more correct than the share price today
3767780 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3767781 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3767782 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3767783 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3767784 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3767785 thats a 0 6 percent variance off of our forecast
3767786 we made an agreement not only to mems but also to our county to provide an adequate ambulance service
3767787 if we dont give them the money its not going to be adequate they are the ones that will suffer because we made the mistake
3767788 the ambulance is going to cost us 15 000 and we had 12 700
3767789 they say the minimum requirement to get in is three advanced highers and i only did one i think that so long as what you have is credible in that youll be of the academic standard they want theyll give you an interview
3767790 the recommendation i got back was amazingly good i only had a chance to look at it once i wish i had more of a chance to peruse it or even have kept a copy it was basically what i had said in my statement but he was an english teacher so it was written a lot better
3767791 i went to cambridge assuming everyone would be a lot smarter than i was but i never found that to be the case
3767792 sure there were some people that were evidently smarter than myself but they were fairly hard to come across i found most people operating at the same level as me and i could make a significant contribution to things
3767793 the philosophy department at st andrews has a really good reputation theyve done something which i think a lot of departments should be doing in that theyre specialising in a particular area in their case logic and analytical metaphysics

3767796 nos gustar a que ganara obama porque quisi ramos ver un cambio en la pol tica de estados unidos
3767797 es la primera vez que salgo al extranjero ha sido un shock cultural pero tambi n una muy valiosa experiencia
3767798 el programa de obama y sus discursos nos resultan m s atractivos que los de el candidato republicano john mccain
3767799 el objetivo del curso fue ofrecerles una distinta perspectiva sobre la cultura la sociedad y la pol tica de eu
3767800 en el curso tuvieron la oportunidad de estudiar y comparar los programas de los dos candidatos y por lo visto al final la mayor a simpatiz m s con obama
3767801 hemos visto las dos caras de un pa s con mucha riqueza pero tambi n con pobreza y con una creciente presencia de latinos en muchos lados
3767802 estos cursos nos han permitido comparar nuestros sistemas democr ticos y en este sentido nos gustar a que m xico tuviera una democracia m s avanzada que hubiera m s respeto a los derechos humanos y m s oportunidades para las comunidades ind genas

3767804 o tempo que nos resta pouco para tentar finalizar um acordo at o final do ano e a nossa expectativa sempre foi de tentar finalizar o acordo at dezembro
3767805 esse o objetivo dessas conversas estamos tentando ver quais s o as respostas para essas duas indaga es para ver se vale a pena a gente fazer mais um esfor o nas pr ximas semanas
3767806 como negociador me sinto como se estivesse correndo a maratona da qual n o se definiu ainda o percurso eles deram a partida e voc sai correndo mas n o sabe onde est a linha de chegada s vezes voc imagina que est depois daquela curva mas quando faz a curva v que ela n o chegou ainda
3767807 a rodada de doha s morre quando o maratonista decidir sentar do lado da estrada e dizer entreguei os pontos enquanto estiver correndo tenho a esperan a de que a reta de chegada v aparecer e nisso em que estamos
3767808 as ssm foram um problema a ndia n o aceitou a china teve dificuldades tamb m e eram os dois pa ses em desenvolvimento e importadores e que defendiam as ssms e os exportadores os estados unidos sobretudo n o aceitaram assim como a austr lia
3767809 minha impress o que se tiv ssemos mais quatro ou cinco dias em genebra ter amos resolvia esse problema
3767810 o que est sobre a mesa hoje n o pouco bom um resultado que do nosso ponto de vista seria ben fico para o pa s se n s pudermos garantir esses resultados agora seria muito melhor do que apostar num cen rio absolutamente incerto que n o sei qual vai ser dentro de alguns anos e que pode resultar num pacote muito pior do que o que tem hoje sobre a mesa
3767811 est no mandato negociador da uni o europ ia que eles s podem negociar uma rea de livre com rcio com o mercosul quando terminar a rodada doha
3767812 conhe o o e penso que uma pessoa muito simp tica mas tamb m digo que ele gosta de cortejar a imprensa e um provocador
3767813 o mais importante manter algum tento na l ngua mas eu gostei muito de trocar piropos com ele no final n o se deve levar estas coisas demasiado a s rio
3767814 ouvi falar da sua pol mica com claudio ranieri mas mourinho sempre foi um lutador

3767816 the fork in the road for phones comes down to a few basic choices a microsoft rim blackberry

3767818 people who need to see every e mail as it arrives and be able to respond immediately
3767819 only in very very specialized cases do you need to really link into a laptop we dont see a lot of people out there doing that
3767820 think of it as a cellular phone modem a card that slides into your laptop
3767821 its brilliant i found out just before i went to spain in july itll help my game improve a lot im in the gym three days a week at the moment
3767822 itll really help my training and fitness as ill be able to get coaching and use the best facilities
3767823 i went to see a few options and had a look around elsewhere but im going to stay at cambuslang at least for the start of the season
3767824 with being at the academy theyll be assessing my performances and if im not improving the way they want theyll try and move me to a different club so that i can continue to improve
3767825 it was a great experience we were out there for two weeks and it was aimed at improving our overall game
3767826 the weather was good too but it just seemed to get hotter and hotter as the day went on
3767827 if you dont have a dinghy you shouldnt be here fame was of course on hand to watch these proceedings
3767828 were going on shore and taking the ferry to male want a lift
3767829 bonjour in the mornings now here they were departing on the same time as us so finally a chat to our surprise they are on the same route as us to phukett via addoo atoll maldives amazing should see them in addoo seems we are fast becoming part of the sailing fraternity
3767830 this new fund will help us improve access to local railway stations as well
3767831 it will ensure that disabled people have trouble free access to rail services allowing them to travel without the difficulties and stresses they have experienced in the past but all scotlands travellers are set to benefit from these improvements
3767832 this is fantastic news its an issue weve kept raising on various forums but not getting anywhere with it and it had got to the point where i thought these plans had vanished altogether
3767833 the station at present is a very unfriendly place especially at night and i personally wont travel back by train when it gets dark
3767834 its quite an unpleasant journey from the platform up the stairs and along the passageway to get out so anything that can be done to improve this is very welcome
3767835 hopefully this will encourage more people who have been unable or unwilling to use the train in the past because of the station
3767836 im absolutely delighted but without getting carried away its only one game
3767837 its pleasing that we played well but we can only surmise what the result would have been if their guy hadnt been sent off
3767838 it was going to be a pretty difficult game for us as its quite a big park and they are a decent team with some very good players theyve brought in a couple of guys from arthurlie and theyve got alan paterson and alan mccrae who we know from their time with us and are a division above us so ive got to take the positives from it
3767839 i think andy kenna who plays in a position similar to neil lennon played very very well for us he plays a spoiling role he goes out does the dirty jobs that you need doing and gets on with it
3767840 garry lynch played out of position at left back mark bishop craig ferguson and kevin ogilvie also did well for us
3767841 but i have to say everyone was good for us everyone who pulled on a jersey justified their selection and the team did well
3767842 i think they were very very unlucky to have their keeper sent off against glencairn which was the deciding factor in the match
3767843 vics didnt have another keeper on the bench so they had to move someone in from outfield and then virtually every time glencairn went up the park they scored after that
3767844 i still think glencairn would have won if the keeper hadnt gone off but maybe not by such a big margin
3767845 blantyre will be going out against us with something to prove they will be smarting after that defeat and theyve also got a couple of ex cambuslang players in their side
3767846 theyll make it difficult for us and theyll be looking to restore some of their pride too
3767847 weve still got to be on our game as were improving our match sharpness and fitness with every passing game
3767848 ive not given the vale game any consideration yet im only thinking about the next match against blantyre vics
3767849 i know when vale played east kilbride it finished 1 1 then they went out and beat glencairn 4 1 and gave them a real going over
3767850 weve got to be at our best for the vale game if we dont go into it in the right way we could be on the end of a defeat
3767851 we had a heart to heart with several players outlining our thoughts and we are awaiting their thoughts on the situation
3767852 i have said for a long time that the post office reorganisation proposals required by the labour government are
3767853 the post office in wallace street like post offices elsewhere helps to sustain business for the shops there in wallace street these include a butcher a baker and convenience stores if the post office goes it makes things so much more difficult for other valued businesses
3767854 i am also struck by the number of elderly people living in the immediate vicinity who need access to the post office to draw their pensions and for other services
3767855 it means that i do have less time to spend at coats park but being given the honorary presidency of the club and i think its the first time its been done is such an honour
3767856 i dont want to sever my ties with cambuslang as ive only got to where i am now because of the club and will continue to be an ambassador hopefully people will know me as jim from cambuslang for many years to come
3767857 i want to be able to continue working hard from cambuslang in whatever way i can and im delighted jim fergusson is my successor hes a pal but hes also a lot more than that
3767858 he was very instrumental in helping me when i became vice president of cambuslang at first lending me his knowledge and experience and the clubs in safe hands with him and susan jones as vice president
3767859 i might be at murrayfield a lot more but my heart is and always will be at cambuslang
3767860 things are a bit different this time weve got this great new clubhouse whereas before we had a big worry if there was a 200 overspend and things like that
3767861 when i finished as president before i just wanted to stand back and take it easy and play for the thirds but i was convinced to come back as bar convener by jimmy and here i am again
3767862 im looking forward as we should have a better year on the pitch with a strong first team our coach davie knox has had a good pre season with the players probably our best in three years and we should hopefully have second and third xvs out this season too
3767863 we also have a strong youth and midi section playing on sundays with a good under 17 team making their way through which is a good thing for the future
3767864 as president of the rugby club im also president of the rugby and sports club which also includes the harriers and the american football team so theres a lot to do
3767865 but ive just retired so im looking forward to it
3767866 im sorry i know i was canadas great medal hope
3767867 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3767868 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise

3768079 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3768080 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3768081 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3768082 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3768083 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3768084 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
3768085 we believe the person who shot him either was an acquaintance of his or they may have acquaintances in common
3768086 and then i got to college and began thinking i cant
3768087 i love the expression on peoples faces when they eat something ive made
3768088 my first few weeks i was put in charge of making tofu and i screwed it up every time
3768089 you do this before you pick up your knife it saves time if something happens
3768090 this is my third 10 hour day in a row
3768091 keep the seeds in those chilies just cut them in half
3768092 i need to start my rice as soon as i get this sauce started
3768093 i was going to do the sauce first but it turns out that our shrimp comes with the skin on
3768094 there is much work left to be done to ensure that all students graduate from high school with the skills they need to succeed at the next level
3768095 students who take the more challenging courses do better on the test and are better prepared to succeed
3768096 there were 42 inches in the gymnasiums here and yes we did have carp that were swimming through from gymnasium to gymnasium
3768097 it just brought tears to my eyes almost coming in here and having water almost to your waist
3768098 niki lemes gati wah setahun lebih ndek tiang bau milu ngelining kance batur lalo tetanggep ini yang lemas sudah setahun lebih saya tidak bisa ikut teman teman memenuhi undangan pentas
3768099 laek semasih tiang seger marak bukaldoang dulu selagi masih segar segarnya kami seperti kelelawar begadang pada malam hari dan tidur sejak pagi sampai sore
3768100 tidak seperti sekarang naik kendaraan dulu kalau tidaknaik dokar kami biasa berjalan kaki memenuhi undangan
3768101 saya mau menunjukkan sampai detail teknik menggesek senar hingga strategi memindahkan atau pergerakan jemari tangan agar melahirkan nada suara yang bersih tidak fals dan terputus putus tak ada masalah

3768103 when determining markets to enter we look at a variety of factors the number of jobs and labor participation rate internet usage online recruitment adoption etc
3768104 we look at the overall potential and needs of the market and what we can offer to make a difference
3768105 by joining forces french employers will have access to a larger more diverse pool of candidates and french workers will have access to more opportunities
3768106 we continue to see growth in both traffic and sales in all of our overseas markets
3768107 we will apply our learnings that have taken careerbuilder to the 1 position in the u s and learnings from other markets in europe to build our business
3768108 es ist unser ziel m glichst schnell zu einer l sung im sinne beider unternehmen zu kommen
3768109 wir streben ebenfalls eine m glichst schnelle einigung im interesse beider unternehmen an
3768110 wir werden die unabh ngigkeit dieses unternehmens verteidigen und daf r k mpfen
3768111 besch ftigung und wettbewerbsf higkeit sind aus gewerkschaftlicher sicht gleichrangige unternehmensziele
3768112 dont throw away the old bucket until you know whether the new one holds water
3768113 wir h ren uns nat rlich an was swiss life von uns m chte
3768114 infotainment kann hier gezielt platziert werden um bei der zielgruppe kommentare und nutzeraktionen zu provozieren die wiederum von analysewerkzeugen wie tubemogul automatisch verfolgt werden k nnen
3768115 marktforschung ist aus unserem t glichen leben aus den entscheidungsprozeduren bei privaten und ffentlichen auftraggebern nicht wegzudenken weil sie die informationen liefert die f r die kenntnis und das verst ndnis des status quo und f r zukunftsorientierte entscheidungen notwendige unterlagen darstellen
3768116 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3768117 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3768118 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3768119 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3768120 the day i thought id never get through i got over you
3768121 mungkin dia kecapaian soalnya dia juga puasa tiap hari mungkin juga karena panca roba
3768122 the only card accepted at the beijing 2008 olympic games
3768123 its an attempt to show olympic advertisers all the eyeballs that are watching the ads for they paid such a hefty price and if they can do it with the olympics why not for the new fall tv season and beyond
3768124 everybody in the world thinks we are gonna get our clocks cleaned this fall
3768125 we got to washington and got fat lazy and greedy misbehaving and not trusting the vote of the people not trusting their instincts
3768126 keep in mind people do not reject the values that we hold on to and believe in what they rejected was our misbehavior what theyve rejected was our failure to lead
3768127 we bother because were principled individuals we bother because we care for first and foremost about the right of the individual to achieve his or her dreams
3768128 the time we live in tells us the grass is not greener trust me
3768129 when i think about president barak obama john mccain looks real good to me
3768130 i cant tell you the number of people who come up to me at starbucks and go gee i didnt know omalley was gonna raise our taxes
3768131 i have enclosed certified funds for each year that the homestead tax credit was applied covering the years of 2003 to 2008 as a total repayment of the tax credit
3768132 alle haben im rahmen der krise angst sich risiken einzukaufen durch die man selbst ins schleudern kommt
3768133 die konsolidierung der landesbanken ist dringender denn je aber es ist auch schwieriger denn je
3768134 das war schon ein bisschen berraschend dass so offene signale aus stuttgart kommen nach zuletzt eher zur ckhaltenden u erungen
3768135 in der krise ist es so dass eins plus eins nicht zwei gibt sondern 1 5 daran hat ein bankvorstand keinen spa
3768136 i mean skipping the line is really cool and it boosts my confidence for sure

3768139 det hadde jeg ikke men det jeg manglet p erfaring tok jeg igjen p entusiasme
3768140 when considering applicants from christian high schools the university of california system does not have to recognize courses that reject evolution or declare the bible infallible a federal judge has ruled
3768141 exposing and combating the leftist media has never been such fun
3768142 we have enough reserves in the budget of the russian federation this allows us to assign the needed money without altering the budget
3768143 we need to approach new fiscal liabilities in a very balanced and well thought out way additional money should only be sent where it is really necessary
3768144 a convoy of russian tanks left gori but is not heading to tbilisi
3768145 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy
3768146 remember a time when we assumed that presidents didnt lie to the american people
3768147 you have to assume that he thinks that its necessary to lie for the good of the country because its so important for him to get elected thats just a different version of what john edwards did narcissism by any name
3768148 and he is screaming and it is upsetting the patients
3768149 was that we were using federal funds to pay for lobbying
3768150 he was screaming i am going to defund her i am going to get the federal government to defund you h e rants and he raves and finally he hangs up on me
3768151 isnt this the same kind of anti semitic attacks that have been labeled at joe and other prominent jewish leaders
3768152 obama isnt patriotic he doesnt really love his country hes an outsider who wants other countries other than america to succeed
3768153 condi might take it because oblivion and derision await her in the future otherwise
3768154 as our business results as well as various customer research shows we are on track towards fulfilling our goal
3768155 i mean skipping the line is really cool and it boosts my confidence for sure
3768156 el torito concepcion will defend his newly won title against mexican warrior jorge arce in mexico city on september 15

3768159 i really dont want someone on the streets of hollywood who just failed to identify the vice president of the united states on one of jay lenos
3768160 given that we require basic knowledge to become a citizen or operate a motor vehicle is choosing the future of the country a responsibility that should have stricter requirements
3768161 i just keep saying to myself greatest olympian of all time over and over
3768162 it hasnt sunk in yet but its a great thing to hear people say it
3768163 hes just a normal person although maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3768164 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3768165 im just trying to get through everything its a lot of racing and its not easy
3768166 i am trying to take one race at a time
3768167 specifically we believe synovus has performed relatively well year to date
3768168 we are actually encouraged by the stability in the 30 to 89 day delinquencies in the second quarter of 2008 and the potential sale of 100 million in non performing loans by year end
3768169 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
3768170 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
3768171 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
3768172 knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
3768173 knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
3768174 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
3768175 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
3768176 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records
3768177 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3768178 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3768179 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3768180 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3768181 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3768182 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3768183 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3768184 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3768185 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3768186 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3768187 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3768188 this disastrous proposal makes about as much sense as eliminating homeland security at airports
3768189 sure it would make air travel more convenient but it would put passengers at greater risk just as this proposal would put wildlife at greater risk
3768190 the very agencies that have often resisted efforts to adjust their projects to accommodate the needs of rare wildlife would now be put in charge of deciding whether any adjustment is needed
3768191 although the bush administration claims its proposal would make only narrow changes to existing regulations these unprecedented changes would have broad consequences imperiling hundreds of endangered species nationwide
3768192 for the first time we will be able to identify the family of king tut

3768211 el enemigo dentro de esa supuesta concepci n nacionalista que pueda anidar en algunas bases de una organizaci n terrorista o de un fen meno social que justifica la pr ctica de la violencia de eta es el pnv
3768212 ese movimiento va evolucionando a un fen meno de radicalizaci n incluso con una diferencialidad con respecto a afinidades supuestamente ideol gicas que pudieran haber existido en generaciones anteriores
3768213 lo que me preocupa realmente de ese mundo de cara a una posible resocializaci n e reinserci n en la sociedad es que est alimentado en el odio
3768214 a josu erkoreka no le neg que ese acuerdo con pp rechazara un final dialogado de la violencia
3768215 haber una garant a para que nadie pueda valerse en la ambig edad de que no ha habido un pronunciamiento sobre el final definitivo de la violencia y ma ana sale una escisi n pasado ma ana no s qu organizaci n
3768216 tiene que haber un pronunciamiento de final definitivo de la violencia por parte de eta y dentro de ese fen meno adyacente al terrorismo tiene que haber un final dialogado que no tiene que contemplar objetivos pol ticos
3768217 alguna informaci n podemos tener tambi n el pnv de que hay un malestar dentro de ese mundo en el que se llega a la reflexi n de si hay presos de primera y de presos de segunda en la medida en que hay una directriz de no abonar fianzas para salir en libertad condicional y sin embago hay quien sale en libertad condicional mediante el pago de fianza sobre si retomando experiencias anteriores hay una contestaci n tambi n a la v a de la pr ctica de la violencia

3768232 los productos que contienen estas cremas que otorgan el factor de protecci n a un ni o de cinco a os pueden provocar en cambio verdaderas alteraciones en la piel en un beb de seis meses
3768233 eso no significa que un ni o con menos de seis meses no pueda estar al aire libre o en zonas costeras sino que la exposici n al sol tiene que estar reglada y que los padres sepan que a esas edades el ni o no debe de estar en la playa
3768234 est indicado en adultos y ni os pero no en beb s ya que estar amos obviando las fuertes irritaciones de piel que les pueden provocar

3768247 lindsay is great but shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up

3768270 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
3768271 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3768272 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3768273 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3768274 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm

3768290 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not
3768291 there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help
3768292 when its so hard to reach these kids why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference
3768293 arguing that federal wiretapping law protects emails from unauthorized interception while they are temporarily stored on the email servers that transmit them
3768294 be sure you keep your hands in your pockets them things are always looking for a hand out
3768295 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
3768296 we tried to get as many co sponsors as we could and we postured the thing as anti vigilante violence

3768349 at the same time though more and more chains are giving incentives to buyers tied to individual and company performance
3768350 all of this is occurring at a time when the buyer has taken on a far more specialized role in larger retail organizations
3768351 years ago buyers were involved in everything from product design development and sourcing to the allocation of goods to the stores today a number of those functions are handled by other departments with the buyer essentially responsible for coordinating the efforts of all those teams while understanding the needs of the stores customers

3768449 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3768450 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3768451 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3768452 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3768453 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3768454 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama

3768514 exactly right micro change of a bacterium to overcome a hostile environment but when the threat subsides the evolution bactirium resorts back to its former self no gross change for anyone who buys the line of evolution crap please explain the human eyeball if this was covered please to show me where
3768515 science does not include evolution until it is proven so it is you inventing science and it wont be proven ever because it didnt happen
3768516 it does not stand up to peer review by the majority of the scientific community
3768517 all scientist and sources will be used not just marxist darwinian brainwashing material the majority of academia in the evolution camp only proves there is a new world order darwin rose with marxism
3768518 there are many debates on youtube and google go check them out and see
3768519 all youve done is to deny and plead ignorance of polystrates and the chalk layers and not followed any of the links the one link shows fossils are formed in months not millions of years
3768520 the most deadly of all religions is pagans out of rome that did create this marxist secular human atheism
3768521 i point this out for a couple reasons but the main is that there is a marxist nwo political agenda pushing evolution in the schools and controlled media
3768522 george bush is neither creationist nor christian but belongs to the order of death and other pagan secret societies sun religions who btw believe in evolution further bush oversees the education system if he disagreed with evolution and atheism he could have ended it but atheist are a tool of the globalist see nazis the globalist marxist have no intention of ending their indoctrination system
3768523 the jesuits took russia with the russian revolution the russian orthodox is as pagan as the vatican and the jesuits which teach evolution these jesuits started marxism and are the main propagators of it today
3768524 if i had followed the links i would have found a
3768525 youve neither debunked nor provided any support for a million billion year old anything ill ask again prove something anything
3768526 as we see fossils do happen rapidly when creatures die they decay and are scavenged the only way to get a fossil without decay is with flood sediment volcanic ect and in the case of delicate structure creatures jellyfish rapid flood sediment deposition that have captured every minute detail these are found globally at geolayers claimed to all be the same age cambrian the only way to arrive at our fossil record is a global flood
3768527 but really you are the one making a claim of a million year old fossil with no proof
3768528 that is what is assumed they do move slowly most of the time but have been observed to raise quickly as with new island formations and mtns show evidences too have risen rapidly too
3768529 the mid atlantic ridge shows deep sediment walls and is theorized to have shelf slid where they are today forming parallel mtns this theory popular with many scientist explains mtns and oceans much better than un uniformitarian theory
3768530 the water only became saline with continent runoff erosion the fish adapted just as the other animals di many died
3768531 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3768532 until we see these alleged fossils filling the textbooks they are more of the deception so often found
3768533 you have not explained away either the missing geocolumn erosion nonconformities or the polystrates fossils found all over the planet claiming they are few to local floods
3768534 again we need to see the real fossil not a drawing of an alleged fossil not a plaster cast a child can tell the difference i dont need anyone to tell me what to think i can look at how a building falls and tell somethings not right with some of these so called experts
3768535 there is only one museum that i know of that exhibits fakes and that is the creation museum such as what fakes
3768536 those are needed appendages that have always been that way and will always be there the whales snakes and others with hind claws use them for mating they wouldnt be able to breed without it fabricating fully formed legs as found in the museum and in textbooks is not science but pagan fantasy religion whales have always been whales snakes have always been snakes and dinosaurs did not evolve into any chicken a chicken has always been a chicken
3768537 there is lacking fossils to support any of this including whale legs
3768538 mt st helens is light years from the grand canyon in physical make up the former generated igneous rock and volcanic ash not a sedimentary rock in sight the grand canyon on the other hand is sedimentary layers sandstones limestones etc
3768539 there were still polystrate trees showing how they form and that trees stripped of bark and limbs are known to have been in a flood
3768540 at mount st helens both unfossilized and partially fossilized polystrate trees were observed in many outcrops of volcanic debris and mud flows lahars and pyroclastic flow deposits along the south toutle and other rivers
3768541 wide genetic variation is not evolution the fish are still fish the virus is still a virus natural selection is not evolution only preserves the best of the kind adaptation is built into genetics it is not evolution but is reversible
3768542 try as scientist may they have not been able to get a fruit fly to evolve not even a beneficail mutation
3768543 dont need any of your qualifications to watch a dirt model
3768544 you agree through your use of this forum that you will not post any material which is false defamatory inaccurate
3768545 carbon dating of magmatic rocks shows the earth to be circa 4 5 billion years old
3768546 carbon dating of magmatic rocks shows the earth to be circa 4 5 billion years old
3768547 it is obvious that radiometric techniques may not be the absolute dating methods that they are claimed to be age estimates on a given geological stratum by different radiometric methods are often quite different sometimes by hundreds of millions of years there is no absolutely reliable long term radiological clock
3768548 the age of our globe is presently thought to be some 4 5 billion years based on radio decay rates of uranium and thorium such confirmation may be shortlived as nature is not to be discovered quite so easily there has been in recent years the horrible realization that radio decay rates are not as constant as previously thought nor are they immune to environmental influences and this could mean that the atomic clocks are reset during some global disaster and events which brought the mesozoic to a close may not be 65 million years ago but rather within the age and memory of man
3768549 dr robert h brown of geoscience research institute has shown from radiocarbon dates of ancient peat deposits that the concentration of radiocarbon in living organisms he suggests two most probable causes first the production of radiocarbon before the flood may have been reduced by a geomagnetic field stronger than the modern field dr browns analysis shows that the pre flood geomagnetic field could have been greater than the modern value by a factor of four this stronger field would have deflected more of the incoming cosmic radiation which produces the radiocarbon in the upper atmosphere the effect would have been to increase the radiocarbon ages of pre flood fossils by 6 000 years second the huge deposits of coal petroleum and other organic carbon in the earths crust are evidence that the global flood removed a very large amount of carbon from the exchangeable inventory as a consequence the radiocarbon produced each year before the flood was mixed in a much larger carbon inventory and was therefore highly diluted dr brown estimates that this factor could add 34 000 years to the radiocarbon ages of pre flood or flood fossils in addition there is evidence of the formation of large carbonate rock deposits which immobilized much circulating carbon dr brown estimates that this could have added another 6 000 years to the radiocarbon ages of fossils dating from the time of the flood or before the maximum correction foreseen in dr browns analysis of radiocarbon age estimates is therefore 51 000 years with this range of possible corrections it is entirely possible that all radiocarbon dates could be corrected to fall within a plausible biblical time frame the information required to make the actual corrections is not yet in hand however

3768817 it seems that they i e gog and magog represent none too badly the present state of world politics world politics like the history of gog and magog are very confused and much disputed still i think there is room for both of them on the one side is gog and on the other is magog but be careful my lord mayor when you put them back to keep them from colliding with each other for if that happens both gog and magog would be smashed to pieces and we should all have to begin all over again and begin from the bottom of the pit
3768818 its a pity god didnt consult us when he made the world
3768819 there is a destruction in store for arabia because of turmoil which is at hand the barrier of gog and magog has opened so much and sufyan made a sign of ten with the help of his hand in order to indicate the width of the gap and i said allahs messenger would we be perished in spite of the fact that there would be good people amongst us thereupon he said of course but only when the evil predominates
3768820 i do not consider that historical or geographical considerations have much bearing on a story treated as a parable as zul qarnains story is indeed all stories or narrations are referred to in the quran as parables for their spiritual meaning heated controversies or dogmatic assertions as to precise dates personalities or localities seem to me to be out of place
3768821 the question of yajuj and majuj gog and magog and the iron barrier built to keep them out is of some interest it is practically agreed that they were the wild tribes of central asia which have made inroads on settled kingdoms and empires
3768822 the best known in modern times is at the town and seaport of derbend in the middle of the western coast of the caspian sea
3768823 the gate which corresponds exactly to the quranic description and has the best claim to be connected with alexanders story is near another derbend in central asia hissar district about 150 miles south east of bukhara
3768824 if then the barrier in surah 18 95 98 refers to the iron gate near bukhara we are able to proceed to a consideration of the gog magog people with some confidence they were the mongol tribes on the other side of the barrier while the industrious men who did not understand zul qarnains language were the turks with their agglutinative language so different from the languages then spoken in western asia the barrier served its purpose for the time being but the warning that the time would come when it must crumble to dust has also come true it has crumbled to dust long since the mongols pushed through on their westward journey pushing the turks before them and the turks became a european power and still have a footing in europe we need not bother about the legends of the gog magog people they were reputedly giants and two tiny hills in flat cambridgeshire are derisively called the gog magog hills similarly the statues of gog magog in the guildhall in london which maulana muhammad ali takes so seriously only remind us how legends are apt to grow and get transported to strange places in the alexander legends of medieval europe gog and magog are said to have come with 400 000 men to the help of porus whom alexander defeated they fled to the mountains and alexander built a wall with brass gates to prevent their irruptions
3768825 the legends of alexander the great seem to have inspired the exploits of a number of arabian and non arabian warrior kings called dhul qarnayn one of whom is mentioned in the quran in this 14th century il khanid mongol painting iskandar alexander is shown extending his realm into the northern regions perpetually shrouded by fog beyond the caucasus on the route to gog and magog
3768826 is feniusa farsa described as a scythian a grandson and founder of the milesian race gog and magog are closely connected names gogmagog gog the son of gog was the name of the giant whom brute the trojan is said to have defeated in totnes in devonshire in his invasion of britain at the close of the second millennium but from where did gog mac gog originate the answer is to be found in genesis x 2 where magog is described as the son of japheth who figures in greek myth as iapetus the titan the father of the goddess asia of atlas prometheus and epimetheus and as a brother of gomer madai javan tubal meschec and tiras who are generally agreed to have been the cimmerians the medians the ionians the tibarenians the moschians and the tyrrhenians the moschians and the iron working tibarenians were tribes of the south eastern black sea region the wandering black sea tribe of cimmerians eventually became the cymry the ionians ranked as greeks in historical times but were perhaps aegean immigrants into greece from phonecia the tyrrhenians were an aegean tribe some of whom emigrated from lydia to etruria gog is identified with the northern tribe of gagi mentioned in an inscription of amenhotep iii and gogarene in strabos day was the part of armenia lying to the east of the territory of the moschians and tibarenians magogs grandfather was noah and noahs ararat of course noahs ark landed on mount judi was in armenia so that magog is usually held to stand for armenia though josephus interprets the word as meaning the scythians which was an inclusive name for all the black sea tribes of his day
3768827 feniusa farsa a grandson of magog and king of sythia desirous of mastering the seventy two languages created at the confusion of babel sent seventy two persons to learn them
3768828 goliaths skull found near jerusalem the kingdom times belfast may 1994 carried the story of how a leading archaeologist had found goliaths scull in a valley west of jerusalem with the stone from davids slingshot still embedded in his forehead
3768829 this is the archaeological find of the century if not of all time
3768830 many people including scholars and clergymen would have us believe that the biblical account of david and goliath is little more than an interesting piece of fiction
3768831 but we found this skull in the valley of elah in the judean mountains where davids battle with goliath was said to have taken place even more intriguing the skull is huge and clearly belonged to a man of enormous stature and if you believe the bible you know that goliath was 9 feet 8 inches tall but the most telling piece of evidence is the small round rock we found embedded in the forehead the bible tells that david killed goliath with a stone thrown from a leather sling
3768832 as i said before the skull that we had found had a rock stuck in the forehead there was also evidence to suggest that the head had been severed from the body by a sharp object most likely a sword there can be little doubt that this is goliaths skull to be perfectly frank im staking my career on it

3768838 the liberation of eastern europe and the former ussr is good news but a sad consequence has been a resurgence of anti semitism with stirrings even in britain fanned by the maxwell scandals in fact capn bob like most jews probably did not have much more than a fluid ounce of genuine jewish blood in his veins anti semitism is built on a powerful racial myth accepted by jews and anti semites alike christianity in the old world is divided mainly on ethnic lines with the orthodox churches in the middle east and eastern europe and the catholic and protestant churches in the west so also the jewish world is divided into sephardim and ashkenazim the sephardim are so called because they once lived in spain sepharad until expelled and thence in the mediterranean turkey and the low countries and from there to england the prosperous spanish jews had intermarried a lot with gentile nobles there were also many jews who had settled in italy and elsewhere in the mediterranean by new testament times and their numbers were increased by refugees from byzantium their descendants remained in these countries until eventually expelled the largest group is the ashkenazim in eastern europe in the bible ashkenaz is not descended from shem but japheth and ashkenaz refers to a people living around mount ararat and armenia in the last century there were very large numbers of jews in russia and eastern europe how did they get there received wisdom is that they were forced eastwards from france and germany into poland the balkans lithuania and russia but there were few jews in france and germany to migrate and european migrations have actually gone from east to west in the middle ages the khazars a people of turkish stock formed a great empire from the black sea to the caspian and from the caucasus to the volga they found themselves between the triumphant followers of muhammad and the forces of christian byzantium they resisted both and converted to judaism pre christian austria was even said to have been ruled by jewish princes and a byzantine chronicle tells of hungarian troops observing the jewish law by the 11th century the khazar empire had begun to crumble although it lasted into the 13th like the jews of the levant the khazars lived amid the great trade routes and engaged in commerce like them too they kept their judaic faith some remained in russia most went to the balkans lithuania and poland and on to germany it is these who form the origin of the millions of jews who lived in eastern europe all kinds of evidence supports this yiddish a mixture of hebrew polish and german contains no word of franco rhenish origin the hook nose is typical not of the levant but the caucasus there is no one jewish racial type in each area jews conform to the gentile type among whom they live anthropology concurs with history in refuting the popular belief in a jewish race descended from the biblical tribe wrote arthur koestler 16 years ago in the thirteenth tribe but his words were as distasteful to jews as to their enemies shamir is busy peopling the west bank with russian jews of non semitic origin russian pogroms were against people of khazar turkish stock hitlers holocaust was a massacre of non semites maxwell a czech jew would have had a similar kind of genetic fingerprint

3768841 the first amendment exists to protect private speakers not to enable religious discrimination by government officials
3768842 the court of appeals unprecedented classification of student religious speech as an offense worthy of censorship should be reversed
3768843 the boys speech was barred solely because it was religious in violation of the free speech clause
3768844 the school has defended its actions on the ground that it sought to avoid disruption and to avoid a violation of the establishment clause of the constitution
3768845 the civil rights division brief argues that the schools actions discriminated against the boys speech in violation of the free speech clause and that the schools establishment clause defense was meritless
3768846 automatically classifying religious speech as offensive runs counter to settled constitutional precedent
3768847 we hope the supreme court will agree to review joels case and resolve this important question which could potentially affect thousands of public school students
3768848 the exercise and its objectives did not preclude incorporating religion there is no evidence that a childs use of a religious product would prevent other students from learning what the assignment was designed to teach the concern that the religious message on joels product would interfere with the pedagogical exercise is not a legitimate basis on which to restrict his speech
3768849 did the 6th circuit err by holding that a public elementary school students religious speech presented in response to and in compliance with a class assignment may be categorized as per se offensive because it is religious and censored for that reason
3768850 necessarily facilitate some viewpoints over others in judging the excellence of those students applying to uc
3768851 if you want courses to be approved in private education so your students are qualified to attend uc institutions you must teach from a secular point of view
3768852 this case is very significant as it relates to the future of private christian education because theres been a longstanding principle that governmental agencies cannot discriminate against a person or entity because of the viewpoint they espouse
3768853 this case result is like saying we will allow republicans democrats and independents but were not going to allow the green party
3768854 frankly the courts opinion ignores the longstanding constitutional principle that government agencies cannot engage in discrimination based on a persons viewpoint espoused if the courts decision is not reversed it will mean the uc school system has the right to discriminate purely based upon the fact that a christian school is a christian school or a jewish school is jewish
3768855 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events attributes historical events to divine providence rather than analyzing human action evaluates historical figures and their contributions based on their religious motivations or lack thereof and contains inadequate treatment of non christian religious groups
3768856 essentially whats happening is the uc has to pre approve courses taught in high school
3768857 its pretty shocking because in depositions uc reps made it clear whether it be english history or science the addition of a religious viewpoint makes it unacceptable
3768858 we believe that ucs discrimination is clearly unconstitutional and violates the first amendment because uc is attempting to secularize christian schools
3768859 the uc is intent upon defending some right to discriminate unlawfully
3768860 they seem steadfast that students will not be adequately prepared for college because a christian worldview was added to their curriculum
3768861 that if the scripture verses that begin each chapter were removed the textbook would likely be approved
3768862 its very discriminating they dont rule against muslim or hindu or jewish themes or so forth only those with a definite christian theme

3768901 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3768902 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3768903 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3768904 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3768905 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3768906 when choosing resources that could best deliver the kind of products and services agents truly need in order to take their careers to the next level my first thought was to turn to the team at prospectsplus

3768949 for this production of agamemnon wadsworth worked closely over a period of years with the late robert fagles on a uniquely sophisticated and stageworthy adaptation of the play one which retains both the complexity of aeschylus poetic imagery and extends his language towards a contemporary american audience

3768955 the worldwide telescope is a powerful tool for science and education that makes it possible for everyone to explore the universe
3768956 by combining terabytes of incredible imagery and data with easy to use software for viewing and moving through all that information the worldwide telescope opens the door to new ways to see and experience the wonders of space our hope is that it will inspire young people to explore astronomy and science and help researchers in their quest to better understand the universe
3768957 worldwide telescope brings to life a dream that many of us in microsoft research have pursued for years and we are proud to release this as a free service to anyone who wants to explore the universe

3768969 when we implement small changes into a biological system which by themselves seem trivial their effects when viewed in a broader context may have a much larger impact than we had thought
3768970 it is much too early to say whether dst has a serious long term impact on health but our results indicate that we should consider this seriously and do a lot more research on the phenomenon
3768971 while we generally think that the time changes enforced by the dst transitions are only an hour they have far more drastic effects if viewed in the context of the circadian clocks seasonal changes
3768972 this seemingly small hour translates to a repeat of 10 weeks in the annual progression of the relationship between our sleep wake cycle and dawn four weeks in spring and six weeks in autumn in effect its as if the entire population of germany for example is transported to morocco in spring and back again in autumn
3768973 after taking the seasonal adjustment into account our results show that the human circadian clock does not adjust to the dst transition
3768974 this is especially obvious in the late chronotypes in spring when one looks at their daily activity patterns essentially their biological timing stays on standard winter time while they have to adjust their social schedules to the advanced clock time throughout the summer

3768977 hey sometimes the players just dont perform the way they should every fan knows that
3768978 the new york yankees boston red sox detroit tigers and los angeles angels should make the playoffs in the american league al in 2008 with the other teams lagging well behind
3768979 the national league nl should see much tighter races with the new york mets and atlanta braves winning the east and the wild card respectively while in the central and west divisions only the pittsburgh pirates and the san francisco giants have no real shot of making it to the post season
3768980 these results give a guide of how teams ought to perform during the season but there are so many unknowns especially concerning trades injuries and how rookies will perform that cannot be taken into account
3768981 i suspect in another five weeks we are going to have a really good sense of who is going to be the next president
3768982 its good news for mccain that hes basically neck and neck with obama at this point
3768983 but i think obama and mccain each have four huge opportunities coming up to pull away or mess things up and the first one of course is their respective vice presidential nominees
3768984 then comes the whole hoopla of their conventions then comes their acceptance speeches at the conventions and then comes the first debate in oxford miss on the 26th of september and i think those are really four huge benchmarks and how obama and mccain handle and negotiate those benchmarks is going to go a long way toward telling us who the next president is going to be
3768985 will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation

3769002 to noblemans credit theres an afterword that details their struggle to be recognized as supermans creators
3769003 nobleman tells his story swiftly focusing on key dramatic moments with a detailed afterword showing his intensive research
3769004 in the afterword three solid totally engaging pages of text nobleman acknowledges the legal and financial woes that befell siegel and shuster
3769005 the narrative ends on an upbeat note but the detailed candid afterword clues youngsters into the creators bitter compensation battle with dc comics
3769006 a fascinating authors note follows the story of jerry and joe until their deaths and explores the business side of the comic industry
3769007 those last three pages are a killer comic book aficionados are all too familiar with the second half of siegel and shusters tale which nobleman concisely relates in the afterword nobleman cannot relate all the details nor should he in what is very definitely a kids book
3769008 i had a little trouble with this book namely because it avoids talking about the creators horrible treatment by dc in favor of a your dreams can come true ending with only a lengthy afterword divulging the sad truth considering how poorly these guys were ultimately treated that strikes me as a little dishonest

3769018 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3769019 the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3769020 it would be harmful to the department and to the country

3769103 development assets play an important role in many real estate investment portfolios
3769104 the dynamic nature of these assets makes tracking and managing these investments especially challenging you simply cannot do it quickly enough and make sure your results are reliable using spreadsheets
3769105 the incorporation of mark to market data into the loan information captured in portfolio maximizer removes yet another set of spreadsheets and potential failure points in the management and reporting of real estate portfolios
3769106 fees are such an important component of the investment management mix
3769107 until now visibility to these fees was limited with calculations buried in spreadsheet formulas so it was really easy to make a mistake
3769108 we are seeing pent up demand for portfolio maximizer fueled by the new realities in the marketplace real estate investors are forced to take a more proactive and systematic approach to the management of their real estate investments which cannot be satisfied with the hodgepodge of spreadsheets currently used by most firms
3769109 the enhancements delivered in this new version of portfolio maximizer will further help those that are looking to step up to the requirements of todays increasingly demanding real estate environment

3769143 i was at the olympic training center in colorado springs and glenn eller was in houston shooting by himself
3769144 all of us are now shooting together in the marksmanship unit with great competition day in and out among us and its just improved all of our games
3769145 the hardest part of this olympic experience is waiting for the day to get here
3769146 i wanted to compete at the highest level of clay target shooting to do that i had to commit myself to the sport the u s army and the usamu have given me the necessary resources to compete and win at the level required to win an olympic medal
3769147 the olympics were greater in every aspect than i had anticipated both in highs and lows the emotions involved are so great because of the years of training that go into that one day of competition
3769148 okay we gave this mass transit thing a try maybe people will shut up about it

3769151 i was ahead of schedule all year long i was going into world cup events with the goal of just making the finals and not only made the finals but won a world cup bronze here in april and a silver in germany last month
3769152 i was really on top of my game havent felt this good in 10 or 15 years
3769153 its very disappointing because im shooting as good as ive ever shot
3769154 im ranked third in the world and i was a serious medal contender to go out there and just lose it in one day thats the olympics you wait four years and hope its your day unfortunately it wasnt i ran into some problems with my game and just didnt have time to fix them

3769156 weve got to fill the gap weve got to bring somebody up to replace us old guys
3769157 i seriously made up my mind that this was it
3769158 but the new coach you could see inside that he was ok with me shooting badly here so i asked him what he was so happy about and he said you cant quit like this youre going to be back and i said no im not and he said oh yeah you are
3769159 hes the same guy who cpred me and brought me back to life

3769169 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
3769170 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3769171 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3769172 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3769173 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3769174 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3769175 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3769176 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this
3769177 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on road pretty much but they did hold me for some time i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
3769178 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3769179 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake

3769204 with technology as advanced as it is today it becomes easier for small business owners to use items like pdas and laptops as well as utilising video conference technology to allow them to link up with work while away
3769205 its ironic that the very benefits associated with being your own boss such as choosing your own hours and flexibility are the very things that seem to be lacking for many of britains small business owners with so many of them unable to take a single days holiday

3769210 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3769211 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3769212 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3769213 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3769214 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3769215 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3769216 it would be nice to be the best realtor in the world
3769217 but with hundreds of thousands of real estate agents competing for a slice of a smaller pie its not possible to simply be the best realtor
3769218 however it is still possible to be the number one realtor in a specific niche and thats what real estate agents should be aiming at
3769219 thats how they will be able to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and become the natural choice for homeowners with specific needs
3769220 the springfield realtor who specializes in helping dog lovers find the perfect home for their family pet and helping dog owners sell their home
3769221 the now we are two again realtor the expert in helping empty nesters find the perfect home
3769222 attention dog lovers call me at 555 5555 for my free report on finding the ideal home for your pet
3769223 its simply not enough to be the same as every other real estate agent
3769224 successful realtors need to develop a plan to become the only agent thats for me the best in the word as serving a specific niche of homeowners
3769225 thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3769226 that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate the funding environment is quite different from what it was just a few short weeks ago
3769227 these changes in the competitive position of different lenders are probably best thought of as cyclical rather than structural when conditions improve as they inevitably will these lenders will find that their competitive position also improves

3769236 hi everyone nigel found this from when we were recording
3769237 this album promises to be as pummeling as anything the gold selling team of olde wolbers and herrera has ever written
3769238 these songs were designed like the fear factory songs that raymond and i always wrote however weve been able to push the boundaries and go out of that context while remaining heavy
3769239 christian and ray have been writing together for many years so the music does have a lot of fear factory elements
3769240 however weve been open to trying different things it basically fuses what i have been doing vocally in threat signal with driving fear factory rhythms along with some of our own experimentation the idea behind the project is to be heavy but maintain melody at the same time
3769241 we cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized it impacts the quality of life for all of us if we have throwaway people a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse i am truly ready for action
3769242 four persons were killed in the incident but we have no information about any casualty on our side
3769243 if they had not opened fire police would have remained calm they were stopped at various places but they overpowered us they were really aggressive keen to fight
3769244 rescue efforts were hampered by narrow lanes leading to the site as well as rains
3769245 the notice had been issued last year and the tenants had been asked to evict their homes the tenants were not co operating in conducting the repairs suggested and negotiations were on

3769251 the early signs have been very good and weve received a high level of interest so far especially when you consider that this is supposed to be a quiet time of year
3769252 playing arsenal will be a great experience for the players and if they dont become better players after playing against arsenal they shouldnt be in football
3769253 thats how you learn thats how you grow and playing against one of the best teams in europe obviously the players will grow from that
3769254 i know what i am who i am and the most important people to me are those around me those ive worked with
3769255 people have called me up to say we admire you because of the gamble youve taken i dont see it like that i see it as a challenge although ive had success and ive managed
3769256 i believe cesc will be ready for wednesday he has worked very hard since he came back
3769257 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
3769258 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
3769259 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
3769260 we know every single player in his area is very important cesc in midfield is a player now who has maybe more experience than the others
3769261 its a loss of someone that was very dedicated to this club and this organization not only the galaxy but aeg its a huge loss and he will be missed within the club and organization but for the players and everything its something else along with ruud they have to put that behind them and move forward
3769262 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
3769263 its a big day with a big meaning for us because the target to be in the champions league is very high
3769264 you know that when you come to holland you always get a good game and a tough game no matter where you play
3769265 we know as well this side demands a lot of respect and concentration they are a team who have knocked out ajax in the qualifiers of the champions league we know they have the typical dutch culture of playing football and keeping the ball very well therefore we need a good defensive concentration
3769266 i have said many times we were short of one player and i hope to do something this week before the transfer deadline
3769267 goal differential it might come down to it goal differential it might come down to it so youre gonna say you know lets see what happens
3769268 you gotta start working down the right side of the nigerian side
3769269 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3769270 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3769271 with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3769272 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money i think we can close the gap because man united were at the very top of their game last season im taking nothing away from them because theyve been unbelievable over the past two years but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3769273 i know shes on her way and will be there by the time the ball gets there

3769294 when there is a determination to deceive the illusion is very easy to achieve in communicated material alone depending on its perception which the scammers believe has been preconditioned emotionally by love to accept that everything can only be how it appears

3769415 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3769416 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3769536 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him still wearing sunglasses during the ceremony
3769537 they looked very happy together they were cuddling and kissing and didnt look in the slightest bit nervous

3769547 georgia should not have intervened in south ossetian capital tskhinvali in such an ill prepared manner this was a grave mistake

3769584 obama also allowed hillary supporters to insert an absurd statement into the platform suggesting that media sexism spurred her loss and that demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters this even though postmortems including the new raft of campaign memos leaked by clintonistas to the atlantic another move that undercuts obama finger hillarys horrendous management skills
3769585 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters
3769586 will all of you bitter old white women please stop blaming someone else for your gals fall
3769587 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters

3769594 the national composite score has fluctuated over the past five years compared to our steady increases
3769595 our score is up six tenths of a point over five years and we achieved half of that gain this year i said before that we needed to improve at a faster rate to be competitive thats exactly what weve done
3769596 now that weve built up this momentum it would be a shame to have it blunted by impending budget cuts
3769597 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving obama campaign manager david plouffe wrote in a statement early this morning
3769598 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3769599 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3769600 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3769601 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3769602 i just wanted to point out that barack obama is committed to reaching out and engaging iowans in rural communities
3769603 he has held more than 100 town hall meetings in rural iowa
3769604 we want to get as many people involved as possible
3769605 we need a president who will stand up for rural america
3769606 it seems to me there are some big shifts going on in this state
3769607 it seems to me the people of iowa are saying they want to give the democrats a chance the economy is a mess energy prices are too high
3769608 john kerry won the major cities and metropolitan areas in our state more than he had hoped to win by i mean he did exceedingly well and he lost the election because of his lack of support in small town and rural ohio
3769609 that every part of this state is being targeted means that sen obama will not repeat the kerry mistake
3769610 obamas call for change is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition there is an emphasis in individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3769611 and above anything else frankly i am convinced that the nation interest requires a new approach to our interactions with the world i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans independents are going to be attracted to this call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3769612 the whole idea is to unite the barack clinton wings of the party and get somebody in washington who will bring change and end the war
3769613 i was an early supporter of hillary clintons but im here tonight to help unite people to bring real change
3769614 part of a national effort and we felt we should bring everyone together

3769630 this substantial increase in profits was mainly due to the performance of the plantation sector and the retail sector
3769631 the plantation sector performed exceptionally well during the quarter recording a 60 percent increase in profit from operations to 407 million rupees over the corresponding period in 2007
3769632 the continuing violence in north had a negative impact on the economy and business in general and the high inflationary and interest rate regime slowed down the economy
3769633 this was a satisfactory performance despite the macro economic factors adversely affecting the spending power of consumers and the prices of both local and imported raw materials
3769634 we expect these export earning values to be greater in 2008
3769635 tea exporters play a pivotal role in the national economy
3769636 if a greater proportion of the cess money is given back to exporters it will help
3769637 the cess money is coming back to the industry but the way it is allocated is the problem
3769638 it is not coming to tea exporters adequately for brand promotion
3769639 if more funds can be allocated we can increase the percentage of our own brands
3769640 we are trying to improve the industry which has been tormented with bad representations unscrupulous individuals who have been trying to hire vehicles where the genuine customer ultimately suffers the most
3769641 we are trying to bring standards quality and an improved service and safeguard the interests of our members
3769642 apart from that the infrastructure in sri lanka is very weak therefore the maintenance cost is very high
3769643 that is why we are trying to acquire economies of scale by coming together
3769644 before we get new members we need to clean up the act that is there already
3769645 anybody can give a car what we are looking at is the service thereafter the finance period is 4 5 yrs and if somebody can sustain for 4 5 years then they can give a good service

3769655 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3769656 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3769657 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3769658 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3769659 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3769660 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3769661 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
3769662 dbns recently commercialised fixed telephony and broadband services have received strong consumer acceptance emphasising the growing potential to eclipse capacity building costs through aggressive revenue growth
3769663 the us dollar offers negative interest rates when adjusted by inflation and the federal reserve could be pressured to increase rates faster than traders had expected
3769664 this week the release of inflation figures for several countries is likely to catch the attention of many traders indeed we expect consumer prices to increase to record levels but also to be close to peaking since energy prices are significantly lower than they were in the previous month
3769665 given the recent pullback in commodities from oil to food central banks around the globe are holding their breath to see if it can last long enough to get prices at the consumer level to drop
3769666 on thursday weak gdp gross domestic product data from germany and the eurozone will highlight the problems of the european economies putting euro dollar again under pressure
3769667 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda

3769670 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
3769671 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3769672 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3769673 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3769674 these would be great results in any year this year they are exceptional
3769675 however our markets are being affected by inflation high energy and commodity prices and the consequences of the slowdown in the west
3769676 we expect a moderation in asian growth rather than an interruption which will be more marked in some places than others
3769677 the economies of asia africa and the middle east are fundamentally much more resilient than in the late 1990s their rapid growth is driven by demographics urbanisation industrialisation and the opening up of markets
3769678 pointed to a potential easing in market fundamentals for the second half of 2008 and into 2009 before renewed tightening thereafter
3769679 most indicators suggest that the economy is rapidly weakening and most likely heading towards recession
3769680 on top of slowing demand july opec crude supply of 32 8 mbd was 1 0 mbd above april levels
3769681 moreover there are encouraging signs for crude capacity with summer field start ups in nigeria and angola and a reported imminent capacity boost in saudi arabia which could raise opec spare capacity from julys very low level of 1 5 mbd
3769682 we must seize the moment we must not let it pass
3769683 come to the table not looking for what you can get but what you can give
3769684 the good news is there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude negotiations within the earlier agreed timeframe that is end 2008
3769685 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby

3769709 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3769710 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3769711 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3769712 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3769713 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3769714 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 percent until early 2009
3769715 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
3769716 it felt like we needed to take a moment and decide what it was that we needed to do we identified with the archery metaphor where everything must be very precise and accurate you have one moment to take that shot and youre doing it with poise in between your own heartbeats and breaths it was that idea this is the moment that we really have to capitalize on this is what we have to do that set the tone for the whole album
3769717 the weird part is that there was this giant screen in times square right behind us so as im playing sometimes id turn around and see myself on this huge screen outside the studio and everyones watching it thats when it became real
3769718 we love new york city its a town that can treat you really well or spit you out if it doesnt want you there
3769719 he started with a pseudo british accent and was in a kevin costner accent by the end of the movie
3769720 its sort of a call to clear your mind and wait and see what comes of it letting god reveal himself to you in a new way
3769721 if we really allow ourselves to ponder the complexity of god and the mystery of god it brings us into a different level of fear and awe
3769722 a lot of times we create scenarios as a band and think what if aliens are actually angels
3769723 the album has this theme of the supernatural what we dont know we allow ourselves to have that question mark its allowing ourselves to say god youre a mysterious god and i cant figure you out i want a god thats bigger than i can imagine
3769724 maybe the streets are full of angels dancing by my side its cool to let your imagination go theres no black and white in how this all plays out
3769725 this particular album was heavily influenced by film movie scores and soundtracks the album ended up being dramatic and theatrical with big epic moments in songs it definitely has a theatrical flair
3769726 i saw some old footage of jimmy page co founder of led zeppelin doing it so i thought id try it out
3769727 we just try to speak to the world were not speaking to any particular group of people whether it be lyrically or just hanging out when jesus christ came down he was hanging with everyone it didnt matter what your economic status your background whether you were part of the government or not whether you were a pharisee or a sadducee he just wanted to hang with people because he loved them
3769728 the first time i listened to ok computer radiohead i felt like i was sitting in the throne room of heaven god revealed himself to me in a way that i have never experienced before
3769729 of course the band probably didnt have that agenda for the listener but god is bigger than what we set out to do something for which i am immensely grateful
3769730 i love go to into museums whether the mfa museum of fine arts in boston or the met metropolitan museum of art in nyc when you look at a piece of art like a painting or a sculpture youre mesmerized that this kind of beauty can exist in this life most people dont say i wonder if hes a christian or i wonder what his belief system is theyre just enjoying that piece of work right there as it is it makes me wonder why in music theres a different set of guidelines
3769731 the google adsense sash i liked this post heres my little
3769732 playing arsenal will be a great experience for the players and if they dont become better players after playing against arsenal they shouldnt be in football
3769733 thats how you learn thats how you grow and playing against one of the best teams in europe obviously the players will grow from that
3769734 i know what i am who i am and the most important people to me are those around me those ive worked with
3769735 people have called me up to say we admire you because of the gamble youve taken i dont see it like that i see it as a challenge although ive had success and ive managed england i still have a lot to learn
3769736 i believe cesc will be ready for wednesday he has worked very hard since he came back
3769737 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
3769738 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
3769739 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
3769740 we know every single player in his area is very important cesc in midfield is a player now who has maybe more experience than the others
3769741 it worked well with denilson and fabregas against ajax last week of course you cannot say after just one match you need a run of games to see if a partnership will work but i am confident it will
3769742 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

3769762 i am gearing up to launch my second enterprise user community and found the access to industry leaders invaluable in addition to the sessions i was able to bounce some questions off them and get some advice on a one on one basis between sessions
3769763 the focus is shifting from islands of communities to the larger community ecosystem a general lack of standards around nomenclature job roles metrics data schemas profile accessibility and community ux is starting to come up as a real issue more often i think we are finally mature enough as an industry to have the discussions as a body of practice

3769776 last year saw an incredible rise in new motorhome sales in the uk up to from 8 637 in 2006 to nearly 12 000 and this year continues the trend
3769777 figures to june this year show that 6 500 new motorhomes have already been snapped up and the motorhome information service is optimistic
3769778 as people still need to escape and de stress but dont want to necessarily spend thousands of pounds battling at airports to go abroad many travellers are now thinking about roaming some of britains most tranquil spots in a motorhome and breaking free from their worries that way
3769779 you can actually entertain up to nine people aboard quite comfortably when not on the move it boasts a classy kitchen area right at the back theres a a brilliantly designed shower room with a folding panel that separates off the toilet when needed and a huge amount of under floor storage areas and cubby holes everywhere

3769784 we found it surprising that 59 of respondents felt their community goals were closely aligned with their corporate goals yet only 31 had a comprehensive community strategy in place
3769785 we have doubled the size of our community membership in the last 6 months two years ago only 34 of our companys up sells and renewals were also members of the community in 2007 75 of our up sells and renewals were community members
3769786 strategies and business plans will likely emerge in a more organic fashion as they learn from their successes failures and research in the industry right now the industry is still trying to determine cause and effect not only in building community but also in how it impacts the companys bottom line were still in a learn by doing phase which will eventually morph into a more applied science once the learning curve is established
3769787 online community is key to our organizational strategy and goals i dont really have to justify it internally i just need to justify the speed at which the communities are growing

3769805 the manager has made some great signings i never realised before how good deco really is
3769806 i played against him four or five times in the past and hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
3769807 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
3769808 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realise how determined he is
3769809 things havent gone too well for him over the last couple of years and he wants to prove himself theres no better place to do that than at chelsea
3769810 bosingwa looks good too he likes to get crosses into the box and you will see more attacking football from us this season
3769811 the new boss is very relaxed he enjoys the banter and a laugh off the pitch but when you get on the pitch he wants things done properly
3769812 hes definitely got that fear factor you dont want to go too far or upset him
3769813 he has got the respect of the whole team because of what he has achieved in football
3769814 but when it comes down to it hes a really nice man with good people around him
3769815 the manager is a very experienced man and we spoke about alex fergusons experience
3769816 i dont know the managers gameplan but im sure he has a few tricks up his sleeve for along the way
3769817 hes a quiet man and maybe doesnt want to get involved in that mind games

3769824 over the past five or 10 years the phenomenon of standup actors getting development deals centered on his brightly lit comic personality is not happening as much today you have more interesting setups for comedy so you need actors to fill that what you have in sitcoms right now are very funny character actors even alec baldwin for example is just a funny character actor who for years was trapped in a leading mans body steve carell can do it all from little miss sunshine to really broad stuff

3769880 cat strofe de la pol tica h drica del gobierno de rodr guez zapatero es total
3769881 empieza a contarnos otros tipos de conexiones de circunstancias y de propuestas
3769882 creo que sin paliativos es la peor poca de la historia de espa a en materia de acuerdos en una cuesti n tan fundamental como el agua
3769883 solo generar a inquietud y desconfianza en algo tan fundamental como es la solidaridad entre territorios
3769884 se uelos que distraigan la atenci n del verdadero problema que es la escasez de agua en toda la cuenca mediterr nea
3769885 no es de sequ a sino de escasez en mayo cuando llovi tanto se pali un problema de sequ a pero no de escasez que tiene catalu a murcia almer a y la comunitat valenciana

3769894 roza la ilegalidad al incumplir la normativa urban stica y la ley de ordenaci n del territorio y protecci n del paisaje que proclama entre otros aspectos que la ocupaci n del suelo debe ser proporcionada y la utilizaci n de los recursos naturales racional
3769895 no se puede aprobar antes de que culmine la revisi n del plan general
3769896 est claro que el consell ha decidido hipotecar irreversiblemente el proceso de revisi n de dicho plan
3769897 supondr la desaparici n de uno de los pocos espacios de la huerta de valencia que conserva todav a caracter sticas agrol gicas y paisaj sticas dignas de protecci n

3769944 michael waltrip racing is fully committed to our sponsors the success of our race teams and ensuring michael mcdowell josh wise david reutimann and i have the necessary tools to succeed as drivers
3769945 weve asked mike skinner to evaluate areas where we can improve our on track performance
3769946 i thought he did a really nice job of working with red bull and a j allmendinger earlier this year and our no 00 champion mortgage team could use the same experienced insight
3769947 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3769948 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3769949 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3769950 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car

3769955 this team is trying to take off we are a big part of this
3769956 it speaks well for the team yesterday was a rough day today is another day
3769957 i just thought the ball hit the bat at first but they got it right
3769958 youve got to jump on a guy like that because hes not going to give you too many chances to get him
3769959 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3769960 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3769961 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3769962 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3769963 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3769964 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3769965 if they didnt quit tonight i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3769966 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3769967 were still climbing a mountain you cant just start at the bottom and magically appear on the top were going to keep climbing were always there but its a tough climb
3769968 we have to put our swimmers against the best in the world more and more often
3769969 we have to go around the world with our best group and go against the europeans the americans the australians
3769970 youre talking about budget youre talking about time away from school i think we have to do that were still knocking on the door
3769971 we were in a position to race for that medal
3769972 unfortunately there were a couple of teams that executed a little bit better than we did
3769973 it seemed like lit was going to be easy but we could see nothing is ever really easy
3769974 sometimes you try too hard because you want it so bad we cant be chasing medals weve got to keep fighting when you try too hard you tighten up and you dont get what you want
3769975 it just came down to i didnt go fast enough

3769987 they can go to a trans rape victim help center but im curious why do you imagine this is womens problem whats up with trans sense of entitlement to womens time and scant resources and sense of entitlement to be taken care of by women theyre not arent entitled to a damn thing from women
3769988 what i want to know is why why why are some transwomen so desperate to enter women only spaces im not talking about the womens loos quite frankly i dont care one way or the other because i spend loads of time hanging around bars where the ladies loos are always full of drag queens i mean rape crisis centres safe spaces for women

3769994 im certain our response would be more robust global warming creates an illusion of a comfortable warm future that is deeply appealing for we are an essentially tropical species that has spread into all the corners of the globe and cold has long been our greatest enemy
3769995 climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming
3769996 the phrase climate change is growing in preferred use to global warming
3769997 because it helps convey that there are changes in addition to rising temperatures
3769998 why is this brand called the global warming catastrophe such a weak brand
