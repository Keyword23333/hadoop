4300069 there is no way in the world i will support this recommendation without at least a councillor briefing
4300070 it reinforced a lot of things and i learnt a lot about the resources available in the region
4300071 i rely on these blokes 100 per cent when im down here
4300072 this training exercise was a great idea and it brought up a few issues such as difficulties with communications

4300103 the move is entirely symbolic clinton herself will cast her superdelegate vote for obama a source close to clinton said the deal was reached as a result of talks between obama campaign manager david plouffe and clinton senior advisor cheryl mills
4300104 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4300105 but the obama team independently thought that was a way to respect her more than 1 800 delegates

4300107 no doubt there are people in the 11th district who support things like offshore oil drilling but we dont feel its anything like a majority

4300109 i dont think a group like this is reflective of the district

4300115 friends had 20 million people watching a week watching and adoring them yet people didnt want to spend 9 to go watch david schwimmer in a romantic comedy so its definitely a weird transition
4300116 dwight is very controlled and is very much about hierarchies and fish is all about impulse
4300117 and i realized that drummers are kind of like theyre not cerebral
4300118 to say that theyre not cerebral is an understatement they just kind of do first they like to pound on things
4300119 i thought twisted sister motley crue were just an absolute joke those prancing guys with full makeup more womens clothing than my aunt marylou i thought it was preposterous
4300120 but now going back i definitely gained an appreciation for what they were trying to do which is just kind of put on a great show and just rock out and have a great time

4300125 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4300126 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4300127 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4300128 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4300129 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths

4300134 i fully document all arguments and contentions i make extensively footnoting all references
4300135 my fundamental opposition to obamas presidential candidacy involves public policy differences
4300136 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4300137 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4300138 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the u s senate
4300139 obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was a muslim
4300140 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be

4300145 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4300146 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4300147 he had a great personality and he worked well with students
4300148 there are a lot of questions to be asked right now its a very confusing time for everyone

4300155 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4300156 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4300157 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well

4300162 he has no vanity hes willing to take chances that other actors wouldnt he also has a different way to be funny each time he finds a new pathology every time
4300163 what was interesting to me was playing a character who is vulnerable and na ve and has an innocence
4300164 normally im playing characters who are twisted and screwed up i wanted to see if i could pull off a character that people could care about
4300165 hes slightly clueless but he has good intentions im used to playing people who have bad intentions and are pricks the reason people like to watch the other characters is they all feel like theyre watching a car crash this movie was actually quite demanding because i had to play someone with slightly rounder edges and who wasnt as twisted i didnt know if i could pull it off thats what attracted me to it
4300166 pam brady had my character putting on a stage version of erin brockovich i read that and laughed a lot because its not an obvious choice as someone who writes comedy as well you go okay i see how theyve done that its like a route one choice i call it they give viewers too much of what they want whereas pam and andy theyre not doing that for viewers theyve done it to their own taste

4300211 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4300212 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4300213 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid

4300222 amending the constitution is something that should happen there is no such thing as a perfect constitution
4300223 the people should take part in the discernment and carefully examine the situation and find out whether theres really a need to change the constitution
4300224 although individual bishops may discuss and conduct prayer rallies calling for more transparency in government

4300249 you can talk about what a particular cell is doing or look at brain regions with fmri or observe behavior but how do these things connect because you know they are connected you just dont know how

4300252 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4300253 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4300254 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4300255 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4300256 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4300257 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4300258 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4300259 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4300260 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4300261 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4300262 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4300263 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4300264 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4300265 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4300266 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4300267 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4300268 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4300269 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4300270 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4300271 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4300272 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4300273 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4300274 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4300275 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4300276 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4300277 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4300278 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4300279 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4300280 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4300281 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4300282 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4300283 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4300284 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4300285 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4300286 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4300287 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4300288 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4300289 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4300290 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4300291 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4300292 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4300293 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4300294 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4300295 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4300296 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4300297 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4300298 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4300299 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4300300 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4300301 this system works 100 guaranteed it is the best cash flow system that offers high profit returns with only a minimal initial investment
4300302 what an amazing plan i followed your instructions just 3 weeks ago and although i havent made 15 grand yet im already up to 9 135 im absolutely gob smacked
4300303 well what can i say thank you so much i sent 40 e mails out like you said and then i just forgot about the whole thing to be honest i didnt really think anything would come of it but when i checked my paypal account a week later there was over 5 000 in it after 30 days i now have over 11 000 to spend i cant thank you enough
4300304 i was shocked when i saw how much money came flooding into my paypal account within 3 weeks my account balance has ballooned to 12 449 at first i thought there had been some sort of error with my account
4300305 it is an undeniable law of the universe that we must first give in order to receive
4300306 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4300307 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4300308 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4300309 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4300310 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4300311 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4300312 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4300313 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4300314 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4300315 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4300316 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4300317 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4300318 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4300319 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4300320 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4300321 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank
4300322 the president got out in front of the planning when he talked publicly about using naval forces
4300323 at that point we need to look at treaty obligations our bilateral relations with the turks and others waterway restrictions and what kind of ships might be appropriate and usable something like the comfort or something already in the med mediterranean
4300324 we think about turkey when we realize we need them for something
4300325 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4300326 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4300327 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4300328 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4300329 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe

4300333 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
4300334 notwithstanding such a clear norm in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
4300335 the practice of vocalizing it is met with both in the reading of biblical texts taken from the lectionary as well as in prayers and hymns and it occurs in diverse written and spoken forms
4300336 shellburner the video is available at their website all proceeds go to youth hunting activities
4300337 minnesota only is the modifier that raises the kellers videography effort above others these guys are serious about exclaiming that plenty of great waterfowling still exists in minnesota if one goes looking
4300338 shellburner is too harvest oriented that the dvds long running footage of birds being decoyed and called to their fates needs buffeting by equally riveting discussions about conservation
4300339 i had looked at this spot on a map and the area just looked ducky matt said
4300340 none of us had ever been there and we wanted to give it a try
4300341 all is lost for the states waterfowlers is that theyve had things too easy in the past
4300342 hunters have minnesota the dakotas nebraska and montana nurtured in recent years when birds have been so flush that in some instances limits have been taken in an hour or less
4300343 shellburner rejoice in what the state still offers particularly to those waterfowlers who possess energy and skill
4300344 theyre just going to cut off their fingers and take out their teeth
4300345 what they code enforcement agencies are doing is not forcing the bank to fix it up
4300346 i believe most buyers would want to know their property had code enforcement issues
4300347 they could fix the house up sell it for a full price and sell it for whats it worth
4300348 im disturbed and im concerned this will get bigger and bigger

4300354 theres no indication that any of the aliens were involved in any terrorist activity at all
4300355 ice agents were stationed at the security gate and we reviewed all the identity documents of all the people entering at that moment
4300356 when we determined that the alienage or identity of someone inside a vehicle was in question we recommended further inspection
4300357 a similar operation at the airport in june 2006 resulted in the arrest of 55 workers
4300358 people have taken many risks and made many sacrifices to be here and just because ice says come here they arent going to leave everything behind

4300375 nabi tersebut menghalalkan untuk mereka semua hal yang baik dan mengharamkan untuk mereka semua hal yang jelek
4300376 dan dosa keduanya khamr dan judi lebih besar daripada manfaat dua hal tersebut
4300377 dan janganlah engkau bersikap boros sesungguhnya orang yang suka memboroskan hartanya merupakan saudara saudara setan
4300378 tidak ada makanan mereka kecuali dari pohon yang berduri makanan tersebut tidak menyebabkan gemuk dan tidak pula bisa menghilangkan rasa lapar
4300379 sesungguhnya allah itu membenci tiga perkara untuk kalian yakni berita yang tidak jelas menghambur hamburkan harta dan banyak bertanya
4300380 setiap dosa umatku dimaafkan akan diampunkan kecuali orang yang terang terangan berbuat dosa
4300381 barangsiapa beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir maka janganlah ia mengganggu tetangganya
4300382 tidaklah dua telapak kaki seorang hamba bisa bergeser pada hari kiamat sebelum ditanya mengenai empat perkara yakni tentang kemana ia habiskan umurnya untuk apa ia gunakan ilmunya dari mana ia memperoleh harta dan kemana ia belanjakan untuk apa ia pergunakan tubuhnya
4300383 barang yang jumlah besarnya dapat memabukkan maka statusnya tetap haram meski dalam jumlah sedikit
4300384 barangsiapa makan bawang merah atau bawang putih maka hendaklah menjauhi kami masjid kami dan hendaklah ia berdiam diri saja di rumahnya
4300385 jika rokok tidak haram mengapa mereka tidak merokok di masjid atau tempat suci yang lain namun kalian malah memilih merokok di pemandian umum tempat tempat hiburan dan tempat tempat yang terlarang
4300386 jika hukumnya makruh lalu mengapa kalian hisap bukankah makruh itu lebih dekat kepada haram daripada ke halal perhatikanlah hadits nabi
4300387 sesungguhnya hal yang halal itu jelas dan haram pun sudah jelas namun di antara keduanya terdapat perkara perkara yang tidak jelas kebanyakan orang tidak mengetahui perkara perkara tersebut barangsiapa berhati hati terhadap hal yang tidak jelas statusnya maka sungguh ia telah menjaga agama dan kehormatannya barangsiapa yang terjerumus dalam perkara yang tidak jelas sungguh ia telah terjerumus dalam perkara yang haram sebagaimana penggembala yang menggembalakan hewan gembalaannya disekitar ladang yang dilarang untuk memasukinya maka lambat laun dia akan memasukinya

4300397 i do not see any prospect for use of military force by the united states in this situation
4300398 this is a humanitarian relief mission and that is our focus at this point
4300399 the united states government will then turn to the questions both of economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future right now the only people we will have on the ground are those that are required to deliver humanitarian mission

4300401 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4300402 my view is that russians and i would say principally pm putin is interested in reasserting not only russias superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional sphere of influence i think that there is an effort to try redress what they regard as many of the concessions they feel were forced upon them in 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union

4300438 who cares about that painting its just a picture of his son lets forget it and get on to the good ones
4300439 now we can get on with it and bid on these treasures
4300440 what do you mean its over we didnt come here for a portrait of some old mans son what about all of the other paintings there is millions of dollars worth of artwork here we demand an explanation
4300441 its very simple according to the will of the father whoever takes the son gets it all
4300442 i stopped along the way to clear a pile of rocks and debris that was blocking the road this chest of gold was under it all please have it returned to its rightful owner
4300443 youve earned this gold for you won my contest he who travels the road best is he who makes the road better for those who will follow
4300444 i bet this wasnt what you envisioned when you pre booked your bulkhead seat huh
4300445 how do cells decide to exit a pluripotent state and become a certain cell type and how when reprogrammed does a differentiated cell go back to a pluripotent state
4300446 this is the first time a large scale data set has been used to observe the effect of micrornas on the production of thousands of proteins
4300447 previous technology enabled us to only look at how micrornas affect messenger rnas that provided us with crucial information about their involvement in the first stage of protein translation but not their ultimate effect on gene expression
4300448 by measuring protein levels we could illustrate that micrornas fine tune gene expression rather than simply working as a switch to turn a gene on or off
4300449 we still cannot predict perfectly which genes are targeted by a particular microrna but at least now we know which of the proposed prediction methods are most useful
4300450 the basic theme of the grant award is pluripotency and reprogramming
4300451 how do cells decide to exit a pluripotent state and become a certain cell type and how when reprogrammed does a differentiated cell go back to a pluripotent state
4300452 the wisconsin team will conduct cutting edge research to address some of the most fundamental questions about stem cells
4300453 the project promises to advance the field of stem cell research by revealing new information about the protein modifications necessary for gene expression during stem cell differentiation while developing innovative technologies for studying the basic properties of stem cells
4300454 gsk believes stem cell science has great potential to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the screening identification and development of new compounds
4300455 this is an exciting extremely significant moment in the history of the harvard stem cell institute
4300456 this kind of collaborative alliance with glaxosmithkline one of the worlds leading research based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies will allow the harvard stem cell institute to ultimately fulfil its promise of advancing stem cell science to benefit patients
4300457 it is a very tricky question because the many issues relating to the sub prime crisis make it much harder now for analysts to judge the true lending costs banks are facing
4300458 therefore it is very hard to judge whether or not the banks are able to pass on cuts in their interest rates at this time even though there have been suggestions that they should
4300459 as recently as 18 months ago the impact of changes in the official rate and other inter bank rates was transparent because we understood the relationships around bank funding this is no longer the case
4300460 although there have been some movements in fixed rates this could be seen as just window dressing on the part of the banks because they have raised specific funding with a corresponding maturity and therefore subsequent changes in the market conditions are of no consequence realistically though there is undoubtedly some pressure on banks at the moment not because they are having difficulty accessing funds but because world wide angst in the financial sector means banks are paying higher prices for their funds
4300461 we know a good chunk of that 50 billion is going to roll over in the last quarter of this year
4300462 now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease
4300463 this will allow us to study these neurons and als in a lab dish it will allow us to figure out whats happening in the disease process
4300464 following the demonstration of ips by yamanaka and thompson in human cells a next major hurdle has been to generate ips cells from patients with an identified disease and in particular determine if the age of the patient would be a limitation to this approach in one set of experiments eggan dimos and rodolfa have proven that at least for als neither age nor progression of disease should hinder the generation of human ips cells other examples of human ips cells are in progress for other diseases and this publication is an encouragement for the field in general
4300465 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
4300466 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
4300467 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
4300468 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
4300469 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
4300470 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative existing under some conditions but not others stem cells under different conditions

4300481 one interpretation of previous studies is there are scattered stem cells in the ependymal layer and it is hard to locate them
4300482 but we believe that all of the ependymal cells are stem cells and that they all have the ability to be activated
4300483 with such a therapy we would know which cells in the body to target for activation and their offspring would have all the properties necessary to replace damaged or missing cells
4300484 it is a very promising approach to stem cell therapy
4300485 it couldnt have been a stronger signal or clearer message
4300486 we could see that the only cells undergoing asymmetric cell division were the ependymal cells

4300497 the russians insisted on language that was so open they could drive a tank through it
4300498 and we told the french the georgians cant accept this as is and frankly we dont blame them this needs to be limited in a way that is hard and specific
4300499 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4300514 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4300554 this king loves jews therefore he asked the jews living in bahrain to request jews living in israel to return there are two reasons for it one is lip service or to emphasize his love to the jews there
4300555 i want to tell you there are very few jews in bahrain they all work as traders they are obligated to the king and in the parliament this wise king chose from every group representatives in the parliament even the jews who are a small minority
4300556 the jews felt hostility they were victims of looting including my house in bahrain the majority are shia muslims which were behind most of the looting thats when i decided to come to israel
4300557 they refused they have a lot of money businesses i gave up
4300558 but i think that the people of the parliament dont like the idea that a jew is there and see her as a spy the king who loves the jews promoted her to be an ambassador

4300561 clearly the future direction of interest rates and employment levels will impact on the environment in which the company will be operating in fiscal 2009
4300562 in these circumstances it is not possible at this time to accurately forecast results for the 2009 year
4300563 this is a good result in a tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4300564 consumer confidence was low in the second half of the fiscal year however we have seen evidence of this improving in recent months
4300565 we are confident that our continued focus on expanding our store network into high growth locations across the country will continue to provide greater trading efficiencies for the company
4300566 this expansion which is largely balance sheet funded places us in an excellent position to maximise opportunities as consumer confidence and stronger trading conditions occur in the future

4300570 through the development of the case one major finding was that ohanessian did not have the full rights to xflix because it was in litigation in l a superior court against his former partner and brother in law ghevont tersakian
4300571 a lot of different things will be argued about this case from both sides but the one thing we do know for sure thats not arguable is the fact that he signed this deal indicating that this company was free and clear of lawsuits and then midway through the case we find out he was mired in a major lawsuit over the assets of the company
4300572 we would never have moved forward with this deal knowing what we know today
4300573 we had high hopes for the both the relationship and the technology provided by xflix llc
4300574 however the assets and services failed us time and time again which is why we had to move away from their platform and onto our own proprietary one

4300619 in order to ensure the smooth opening of olympic in beijing and the expo in shanghai in 2010 safeguard the security of internet network and the information thereon in the hotels it is required that your company install and run the security management system
4300620 as soon as beijing won the bidding for the olympic games they started to install security facilities especially since more petitioners had come to beijing to appeal
4300621 so they installed cameras everywhere in the street especially at major tourist sites and public areas and even around all the public amenities they have used all technologies to monitor people and operate the monitoring systems
4300622 their authority is actually very weak in controlling so it has mobilized over 200 000 military forces for security of the olympic games
4300623 it escalated its propaganda campaign and began warning of terrorist attacks in actuality if there is any terrorist attack its all targeting the corrupted chinese officials and the government rather than against the games
4300624 thats natural in china they use all the ways they can to for the chinese officials and businesses they have no ethics at all and they can do anything when it comes to reaching their goals

4300631 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4300632 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4300724 you can wear a tailored suit without a tie and look sexy too you dont need the tie

4300739 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4300740 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4300741 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays

4300762 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4300763 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
4300764 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick

4300779 now that the minnesota supreme court has answered this important question we look forward to the presentation of the settlement to judge rosenbaum and the resolution of this matter

4300790 it is significant because it is a private public partnership between the cities of savage and burnsville the state of minnesota and kraemer mining and materials
4300791 it will treat 4 million gallons of quarry water a day from the quarry that would otherwise be lost to the minnesota river
4300792 nothing exemplifies our commitment to being naturally resourceful more than the burnsville surface water treatment plant project
4300793 well have more water for days when the usage is at its highest and at the same time well be able to reduce our reliance on the wells that draw from the aquifers from the savage fen burnsville fen and of course our eagle creek
4300794 the water can be pumped to lakeville or eagan or somebody else if it is appropriate
4300795 we do have pipes that go to lakeville for example that could be used if credit river becomes a city and cant go down for water they could conceivably buy from this supply
4300796 years ago we had long term planning where we realized that the management of the water that we discharge was going to become a factor and the efficiencies in our operations were going to be impacted by that

4300816 de ontwikkelingen in het eerste halfjaar van 2008 bevestigen de door friesland foods in het jaarverslag 2007 uitgesproken verwachting dat in 2008 met name in azi en afrika de margedruk zal aanhouden als gevolg van de hoge grondstofkosten verder blijkt dat de opbrengstprijzen meer dan in het verleden fluctueren en dat kleine veranderingen in vraag en aanbod leiden tot grotere prijsschommelingen in vooral melk en weipoeder kaas en boter
4300817 de marge is onder de 7 gekomen waar wij juist iets daarboven hadden geprikt
4300818 als je ons vergelijkt met andere meldingsplichtige bedrijven dan zit rsdb nog steeds aan de bovenkant van de markt maar de marges zullen ook in de tweede helft onder druk staan en er is sprake van prijserosie dat zal in de rest van 2008 tot uitdrukking komen in de resultaten
4300819 de financiering van de overname bevindt zich in de afrondingsfase aandeelhouders zijn in meerderheid akkoord en dus is er weinig reden te veronderstellen dat de overname niet doorgaat
4300820 we hebben de koers van quebecor nadat wij een bod deden op de europese printtak scherp zien dalen omdat het bedrijf veel afschrijvingen moest doen en omdat wellicht de prijs die wij boden te laag werd gevonden bovendien kreeg het bedrijf een financiering van 1 mrd niet rond quebecor zou in onze deal een belang van bijna 30 in rsdb krijgen voor hhbv was dat aspect reden om niet te participeren in deze stap omdat hhbv geen deelneming wil in bedrijven met een beursnotering
4300821 maar consolidatie bleef noodzakelijk en toen de aandeelhouder de overname niet goedkeurde
4300822 imtech is met heel veel activiteiten actief in een aantal marktsegmenten die daar bijna ongevoelig voor zijn zoals zorg veiligheid en de olie en gasindustrie
4300823 eenderde van imtech is wel gerelateerd aan bouw maar dat zijn onder andere ziekenhuis stadion en overheidsprojecten daar gelden andere budgetgelden dan in de normale bouw
4300824 dat is nu niet het geval we kunnen ook niet zeggen wanneer we dat eventueel kunnen gaan voelen op dit moment merken we er ten opzichte van onze orderportefeuille in ieder geval helemaal niks van
4300825 op dit moment hebben we een longlist van circa 25 a 30 bedrijven we kijken meer naar kleinere en middelgrote bedrijven dan naar hele grote partijen om over te nemen
4300826 dat heeft geen gevolgen voor de prijs van over te nemen partijen we worden gemiddeld eens per week benaderd door bedrijven die overgenomen willen worden en onze kwaliteit kennen

4300833 de resultaten die we vandaag gerapporteerd hebben hebben op geen enkele manier effect op onze fusieplannen
4300834 toen we onze fusie aankondigden wisten we al dat de eerste helft van dit jaar moeilijk zou worden en we hebben dit in onze modellen meegenomen
4300835 dit betreft bijna al onze productcategorieen en veel van onze markten wereldwijd we verwachten nog steeds eind november of begin december een beslissing van de commissie
4300836 bij de huidige prijsniveaus deze afboekingen of gerealiseerde verliezen op aandelen in de komende kwartalen naar verwachting aanzienlijk zullen toenemen
4300837 gezien de aanhoudende turbulentie in de mondiale financiele markten met sterk dalende aandelenmarkten beperkte toegang tot liquiditeit en stijgende rente
4300838 de gerealiseerde verliezen op de aandelenportefeuille zullen aanhouden de financieringskosten zullen stijgen onze vastgoedfinanciering kan te maken krijgen met tegenvallers in deze onzekere tijden het einde van de financiele crisis is nog niet in zicht
4300839 de marge is onder de 7 gekomen waar wij juist iets daarboven hadden geprikt
4300840 we zullen het doel dit jaar waarschijnlijk niet halen maar misschien zullen we volgend jaar een inhaalslag kunnen maken
4300841 if disqus is so darn awesome why havent we incorporated it before
4300842 in het merendeel van onze zones werd er in het tweede kwartaal jaar op jaar beter gepresteerd dan in het eerste kwartaal en zoals verwacht neemt het volume in brazilie weer toe 3 8 na een traag begin dit jaar

4300844 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4300845 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4300846 the good news for fans is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows

4300909 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4300910 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4300911 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4300912 the campaign did not pledge any federal certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4300913 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
4300914 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations
4300915 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
4300916 think of when you can for instance tell your home computer to boot up email you a file at work and then turn itself off with this someday you could turn your computer on remotely turn it off remotely reboot it anything you like you also could schedule things to happen unattended
4300917 the campaign did not pledge any federal certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4300918 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4300919 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4300920 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4300921 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4300922 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4300923 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan
4300924 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4300925 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4300926 we are very honored and think this is a great opportunity for us

4300929 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by jordan and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more

4300946 hes using lots of different type faces at all different sizes which gives you a feeling of chaos
4300947 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4300948 it allows everybody who wants to do something to put their thing out there and see if people get excited about it
4300949 building communities online takes time and building strong robust web sites also takes time so its kind of like getting a 747 to take off from a small regional airport there aint enough runway

4300959 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4300960 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4300961 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4300962 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4300963 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4300964 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4300965 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4300966 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4300967 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
4300968 we have found that a lot of the initial reports that we have received on things going on in georgia have not been accurate
4300969 our latest information for example is that the commercial port at poti is intact and usable and we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade
4300970 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
4300971 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4300972 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4300973 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4300974 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4300975 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4300976 the governor also indicates that she does not believe the charges or circumstances here merit the use of the pardon power
4300977 they could have died within months to a year or two
4300978 they direct traffic recognize when foreign invaders come into the body and they can induce formation of killer cells to go after the invader
4300979 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
4300980 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer
4300981 whenever you have specificity to act against the cancer cell and also solicit host systems to combat the cancer i think thats an advance
4300982 if i give this to a person with a normal immune system will i take out all the b cells
4300983 probably and you have to ask yourself what the significance of that is
4300984 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
4300985 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
4300986 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
4300987 are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4300988 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4300989 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4300990 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4300991 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4300992 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
4300993 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4300994 we are absolutely committed to electing barack obama and this is the best way to do it so let people have their moment
4300995 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
4300996 i am announcing that i am separated from lisaraye mccoy misick
4300997 i am committed to dissolving the marriage amicably i believe that this is a private matter and will have no further comments
4300998 they have outlets in the lamp post so its conveniently located and were able to pass the time watching tv but its not like that for most people ive had friends whove been stuck in back alleys for a couple of days
4300999 its been a nice day and we were lucky i feel like im kind of exception to the homeless rule
4301000 it was crazy i almost got hit by a few cars but until my tire went flat it was good
4301001 its frustrating because i kind of think its stupid that everyone has to be out this day and not in for a few more days but i cant think of another way they could do it conveniently for everyone
4301002 its just a long day of transporting furniture from one dirty apartment to another
4301003 we get a good amount of goods and were really happy because we can sell those goods but also the really great part about it is its not going for trash to clog the waste stream
4301004 the real question is can i run yet or not
4301005 your leg is too weak i want that it band to heal and i want you to strengthen your quads the harder you work at that the sooner youll be able to run
4301006 i think youve got the right plan j d adjusting your other
4301007 we have talked they know the budget issues weve got
4301008 trying to find a budget in the scope of what they can fund
4301009 you can have a disagreement with both sides acting in good faith
4301010 i am hopeful we can resolve this and keep eu in the project we like the work they have done to date but the budget is the budget we are not going to pay 900 000
4301011 demolition is taking place the infrastructure is going in the project will proceed it will be done to the drawings and specs everyone has seen and approved and within budget
4301012 its an important project for the city and for us
4301013 russians should see that this is not a demoralized you know nervous panicking capital that is just scared
4301014 shops are open there are no lines for gas stations prices are not up
4301015 we will fight to the end until the last russian soldier leaves georgian soil and this country is not going to be brought to the knees anymore we are not surrendering no matter what
4301016 we already saw u s air force landing in georgia despite russians controlling the airspace
4301017 and we will see u s military ships entering georgian ports despite russians blocking it that we will see
4301018 sometimes angel uses my buses and sometimes i use his
4301019 at continued and substantially increased risk of serious injury or death
4301020 we are thoroughly reviewing all relevant records and statements and will not stop until we get to the bottom of this rogue operation
4301021 difficult times in our industry coupled with a weakening economic forecast for hawaii and the nation
4301022 i wish i could tell you this will be the end of it but that is not possible given the current state of the economy and the newspaper publishing industry
4301023 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4301024 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4301025 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4301026 the original star wars movies were designed for kids but the mythology behind them was very much adult the heros journey and destroying your father and finding your own place in the world
4301027 we still go no matter what because we hope to get some bread crumbs of the original feeling of star wars
4301028 im hoping for a few thrills but not expecting much i guess i gave up on that a long time ago i just dont think lucas has that in him anymore
4301029 hes really focusing on the kid market theres a sense of abandonment when i go see the lo rd of the rings or something like that thats what i hope for from the star wars universe
4301030 star wars is just for kids but everybody seems to like it
4301031 this is really at exactly the same level as the feature films we didnt dumb it down the series is really designed for adolescents kids going from being children to becoming adults
4301032 eventually we may do a tv series that is skewed for younger kids 5 and 6 year olds but this isnt that
4301033 people always want to see someone like themselves up on the screen
4301034 luke did that for a whole generation i think anakin was that again for another generation ahsoka was a chance to add to anakins character in a way that could surprise us and give us a new dimension to him
4301035 suddenly responsible hes a parent a teacher that transition from i am being taken care of to now i am taking care of others is in all of the stories that is the repeating theme
4301036 a man turns 50 and he has a funeral for the skills that he never had
4301037 he says goodbye im never gonna be a cop never gonna be a professional baseball player never going to play the piano a ballet dancer the leading rusher in the nfl all those things gone but theres other things to do the world is run by men in their 50s so im trying to decide what to do when i quit this business
4301038 stone said she hasnt had plastic surgery and doesnt plan to
4301039 like me or dont like me and if you dont like me then pardon me but buzz off
4301040 i chase three children to stay in shape i dont have a regular routine when i notice things arent quite where i want them to be i step it up you park farther from the door you take the stairs instead of the elevator
4301041 i actually think theres an incredible amount of self knowledge that comes with getting older i feel way better now than i did when i was 20 im stronger im smarter in every way im so much less crazy than i was then getting older means paring yourself down to an essential version of yourself
4301042 i think i have finally found what i hope beauty is or at least beauty as it applies to me
4301043 hes the guy everyone will be talking about that guy is unstoppable
4301044 i guess its my big summer i dont know i feel like ive had more eventful ones when i was a kid
4301045 we got all this free stuff but left without a deal and went back to our jobs but foot fist was being passed around town and we didnt even realize how much it was being passed around until we started getting calls
4301046 by all these awesome opportunities to work with people ive always admired
4301047 a remarkable improviser he has his own unique comic sensibility its hard to describe hes able to capture these bizarre characters that you dont see often in film danny is a nice and easy and well mannered southern man with a very disgusting hilarious sense of humor he seems to find the worst possible behavior really funny and take it a step further than i ever would
4301048 im from this town in virginia called fredericksburg george washingtons mom lived there theres a lot to live up to
4301049 just really absurd a lot of the funniest stuff in the movie he came up with it its amazing hes absolutely nothing like his characters in any way he reads books without pictures in them where no one wears capes hes a sweet southern boy
4301050 im just lucky that i was able to land in these two movies

4301211 if we do get into the finals it will be clear that we will be going in with a lot of momentum
4301212 we would have had some key players back for a number of weeks but thats down the track really in this comp its game on every week and its always hard
4301213 theyve got players like brett kimmorley paul gallen greg bird theyve got a couple of big hard running centres and they kick well and finish their sets well all the things that we try and do really
4301214 a lot happens around gallen and bird theyve got a good player at fullback whos in good form in brett kearney
4301215 i think he would have been a little bit sore after that game but hes a good character
4301216 i think the good thing is that we are creating chances and last week we virtually had a new backline we had a lot of boys that were playing together for the first time in a long time
4301217 youd expect them to be a little bit rusty and youd also expect them to be a little bit better this week

4301250 the liberty straw poll has been made possible though an accumulation of pro liberty grassroots efforts that utilize key internet technologies including online radio e commerce and web based social networking tools

4301252 as architects we are in a unique position to shape how the buildings we design will perform
4301253 the value these business owners will receive for all of their hard work and investment is highly dependent upon how they approach and execute the sale process
4301254 failure to plan for this most important event can result in under selling your business or worse yet liquidation at a fraction of the going concern value
4301255 sadly many business owners do no planning or wait until they are burned out bored or in poor health and then hope for an employee or buyer to approach them they sell from the weakest position
4301256 but if these same owners had run their businesses year in and year out as if they were going to sell them they would be building value over time and positioning themselves to get the maximum value at whatever time the sale occurs lifes unexpected events can change an owners timing in an instant
4301257 due to confidentiality concerns owners instinctively feel that they should wait for that one right buyer to come to them you can run all the formulas and models you like but at the end of the day a business is worth what a buyer is willing to pay if you only have one buyer with no competition how do you know that he she is the one that will pay the most for your business
4301258 we have taken some of the processes that we use over and over in business sale transactions and made them available to business owners on an a la carte basis
4301259 what we see more and more frequently with the baby boomers is that they are thinking ahead they want to maximize enjoyment of life after business but they dont know how to prepare and are afraid to get advice for confidentiality reasons
4301260 business sales are heavily influenced by the last 3 to 5 year history the ideal time to begin planning is about 5 years out
4301261 its an exciting time for these baby boomer business owners
4301262 they have worked their entire lives to build these businesses and now its time for them to reap the benefits the exit planning process can re energize and refocus an owner as well as lead to a much more financially secure retirement

4301309 but there are many circumstances when this is not the case in the eyes of the law

4301311 this is when a parent voluntarily gives up his or her right to a third party in an adoption or custody proceeding
4301312 if an adult identifies himself or herself as the parent of a minor child even though he or she is neither the legal nor the biological parent but the child believes him or her to be the parent bonding as such then the court will treat that adult as the legal or de facto parent meaning

4301382 we knew we had a business model that would work well but we never dreamed things would take off as quickly as they did things were changing so fast and we had to adapt constantly to keep up with the changes we just werent as prepared as we should have been
4301383 many people would have given up when faced with the same challenges we faced but that simply wasnt something we would consider we worked too hard to build 1800skyride it would have been even harder to give up on it than it would have been to just face the challenges and solve the problems
4301384 were better than we were a year ago and we will be even better a year from now
4301385 we still run across customers who have read about some of our former problems and this makes it more challenging to develop trust with the customer those situations just make it all the more rewarding when the customer is ultimately happy of course there are always some people that believe everything they read online and wont give me a chance to help them because they ran across complaints from other customers mixed in with exaggerated claims about how bad we were it is that little bit of truth about customer service problems from the past mixed in with the rumors that really make it challenging to restore a customers faith sometimes those are also some of the best calls though when you resolve it the customer is so happy and grateful i love those calls
4301386 management has really tightened up on procedures but most of us here at 1800skyride understand that this is the best thing for our customers everyone wants to be proud of the company they work for so the strict rules we have here to enforce good customer service just help create something we can all be proud of great customer service is not easy to provide but it is the most important thing im glad 1800skyride recognizes this and places such a priority on including ambitious customer service goals in the plans for growth

4301393 the collaborative problem solving cps model as applied to challenging kids sets forth two major tenets first that these challenges are best understood as the byproduct of lagging cognitive skills rather than for example as attention seeking manipulation limit testing or signs of poor motivation and second that these challenges are best addressed by teaching children the skills they lack rather than through reward and punishment programs and intensive imposition of adult will
4301394 while challenging kids let us know theyre struggling in some fairly common ways screaming swearing defying hitting spitting throwing things breaking things crying withdrawing and so forth they are quite unique as individuals when it comes to the mix of lagging cognitive skills that set the stage for these behaviors this means that prior to focusing on the teaching of cognitive skills one must first identify those skills that are lagging in each individual child or adolescent the teaching of these skills may be accomplished in a variety of ways but primarily through helping challenging children and their adult caretakers learn to resolve disagreements and disputes in a collaborative mutually satisfactory manner
4301395 cps can be applied to interactions between classmates siblings couples parents and teachers employees and supervisors and nations all people benefit from learning how to identify and articulate their concerns hear the concerns of others and take each others concerns into account in working toward mutually satisfactory solutions
4301396 cps promises to be extremely effective in helping us to deal with some of the thorniest real life issues faced by many if not most typical families not just those with explosive kids so we have begun to integrate these techniques into many of our recommendations and therapies
4301397 when we begin a reputation management project we keep that case secret these other companies that talk about contacting web sites with legal notices and asking them to remove content are putting their clients at risk if someone has an article on a web site that is deemed negative press and a reputation management company writes the site owner a letter asking them to remove the story the site owner is more than likely going to blog about the first amendment injustice thus creating more negative press on the web for the client that is why we work in the shadows
4301398 if you have a beehive hanging on your door step and you take a stick then knock it down you are going to have a lot of angry bees swarming around but if you apply a layer of smoke around the beehive the problem can be peacefully remedied if you contact a blog owner or site owner you are asking for a lot of angry bees swarming the web to spread your bad news

4301779 personally i think norton is one of the most annoying programs ever created and its so hard to deal with
4301780 windows live onecare seemed to be over engineered and it created serious problems for us it seemed to randomly change the network settings on certain pcs without our knowledge and other so called brand name products were just as bad
4301781 our pcs are used for point of sale pos customer support and accounting so its vital that theyre fully protected pretty much every aspect of this business is dependent on our computers being up and running at all times a virus infection would effectively shut down the business
4301782 with a relatively small number of pcs hard costs are not a big issue for us
4301783 but soft costs like my time are extremely important so we really wanted to find an anti virus solution that would provide solid protection without needing a lot of administrative attention
4301784 through word of mouth i heard that some other small businesses were running avg and were very pleased with it
4301785 i decided to give it a try and contacted walling data online to talk about the product whether it would meet our needs and what pricing and licensing options wed be looking at
4301786 i sent walling data an email to get a price quote and we were happy with it
4301787 so i placed the order they helped us to deploy the software and it was all very quick and easy
4301788 i have had to take advantage of the free support a few times for minor things
4301789 walling data helped us to diagnose and fix the problems right then and there it was nice to be able to pick up the phone to solve an it problem on the spot especially considering the kind of time constraints i usually have
4301790 because we dont have a dedicated it department to handle software problems i was very happy to discover how easy avg was to manage
4301791 we have also found that avg doesnt have any impact on pc performance most of the time you dont even know its there and the price is fantastic
4301792 we were looking for something simple and unobtrusive that would keep our pcs secure without getting in our way and we found it in avg
4301793 the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves but rather detected
4301794 the real key to contentment and satisfaction is finding a purpose in life
4301795 the movement encourages positive world change from the inside out rather than from the outside in in my experience thats the only lasting route to positive global change
4301796 that scientific studies are showing the personal benefits of finding ones life purpose should be all the impetus needed to encourage millions of people to commit to finding their lives purpose
4301797 its great when one single government program can address three major national problems
4301798 that we only had 115 miles per hour winds trees were down power lines were down and a lot of minimal to moderate roof damage was suffered but we werent wiped out like the gulf coast during katrina
4301799 the problem of job loss expensive insurance and natural disasters is affecting many areas of our country
4301800 when i am elected to congress the first bill i will introduce will be the disaster mitigation and jobs creation act this bill will establish a low interest loan program to help homeowners in areas prone to floods hurricanes and wildfires harden their homes to these hazards in coastal areas this will include hardening the roofs and replacing windows with hurricane resistant windows capable of withstanding winds of 150 mph
4301801 this one can help many americans even taxpayers who end up paying for disaster relief as well as provide positive effects on the economy by putting hundreds of thousands of americans back to work
4301802 i am in favor of a national health program that guarantees that no american is denied needed care the disparity in our health care system is looking more like that in a third world country every day
4301803 while we work towards a national health system i have plans to fix some of the blatant problems that make our system unaffordable for so many
4301804 theyre exposed to it on the streets at school among their friends in the movies they watch the video games they play and the music they listen to g i m m i e was designed to break through the deceit found in this propaganda to expose these recruitment practices for what they really are lies
4301805 most kids are smarter than adults give them credit for
4301806 they just tend to have a limited attention span thats why the g i m m i e model was developed using the k i s s keep it short and simple principle to dissuade kids from joining gangs without them having to spend hours or days in a classroom learning about gang recruitment and violence where they might eventually lose interest
4301807 many people need to tighten their belts right now so theyre canceling gym memberships and saving on gas we kept that in mind when determining the price a soft economy doesnt have to equal a soft body
4301808 as the world reaches a threshold with modern science and its failures to provide for a relaxed functional state of mind people are turning to old and ancient methods to achieve that paradigm until now nobody created a scientific meditation that held solid ground reflecting its mechanism and therapeutic effects
4301809 in this age of technology humans are likely to be challenged by the very advancement they desire such as autonomy of computers to achieve certain solutions which some people will find hard to accept and deal with which in turn will be detrimental to self esteem and confidence
4301810 in that situation it is only the relaxed mind healthy body creativity awareness of self and following correct principles that can compete with the challenge of artificial intelligence and society at large cognitive therapies like dr ajrawats air pulse autonomic meditation therapy air pulse meditation and dr ajrawats image therapy will be the scientific tools to keep modern generations on the cutting edge

4301891 i was just serving up dinner and there he was at the window
4301892 you sure got a lot of bats in those caves mister
4301893 oh hi im looking for carter haven i rang the bell i wasnt sure if anyone was home
4301894 i should put a note on the door about the bell
4301895 its just i dont get many visitors so its never been important
4301896 im from ben wrights office he sent me over with some paperwork for you to sign
4301897 and then a son russell who is presumed dead but in fact it is not known whether he is dead or alive but well you probably know this better than i do but to my understanding he went missing after he was drafted and hasnt been heard from since
4301898 so because of his indeterminate status we need you to sign some additional papers since their wills didnt make any provisions regarding the possibility of russell returning and contesting your designation as sole beneficiary its extremely unlikely after all this time and i dont want to scare you its really just some standard paperwork where youll indicate you havent had any contact with russell that he hasnt approached you to try to make any claims that sort of thing
4301899 yeah yes well of course thats makes sense i can see sure
4301900 come in and make yourself comfortable im sorry im being so i just wasnt expecting all this you caught me a little off guard
4301901 i know i apologize i thought if i just stopped by with the papers it would be easier its on my way home you see i work in merrittville but i live in darby
4301902 it was good of you to stop by i appreciate it
4301903 hi its me im going to be late getting home can you make sure josie gets her dinner thanks no its nothing ill explain when i get home okay thanks chris bye
4301904 i dont want you to feel you have to i just thought that if you have to get home to your husband
4301905 im not married i was just calling my neighbor to see if she could feed my cat josie my cat shes diabetic has to eat at certain times shed probably be fine im just a worrier
4301906 i figured youd be in your forties or fifties somehow i had gotten the impression you were about the age the stokes children would have been
4301907 oh its a terribly boring story you dont want to hear it trust me
4301908 and while my mom was pregnant with me his grandmother died and he had to fly back to edinburgh for the funeral my mom couldnt fly at that point because it was so late in her pregnancy
4301909 on his way home dad stopped and visited a friend in london and while he was there he and mom were talking on the phone and get this he was calling her from a pay phone because he had gone for a walk and lost track of the time he didnt want to worry her by missing the time hed promised to call so he called collect can you imagine from a phone box
4301910 anyway they started discussing baby names they knew id be malcolm if i were a boy but they couldnt agree on a girls name
4301911 so while they were talking he said how about bromley and she said bromley bromley mcclemont i like it and when she asked him how he came up with that he told her im standing outside a store called russell amp bromley and because they both liked the idea of being four thousand miles apart and missing each other but still feeling this closeness while talking about their baby the name stuck
4301912 the funny thing is i usually dont bother with that whole story when people ask about my name i usually just tell them i was named after the borough of bromley in london
4301913 well im glad you told me the real story it makes your name that much more interesting
4301914 thats the non romantic part but it could explain why i am a compulsive shoe shopper
4301915 youre two whole presidents younger than me damn if i had been born in august instead of may i could say one but no
4301916 be thankful your parents chose a shoe store instead of a president then or youd be nixon mcclemont
4301917 and uh well im trying to learn how to cook
4301918 i read a lot too almost constantly if im honest
4301919 if i were home right now id probably be curled up on the couch with a microwaved dinner and a book
4301920 i know thats a bit like saying i love breathing because if you love literature it seems almost trite to verbalize loving dickens but i really do just adore him
4301921 i would be hard pressed to think of many books i like more than a tale of two cities
4301922 since were talking favorites or i am at any rate why dont we play fahrenheit 451 imagine its become reality and all our favorite books are being relegated to the flames which one book would you commit to memory for the sake of posterity and which would you feverishly shovel onto the pyre screaming burn you bastard burn at the top of your voice you first

4301978 many people dont realise but many of the australian wines that they buy in the shops and online for 15 per bottle or more is the same wine that goes into many export products which retail for over 25 per bottle overseas so much of the wine on offer with joos is premium quality at huge savings that has been a large factor in the early success of joos

4301983 back in 2002 mr ian smiley and i went to china with a bottle of home brewed and distilled moonshine at a local government welcome banquet we opened the bottle and passed the liquor around everyone liked the taste of it
4301984 it is almost like chinese traditional bai jiu white liquor but smoother and with a hint of sweetness immediately the head of the county mr jianguo han and mr guangqian hu wanted us to establish a distillery in their county they offered us tax incentives land usage license assistance right at the dinner table they made us an offer we simply could not refuse
4301985 liquor is a high tax revenue product for local provincial and the state government therefore they want the distillery
4301986 mr hu immediately pointed out that there is no chinese made whiskey on the market and all the imported whiskey aged in oak barrels has a strong oak taste which is very hard for chinese people to swallow he obviously recognized the high potential for moonshine whiskey in chinese market
4301987 china is a people country which means that the rules and regulations are often bent if the merit is evident the local government is willing to alter any regulations to push the project
4301988 my wife doesnt like the idea of producing moonshine and i am not a drinker
4301989 but mr han patiently pointed out to me that the moonshine project as the first whiskey distillery in china would bring not only employment to the local people but also boost the name recognition of his county and build its image attracting even more investment
4301990 if we can share 1 of the chinese liquor market we would be able to employ hundreds of people as well as spending millions of dollars at the local markets this would help local people tremendously since china is consuming about 4 9 billion liters 1 3 billion gallons of bai jiu white liquor a year
4301991 before the end of the year you will be able to bring a bottle of famous moonshine whiskey from china made from an appalachian recipe and distilled by a state of the art german distillery more than legally

4302046 no problem my word processor will catch all the mistakes for me
4302047 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4302048 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302049 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4302050 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4302051 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302052 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4302053 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302054 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302055 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302056 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4302057 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4302058 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4302059 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302060 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4302061 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4302062 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4302063 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4302064 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4302065 whats my contingency plan for scaring up cash in a hurry if i lost the house in a hurricane and the insurance company was playing hardball or if the only surgeon who could save my life werent in my hmo network
4302066 living as an addict of any kind is hard too hard much harder than being free

4302069 as marketers and agencies are under mounting pressure to justify marketing dollars they need to invest in understanding how to research and measure their interactive campaigns

4302071 were pleased to be partnering with emetrics to offer this course to their attendees
4302072 marketing staff and agencies need to understand that its much more than just measuring impressions and click thru rates and they need to be able to explain that to the c level executives attendees will leave this course knowing exactly what to measure and how to do it
4302073 the more you upload hot new files the more exposure you will give your banners and ads
4302074 the chaos theory tells us that chaotic systems are systems that look random but arent
4302075 business operations fundamentally prove this theory the chaos theory suggests that a butterfly flapping its wings in brazil could cause a tornado in texas known as the butterfly effect likewise in business an individuals actions can impact the performance of the entire business both in good and bad ways

4302086 lets see a tax cap would benefit workers many of whom are members of labor unions organized labor is against the tax cap i have been saying this for years the only people who benefit from labor unions are the officers and employees of labor unions the members do naot matter

4302088 get ready 2 rokk for those about 2 rokk mix
4302089 i just want to say youve got some nice legs
4302090 see some of them pr professionals er most of them are treating bloggers as just channels of message distribution were there to take the news they are pitching and regurgitate it and spit it at all of you that exercise is totally not interesting for all the reasons ive gone over here it doesnt let me figure out my own take on the story it doesnt let me hear from customers who are wildly happy it doesnt let me even figure out if the product works many of those kinds of stories are pitched to bloggers who dont even have any expertise in what they are pitching here do another exercise lets assume that stackoverflow was pitched to me by a pr company in an email would it have gotten coverage here no it doesnt let me really find my own voice or build an audience thats any different than anyone else on google reader or techmeme
4302091 every day i am deluged with hundreds of pr pitches they come from everywhere startups big companies competing pr firms and occasionally from people inside edelman where i work i read all the emails but delete 99 99 of them i dont even respond i feel bad about it but theyre so off base i cant even begin to tell you how bad they are however i cant fault these pr pros theyre doing their job they are doing what has always worked for them and i guess continues sending out lots of email pitches in hopes that some stick but those days are coming to an end
4302092 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the holy one is understanding

4302094 tu sei tu e nn c nessuno al mondo come te
4302095 its my process and ill cry if i want to
4302096 so irritated by it i want to make it go away
4302097 of course i want to be popular i want to eat thankyouverymuch
4302098 ladies and gentlemen this op ed in my hands says that the usgs has released a new exploratory study indicating that the artic region may hold 90 billion barrels of crude oil and a lot of natural gas
4302099 yes there is a projection that the region may also have 1 670 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas and 44 billion barrels of technically recoverable natural gas liquids in 25 geologically defined areas thought to have potential for petroleum
4302100 right senator dan these resources account for about 22 percent of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources in the world the arctic accounts for about 13 percent of the undiscovered oil 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas and 20 percent of the undiscovered natural gas liquids in the world about 84 percent of the estimated resources are expected to occur offshore according to the usgs report
4302101 well 90 billion barrels 80 million barrels per day 1000 days 3 4 years additional supply
4302102 finally it seems that the recent price rise was a bit of overkill and the market responded by consuming less gas bringing the price down should be a message in there for someone except the three year olds who want what they want when they want it and what they want is to drive their car at any expense to the planet they dont give a damn you see but they panic when the price goes up because got promised them that the price would never go up so it must be those damned environmentalists who made it go up
4302103 however by lessening our need for consuming so much foreign oil then we can hopefully decrease the market price by removing our demands from the foreign market maybe that will put incursions into georgia out of the cost benefit range of the russians
4302104 the question is not how much oil is in the ground rather the question is at what price can this oil be extracted the reason most of this oil is still there especially the shale oil is that it can not be profitably extracted at current market prices before i can understand the significance of any of the deposits i need to know what it costs to get it out of the ground if it cost 200 bbl to extract shale oil it is not relevant that we have large shale deposits peak oil does not mean that we are running out of oil we will never run out of oil rather what it means is that we are running out of cheap oil that is a very different thing
4302105 bravo mr director was gonna say the same general thing but you did it better thanks
4302106 oil oil oil there are other methods of powering our civilization without the attendant damage that oil does to our world oh yes chairman therapist1 better read some more on the russian georgian conflict and find out who was the original aggressor in all of it
4302107 yep lots of cheap oil to be had out west
4302108 there is also the so called energy cost as well it is possible to imagine a scenario where extraction is relatively cheap but that it takes more than one barrel of oil to process a barrel of oil if that happens it doesnt matter how cheap or expensive bringing the final product to market is my guess is that in the future stuff like this will be processed by nuclear energy we can synthesize light crude right now using the fischer tropsch process but for the present it is uneconomic to do so i suspect that the future is going to be this route for automobiles batteries just dont seem to cut it without a change in urban suburban planning
4302109 if one wants to avoid the impression of sloganeering one should avoid a sloganeering tone refuting a watered down version of the other sides argument is also necessary if one wants to be taken seriously this piece gets both of these wrong the first paragraph trivializes objections to arctic oil extraction thats fine if you are preaching to co religionists but this isnt the nro or wsj editorial page to sway those who dont already share the dogma you have to actually address the subtleties of the other sides views in short were not running out of oil were swimming in it
4302110 instead of throwing around words which ultimately are gratuitous for both
4302111 this is just two areas in the us not even considering worldwide potential there are plenty of hydrocarbons available to fuel civilization almost to the point that investment or technological breakthroughs would release a flood of cheap oil that would wipe out all kinds of investments
4302112 as soon as there is a way to make energy cheap and abundant it will become cheap and abundant
4302113 knowing that there is that much oil out there where do you run your investment analysis at 120 barrel or 50 barrel im at 50 and there is a lot less investment at 50 than at 120
4302114 any chance this could become a peer reviewed publication having started out with a marketing piece for his own position senator sammy is studiously avoiding answering the substance of questions which he cannot comfortably answer and picking oil prices out of the air this piece was advertized as an editorial whats the point of running editorials if that is what is needed to substitute unsupported opinion for analysis then maybe editorials are a bad idea
4302115 and you always like my press conferences senator dan thoughtfully brought along the usgs press release supporting the alaska oil segment i dont think the shale data is in dispute although the posters are right there are currently barriers to production i just thought that the investor business daily op ed provided a good and provocative summary maybe it detracts but heck many of the liberal positions are just pulled from other liberals why the differing standard here mr editor
4302116 90 billion barrels 80 million barrels per day 1000 days 3 4 years additional supply
4302117 walker the u s consumes about 21 mil bpd so that would give us if we didnt share about 12 years but thats assuming we pumped ourselves 21 mil bpd from alaska the current pipeline we have in alaska has capacity for about 1 5 mil bpd but only pumps about half that i dont know if we could pump that much out of alaska if we tried i think it would surely jack costs higher how much oil could alaskans pump if alaskans could pump oil
4302118 we should let russia develop the arctic fields and then buy oil and gas from them
4302119 thank you mg see you tomorrow and now a word from our sponsor
4302120 if you can learn to get over some of the obstacles on a chess board you can get over some of the obstacles in life
4302121 it forces you to think in difficult situations you cant just react
4302122 if not theyll start their own activities and sometimes its not what you want
4302123 i was told by my adoptive parents that i joined them as a family member as an infant and my biological dad was different and not like the rest of us those remarks often caused me to fantasise and wonder about just me who my birth dad really was a monster a member of the traveling circus
4302124 it was like meeting myself 30 years ago hes got a different talent but same drive and passion and certainly the same sense of humor
4302125 obviously if i knew he was going to be this successful i would have kept him
4302126 hes a guy that was physically tortured for five and a half years in vietnam had his bones broken and nobody reset them he reset his own arms his arms still dont work right because when they snapped his bones there was no doctor to reset his bones for him
4302127 we all have so much fun together im so lucky my dad and ashton get along its not weird theres no jealousy or drama if we werent all entirely morally opposed to doing a reality show i guarantee it would be the best selling reality show ever
4302128 sometime when i wasnt doing music for six months dennis came along and picked up on the band and stole them from me
4302129 the next time i was ready to do a concert i called up my band master and he said we cant play because were going to an undisclosed location in the persian gulf on an aircraft carrier playing for the troops
4302130 i said how did you book that i want that gig he said dennis knows this general and thats how it happened
4302131 thats how i found out dennis had my band and i had to go and get another band and train them all over again
4302132 dennis is an old friend of mine were like family friends
4302133 i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvellous engraver in 07 i put it in a travelling case and i hadnt travelled
4302134 my road manager came over and said do you have a gun in your bag i said no are you crazy i said i know what ive packed jeff he said really whats that there
4302135 then it all flashed a whole year flashed on me
4302136 if i knew it was there id have hid it better
4302137 you dont do that travel with a gun its just not something that a gun owner fools with you know better
4302138 we went up to one of these newsstand guys and he said i have one left i hid it in the back it was awesome
4302139 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
4302140 were so excited we just told the family this past monday they thought it was great news i couldnt hide it any more the second time you show faster
4302141 i point to my belly and tell her theres a baby in my belly
4302142 stranger things have happened you know that stuff does happen right so i dont know well see what happens i have a wonderful wife who is very capable and who knows maybe well have a surprise
4302143 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4302144 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4302145 its a terribly sad time for esther shes staying away from all her old buddies because she doesnt want to worry anyone
4302146 as i told you after my first match im just looking to find my rhythm which i found tonight
4302147 i was happy to not spend too much time on the court
4302148 my arm gets really tired and i cant practice as much
4302149 i played some balls deep into the corners and down the middle and she didnt have a chance to step up and play her game
4302150 he cares about his on court performance more than he ever has in his life
4302151 whatever adelman needs me to do come off the bench be the sixth or seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4302152 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4302153 we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far
4302154 we cant do anything but have a yes vote because of the importance that this will hold for this community now and well into the future
4302155 for instance medical physics this is an area that might be interesting for us to pursue a little bit more it has nothing to do with nuclear power but it uses the same basic principles and techniques
4302156 during a period called the medieval warm period the climate also go very very warm and one of our findings for instance in the north pacific is that it was a devastating time for many sea mammal populations
4302157 we will be working with dna snags hair hair tissue snags as well as camera trap lines and so forth in an effort to get this evidence
4302158 we would never put a new pilot in a plane without having spent inordinate numbers of hours in the simulator well such is the similar concept with the human patient simulator
4302159 its not a conventional shop but theyre real bagels theyre real new york water boiled bagels
4302160 i think its a cool idea to have another choice of places to eat in idaho falls
4302161 not only that theyre fresh made homemade bagels and all of the ingredients are natural in them including the smoothies but the fact that they use completely 100 compatible products really impresses me
4302162 everything about this bus is green we use biodegradable plastics low v o c paint and a lot of recyclable materials
4302163 everybody whose ate here said that its the best bagels theyve had since in a long time
4302164 i love it the bus is colorful attention grabbing absolutely a great idea
4302165 v enfiar uma serra el trica na sua bunda mas toma cuidado pra n o perder ela l dentro
4302166 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4302167 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4302168 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4302169 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4302170 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4302171 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4302172 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4302173 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4302174 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4302175 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4302176 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4302177 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4302178 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4302179 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4302180 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4302181 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4302182 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4302183 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4302184 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4302185 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4302186 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4302187 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4302188 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4302189 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4302190 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4302191 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4302192 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4302193 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4302194 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4302195 reported thursday that the nba franchise that will start playing in oklahoma city in the upcoming season announced their ticket pricing structure
4302196 its just hard to be the brain of the body of christ
4302197 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of
4302198 unbelievable im still shaking ive never seen anything like this before
4302199 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4302200 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4302201 you hold out hope that bigfoot will be found one day hopefully it wouldnt unfold in such a carnival atmosphere and the proper authorities and scientists would be involved
4302202 that means you re an idiot and you re not a man at all

4302216 observ que la federaci n de rusia amparada en los acuerdos internacionales que legitiman la presencia de sus fuerzas de paz en osetia del sur actu para preservar la vida de la poblaci n suroseta as como la de sus connacionales
4302217 amante de la paz y ferviente defensor de los derechos humanos aboga por que los pasos dados conduzcan a una paz duradera en osetia del sur y en toda la regi n del c ucaso
4302218 los pa ses de europa a no permitir que actores externos pongan en riesgo la estabilidad del continente europeo y la paz del mundo
4302219 i really wish i was more geeky i love microsoft
4302220 yo espero que el senado rechace el proyecto es evidente que si se sigue manteniendo este sistema consigui ndose un voto por aqu y un voto por all nunca se va a arreglar el problema por eso debemos tener una posici n firme en el parlamento
4302221 negociar votos en esta forma podr a ser el comienzo de un muy mal camino
4302222 los vecinos no saben nada no han recibido ninguna notificaci n oficial no saben si quiera si van a conservar su casa o su fuente de trabajo yo creo que as como se dise el transantiago a espaldas de la gente y sin preocuparse de las personas esta situaci n demuestra una insensibilidad tremenda
4302223 parece mentira que las pongan s lo para los ricos
4302224 esta idea est bien todos los ni os tienen los mismos derechos pero debemos garantizar que a la vez se promocionen los acogimientos de los ni os canarios nosotros sacamos adelante muchas adopciones internacionales pero no debemos olvidarnos de las nuestras hay que fomentarlas de manera conjunta
4302225 son muy eficientes han conseguido agilizar los tr mites es la jurisprudencia la que va lenta si se fomenta el acogimiento de los menores extranjeros el trabajo volver acumularse y de nuevo sufrir n las esperas interminables tanto las familias adoptantes como para los ni os
4302226 se trata de una experiencia nueva tendremos que esperar a que la administraci n trabaje la iniciativa no podemos augurar lo que pasar porque no lo sabemos s lo espero que no se convierta como pas con algunas de las adopciones de ni os chinos en una tendencia snob que la gente se ofrezca porque se pone de moda
4302227 es un gesto que aliviar la situaci n en el archipi lago que perjudicaba especialmente a la atenci n que recib an dada la masificaci n de los centros
4302228 la inmigraci n es un problema de mbito internacional aunque afecte m s directamente a las comunidades que son fronteras con el continente africano
4302229 son las comunidades las que tiene las competencias sobre menores
4302230 de ah que este asunto no haya sido solucionado antes porque el gobierno central al no poder imponer la tutela de estos ni os
4302231 el compromiso de este gobierno y de su presidente es resolver el concurso entre lo que queda del mes de agosto y septiembre
4302232 sabe que el concurso e lico va a salir bien y va a salir ya
4302233 est generando una alarma social que no existe ni entre la sociedad canaria ni entres los promotores de energ a e lica
4302234 no vamos a permitir que se ponga en duda su profesionalidad
4302235 y de eso no dicen nada el partido socialista ni el cabildo de gran canaria ni el estado a la hora de decidir d nde van las centrales de gas
4302236 la chapuza del gobierno de canarias que despu s de 11 meses a n sigue sin resolver el segundo concurso e lico
4302237 los nuevos parques e licos no estar n en funcionamiento antes de 2011
4302238 el gobierno se inventa esta situaci n excepcional porque considera que el ordenamiento es como un chicle que puede adaptarse a su conveniencia o a su ineficaz pesada y lenta maquinaria administrativa
4302239 es que se est en una situaci n excepcional calificada as por el incumplidor
4302240 echa la culpa a los funcionarios con tal de tapar con todo el descaro la tremenda incompetencia del desgobierno que venimos sufriendo los canarios desde julio de 2007 cuando los funcionarios de industria son de los mejor preparados de todas las consejer as

4302247 no va a regatear esfuerzos a su alcance y va a tomar medidas dentro de sus posibilidades
4302248 preservaremos ante todo la pol tica social como el eje fundamental
4302249 el gobierno viene adoptando medidas desde el primer d a de legislatura
4302250 en los frentes en los que se manifiesta el frenazo
4302251 tenemos una deuda sobre el pib que nos permite seguir lanzando est mulos a la econom a
4302252 vamos a mantener el compromiso de incremento de las pensiones m nimas y del salario m nimo

4302256 a una situaci n que tiene sus elementos de posibles cambios
4302257 la verdad es que en carnaval casi todo es un plagio
4302258 no es igual a ninguna otra y por ello ha pasado ya todos los filtros de la sociedad general de autores
4302259 no tenemos ning n problema porque la versi n que vamos a contratar a partir de enero no tiene nada que ver con la de ni pico ni corto porque adem s nos la ha vendido mdanza
4302260 recibi cerca de 25 000 euros por componer la canci n del carnaval
4302261 espa oles sin sangre caliente que no tienen salero como ellos
4302262 todos los puntos han partido desde la patronal por lo que no entienden como se ha podido firmar
4302263 no pueden coger este permiso para trabajar en la misma profesi n en el mbito insular mientras los dem s niveles s que pueden
4302264 indiscriminaci n a n siendo que los niveles 1 y 2 obtienen informaci n privilegiada cuando eso no es verdad
4302265 la combinaci n y la participaci n de cada una de las fuentes de energ a para asegurar el suministro el ctrico en la isla ya est n previstas y calculadas han colaborado con nosotros para hacer estos c lculos socios locales nacionales e internacionales
4302266 tenemos un proyecto i d en desarrollo para demostrar que eso es t cnicamente posible y adem s m s barato que los gastos para generar la misma cuantidad de energ a el ctrica mediante combustibles f siles como se est haciendo en canarias actualmente
4302267 es la pol tica que hace el gobierno de madrid antes de las elecciones dijeron que quer an apoyar fuertemente las energ as renovables y lo que nos presentan ahora es un borrador para un nuevo real decreto sobre las tarifas de la energ a solar fotovoltaica previsto para entrar en vigor el d a 28 de septiembre de 2008
4302268 conviven bien y nadie se ofende porque aunque no se permiten cambios hemos ido a adiendo novedades como la narraci n de la leyenda por c sar trujillo para que los espectadores la entiendan mejor
4302269 la actual situaci n econ mica se agudiza entre los trabajadores aut nomos canarios
4302270 la actual situaci n de crisis que est atravesando la econom a espa ola afirma juan carlos arricivita presidente de la asociaci n de trabajadores aut nomos de canarias se hace latente entre los aut nomos canarios con unos datos que nos muestran el aumento de un 16 7 en el n mero de aut nomos que han causado baja en su actividad aunque las bajas pueden ser por diferentes motivos contrasta que el pasado a o y con estos mismos motivos hubo 1 500 bajas menos
4302271 se trata de uno de los espect culos favoritos de mi carrera por no decir el que m s ya que est dedicado a los flamencos y en especial a mi madre concha baras adem s hemos intentado colorear nuestros sentimientos
4302272 es muy importante no perder la ilusi n estar siempre aprendiendo intentar superarse y entregar cada d a un poco m s ya que eso se refleja en el escenario
4302273 los a os nos han favorecido tanto a m como a mi compa a con la que ya llevo diez a os
4302274 es como una gran familia en la que todos disfrutamos con lo que hacemos y de la que aprendemos unos de otros aunque he tenido mucha suerte porque mi carrera ha sido muy intensa todav a me quedamucho por aprender
4302275 hay muy buenos artistas aunque no tengo la suerte de poder ver a los compa eros muy a menudo ya que los teatros siempre descansan los lunes
4302276 el flamenco es un arte que sin coraz n no vale necesita t cnica y de muchas horas de estudio para multiplicar los sentimientos y eso lo convierte en algo diferente lo m s importante es sentir y dejarse llevar
4302277 en los sentimientos de su protagonista porque es lo que a m me llama la atenci n y porque es lo que deber amos hacer todos hay un momento en el que se busca la verdad y es entonces cuando te das cuenta de que la verdad viene del coraz n
4302278 con las tres porque cada una tiene su cosita y adem s las tres coinciden en anteponer sus sentimientos
4302279 me viene muy bien como int rprete ya que me hace cambiar el chip y me permite dejarme llevar y eso siempre se agradece el arte tiene que tener movimiento para poder inspirarte

4302288 al parecer aqu alguien ha descubierto de pronto que las canciones de las murgas son casi siempre copiadas
4302289 al parecer algunos no han digerido que los pasados carnavales fueron todo un xito
4302290 no podemos decir si la canci n es una copia o no no somos responsables de determinarlo
4302291 la clave de todo es que el proceso estar totalmente automatizado por lo que no se requerir la presencia de una persona especializada

4302295 his first role is to come in and contribute on special teams
4302296 but the reason i like him on top of that is if something was to happen to peterson and or taylor you can trust that he will go in and play he can truly come in and help you and not lose a beat

4302298 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4302299 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4302300 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4302301 something like this cyanide find is very different to me it looks like they stumbled upon something that could have been in its operational stage convention two weeks away and all

4302341 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4302342 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4302343 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4302344 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4302345 it bothered me going up and down the stairs and it bothered me walking
4302346 wow i thought that it would be only half as bad
4302347 what the robot does is it allow us to put those parts in a very precise and accurate manner every single time for every single patient
4302348 theyve been pretty much a free hand operation the surgeons are eye balling where to put the part to put them in
4302349 the success rate of implanting the parts in a perfect position for the patient should be a 100 percent for this

4302359 say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty that will make for greater purity for them and allah is well acquainted with all that they do
4302360 and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof that they should draw veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands their fathers their husbands fathers their sons

4302362 i make it a point to cover all of the 67 counties and will be having town meetings during the august recess
4302363 i plan to spend the bulk of the town hall meeting taking questions from constituents to find out what is on peoples minds and to bring people up to date on what is going on in washington i find it indispensible to stay in close touch with the people of pennsylvania in order to do as good a job as possible in representing them
4302364 russias aggression is not only about toppling a pro western democracy and potential nato member its about the only pipeline bringing caspian sea oil to the west not controlled by moscow or iran
4302365 one of the russian targets in georgia is a pipeline carrying oil from the caspian to the west
4302366 another pipeline the south caucasus pipeline will carry natural gas along the same route it has a capacity of 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year and is needed to get turkmenistans vast natural gas reserves to european customers

4302369 why wont you permit a straight up or down vote
4302370 but if you feel you have the better arguments why not give a straight up or down vote for drilling
4302371 well if youre right why not let it be debated out and have the vote
4302372 when you came in as speaker you promised in your commitment book a new direction for america let me show our viewers you said that bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives if they want to offer a drilling proposal why cant they have a vote
4302373 do it all do it now do it for america
4302374 speaker pelosi a staunch opponent of offshore drilling has simply decreed that she will not allow a drilling vote to take place if drilling opponents really have the better of this argument why are they so worried about letting it come to a vote

4302376 every year i have the honor of nominating arkansas finest students for the privilege of attending one of the academies and the decision gets tougher every year
4302377 admission to our nations service academies is reserved for those students most prepared for the rigorous academic and physical challenges that await them i look forward to seeing the graduates from these academies lead our nation to great successes in the future
4302378 throughout my travels in southern indiana this august constituents have repeatedly expressed their concerns over unrelenting gas prices
4302379 it is time congress responds with both short and long term strategies
4302380 i enjoy taking time to travel throughout the second congressional district to meet people and learn about their businesses and organizations firsthand
4302381 i believe during these difficult economic times it is more important than ever to be accessible to my constituents
4302382 working together we will build an energy independent future for all of us
4302383 investing in renewable energy while practicing energy conservation and efficiency will reduce our dependence on foreign oil i want to make it easier and more affordable for utilities businesses and homes to run on solar power
4302384 solar energy is an investment in our future in the short term there are several things we should do to relieve high gas prices i have called on the president several times to sell 10 of the strategic petroleum reserve which would instantly increase the supply of oil and reduce prices at the pump more rapidly than anything else
4302385 i wanted to see if i could make myself energy independent i thought it was a good thing to do i found that it is possible to do it with limited funds i want more people to know what is possible if you decide to do what you can to help
4302386 the only thing i want to go to the gas station for is cheese and milk
4302387 the long term economic potential of makes this an extremely important market for video games

4302391 i applaud the efforts of chairman miller and the members of the 110
4302392 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
4302393 we welcome the people and the colleagues of the olympic games with us and we welcome suggestions that are constructive advice from these people all kinds of peoples but the foreign press you come here to pick critically dig into details but that doesnt mean we dont fulfil on our promises i did not say china would promise to do whatever i did say the games would open up the horizons of china
4302394 and i think that maybe theyre like we dont show up which is what i guess front runner means theyre only on your side when youre winning
4302395 there are definitely games dont get me wrong where im like damn you know we are getting booed and we need to get booed because were not doing well
4302396 the whole thing was look here we are in the playoffs were at home were in first place theres really nothing to boo about were not going to win every game as long as we win by one when it comes down to the finish but go out there and support us when carlos ruiz comes up to the plate dont boo him because you want chris coste in the game this man has a job to do today encourage him to do his job to the best of his abilities
4302397 the term front runner and what it actually means and to what i was using it what was going through my mind they werent accurate front runners is like people who only show up when youre winning hey were going to cheer you if you win thats not it about philly fans theyre passionate they show up like i said 45 000 weve got like 42 sellouts they announce it everynight thats not what i meant like i said its the fact that here we are at this point of the year come out and be supportive dont necessarily get on us we can use that positve energy and you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down
4302398 its one of those cities i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example
4302399 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4302400 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4302401 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4302402 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4302403 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter

4302405 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4302406 one of the most purely entertaining hamlets i have ever seen
4302407 its the chance to rub shoulders with these really intelligent writers and publishers and to talk about books that you care deeply about

4302416 my hand is the extension of the thinking process the creative process
4302417 the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance
4302418 the essence of all art is to have pleasure in giving pleasure
4302419 the idea of idds is to find simple solutions to big problems

4302425 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4302426 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4302427 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4302428 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4302429 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4302430 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4302431 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine

4302459 hes a tower of strength in terms of his physical appearance and also his ability around the track i rate him as a pretty special athlete he just needs a little bit more time
4302460 not over enjoying myself off the field but also on the field doing my homework doing the basics right and not going outside of my role
4302461 my role is pretty simple really you hit rucks and mauls you run a lineout and you push in the scrum and when you can you tackle
4302462 when you try to overcomplicate it the little head starts playing games and you think you should start doing other things
4302463 i feel well i dont know how to feel at this point besides extremely excited its cool how someone people can just stumble upon your music and say hey i like it and i wanna put it on the cd that my company puts out

4302467 shoot her in the left boob no no no the right boob
4302468 i dont know if its because we are an interracial couple and we have a mixed family
4302469 so it was a group of people not just one
4302470 it mostly referenced the racial and not a specific gang
4302471 we have come a long way but theres still a little bit of a way to go
4302472 i try to ignore racial slurs but it does mess up my day for a while
4302473 its like a pink elephant thats in the room but everyone acts like its not there and everyone says dont talk about it
4302474 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4302475 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4302476 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4302477 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4302478 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer

4302483 i say uuhhhhh we are not jusht what you call underdogs
4302484 record labels have been screwing us for so long with high cd prices and albums with only one or two good songs those record exec fatcats with their expense accounts and private jets they deserve this im just sticking it to the man
4302485 after assessing this situation we believe this was a criminal attack deliberately targeting innocent iraqi civilians our condolences go out to the victims and to their families
4302486 militants are trying to drive a wedge between the citizens of eastern baghdad and the legal iraq security forces that provide their security they must stand as one to fight militant criminals who want to do them harm and destroy their hopes for a better more peaceful future
4302487 the soldiers of the 1st brigade are committed to assisting the iraqi security forces in their ongoing security missions in the rashid district of baghdad
4302488 we are aggressively pursuing aqi and small groups criminals in the rashid district the people of rashid continue to provide information in defeating the enemy and trust the isf and with their support we will continue to deny the enemy a safe haven in baghdad
4302489 we are thrilled judge king has recognized the hard work and dedication of the parties who have worked tirelessly over the past few years to reach this agreement
4302490 through this agreement the parties recognize each others roles and responsibilities at the fisheries management table we recognize that we are all co managers of the columbia river fishery and are dedicated to working together on the responsible management of that fishery for tribal and non tribal interests for the next seven generations
4302491 with these agreements fish harvest hatchery operations and hydropower facilities all will be consistently managed under a framework that supports our shared goals of recovering wild salmon populations
4302492 the agreements principles and actions complement salmon management in the recently approved 10 year pacific salmon treaty accord and other statewide objectives
4302493 with this agreement we can now focus our efforts on the management of the columbia river fisheries
4302494 working together ia and mnd b soldiers removed these dangerous weapons from the streets of baghdad
4302495 each weapon we remove from the area helps to safeguard the local populace

4302498 its very similar to what they do on the battlefield
4302499 you look out for your buddy so let us look out for our buddy in other ways as well
4302500 i believe that that is 1 800 people who would not have come forward otherwise
4302501 those 1 800 people got counseling medical care and assistance
4302502 i would go as far to say that the program is only as good as the sexual assault response coordinator
4302503 this is a command program and we have to have command support for this program to work
4302504 where we see it work best is when the sexual assault response coordinator and the commander work in unison
4302505 yea bitch its all about dat top8gang all da fxck dayy i fxcks wit my nigga tom comment my blog fore i beat yo ass

4302511 the ip station has been functioning for the past four months but has not been recognized by the government of iraq until today
4302512 the iraqis now have a local police force to protect the people and handle the routine activities and business related to security here in radwaniyah
4302513 this opening today is a great day and marks a new beginning for the government of iraq and the people of radwaniyah
4302514 we have a very tight bond with the people of radwaniyah the tribal support council and the u s army and coalition forces work hand in hand to provide security for this area
4302515 the radwaniyah security forces of the rashid district worked with the good people of radwaniyah to achieve sustainable security and we see that here today with the opening of the police station
4302516 after youve been everywhere else and get to see what everything else is like im pretty pumped to be coming back
4302517 working with other nations is one of the most exciting parts of this mission
4302518 the thing we all have in common though is that we all want to help
4302519 were recognizing the compelling nature of the challenges were facing from climate change pandemic the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction economic inequalities one of the objectives of the conference was to create a forum for researchers to build collaborative relationships in order to address the kinds of challenges that no nation can solve alone
4302520 we were all very familiar with the literature but what we wanted to do was have an even higher level opportunity to interact directly and work
4302521 we are not part of the solution we are part of the problem itself and we will alienate locals and create insurgents faster than we can eliminate them
4302522 to win the long war we must adopt an approach that will build trust
4302523 in terms of problem solving for the challenges the country confronts it is very rewarding to get to work with system engineers modelers operations researchers and people from other disciplines because when we combine and effectively communicate we really can enhance the global effort
4302524 the goal was to come aboard and work as a team with different nations
4302525 its all about coming together to help the locals who are less fortunate
4302526 its been a different experience working with the new zealanders but a good one ive never had the chance to work with people outside of the united states before
4302527 theyre all pretty eager to work with us as well and its nice to have ambitious people around
4302528 its been such a cool experience working here with all these people
4302529 pacific partnership is very productive and obviously has the potential to do a lot of good which it does
4302530 i was a little skeptical when i first came aboard but i think what theyre doing is good simple and decisive treatment that can change peoples lives
4302531 mercys gone out of their way to show us around and make sure we have everything we need said konlechner
4302532 its wonderful to be recognized and the fact that the region commands received the awards really demonstrates our leadership support and the personnel support were getting on our energy awareness efforts
4302533 federal legislation mandates require each command to reduce energy consumption by three percent annually
4302534 the region continuously implements energy efficient projects and promotes energy award initiatives to help reduce our consumption
4302535 being recognized by secnav as a leader in energy and water management is a result of the highest level of leadership excellence and is a tremendous accomplishment
4302536 everyones work has helped reduce the use of valuable natural resources and enabled navy region hawaii to meet federally mandated requirements for energy reduction these actions help reinforce the navys image as a good steward of our nations resources
4302537 it means you are the best ship in the atlantic fleet simply put
4302538 it is not just about battle efficiency it is not just about retention its not about navigation its not about administration
4302539 it is all of that put together thats what makes it unique and thats what makes it special
4302540 you joined the navy you were put on a ship in a crew with a lot of heritage and a lot of tradition you are the oldest ship but also the best ship and that is truly unique
4302541 to tell you that i am proud of you would be an absolutely gross understatement
4302542 you earned this your blood sweat and tears are what got you this cup
4302543 nswc cranes eme system augments the native eme at the test site to provide an environment that we can realistically find in the intended areas of operation for these systems
4302544 obviously program managers would like to find and correct issues during testing and not after fielding we provide the eme generation system integration into a trailer the cooling and the antenna mast components of the system
4302545 were not doing this to build up our egos if anything its going to deflate them
4302546 it was kind of an afterthought jeff and i thought hey it would be cool to climb fuji three times and we thought while making these plans we might as well do it for charity it makes a lot of sense
4302547 last year we got up to like 500 then we were thinking hey we can get up to 1 000 blew right past 1 000 dollars and it kind of grew exponentially without us really doing anything thats why we thought this year 10 000 was obtainable
4302548 ive been in japan for a couple of tours now ive climbed mt fuji a few times and ive raced up it a couple of times i was looking for a new miserable experience and this fits the bill
4302549 im sure were going to be challenged both physically and mentally its definitely going to be a test of our endurance but this event isnt about us or mt fuji its about the kids
4302550 i remember coming to play foosball basketball and bumper pool growing up
4302551 having the club helped me to make smart choices about staying in school and staying drug free
4302552 what a great program the club is giving to the community
4302553 even though school hasnt started for chicago the children have a safe place to go and be inspired
4302554 we are interested in tapping into all the science and technology we can find wherever the best stuff is onr wants to go get it
4302555 this is about relevant research and taking that great science we discover and turning that into capability in the hands of the warfighters
4302556 there are rapidly emerging threats which we must be able to respond quickly developing the technology which will allow us early detection and counter these threats will be truly critical to our ability to defend our homeland
4302557 we enjoy performing with spirit of america because we support the troops
4302558 it is an amazing thing to do we usually have more fun on the military bases than any where else
4302559 i am enjoying the show i didnt know thornton was a musician just an actor i think it is great when they come here and perform for the troops
4302560 naval station great lakes is one of my favorite places to visit because when i look at the faces of the navys newest sailors i know america is in the best of hands
4302561 my father was a navy fireman he was on a cruiser and destroyer he was wounded in the korean war and he reminded me of it almost every day
4302562 we would not be here enjoying freedom today if not for the efforts of our u s navy sailors
4302563 the navy serves america in the defense of freedom and theres no greater satisfaction to bringing another person into the service
4302564 we give thanks to cities like chicago for when our sailors deploy overseas your teachers medical personnel police and other community organizations help their spouses and children continue their lives and take pride in their loved ones service
4302565 not far from here just off the highway that was once the showpiece of the united states reconstruction effort in afghanistan three american soldiers and their afghan interpreter were ambushed and killed seven weeks ago the soldiers two of them members of the national guard from new york died as their vehicles were hit by mines and rocket propelled grenades at least one was dragged off and chopped to pieces according to afghan and western officials the body was so badly mutilated that at first the military announced that it had found the remains of two men not one in a nearby field
4302566 one man pulled out a small caliber gun and fired one shot
4302567 that bullet struck hill a couple of his friends took him outside and drove him to health central in ocoee where he was pronounced dead
4302568 the casings inside the building and the ones outside were different calibers
4302569 when the computer was first built its inventors did not have telephony in mind nor was it even on the horizon
4302570 jajah combined with intels remote wake capability brings the industry closer to a global ip based telephony system with simple to use functionality and advanced environmental friendliness
4302571 we are pleased to add people of franks and johns caliber to our board
4302572 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in biondi is currently working as a senior managing director at equity firm waterview advisers he is also on the board of directors at seagate cablevision systems and hasbro chapple works at equity firm hawkeye investments and is on the board of directors at several telco firms the two will work with icahn to help yahoos board move beyond its feud with microsoft and subsequent shareholder rebellion when talks of a possible acquisition by the redmond software giant fell through a group of investors lead by icahn called for the removal of the entire board even after the company struck a deal with icahn many investors remained upset over the boards actions at the companys recent annual meeting only two thirds of shareholders voted to re elect chairman roy bostock and chief executive jerry yang yang expressed support for both of the new directors on thursday emphasizing yahoos future plans has our unique combination of a global brand the industrys best talent innovative technologies and exceptional assets

4302575 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications
4302576 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4302577 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4302578 if it happens at the wrong time it could cause a serious accident and the fact that you were distracted at the time could mean the difference between serious injury and a fatal accident
4302579 the government is committed to continually improving safety on britains roads
4302580 under the road safety act we have already brought in tougher penalties for drivers who use hand held mobile phones at the wheel and the introduction of these new offences today is the latest step to tackle bad driving and further improve safety on our roads
4302581 maybe its a good thing i didnt go direct to amsterdam after all
4302582 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4302583 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4302584 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4302585 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4302586 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4302587 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4302588 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4302589 we bombed them because we dont like them wish there was more to it than that but we just decided they aint us so screw em
4302590 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
4302591 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
4302592 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
4302593 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
4302594 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
4302595 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
4302596 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
4302597 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
4302598 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
4302599 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
4302600 fedex kinkos just sounds silly fedex office is much more proffessional
4302601 i dont give a shit about the environment anything this feels good is good its now
4302602 though we have no information of his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts his name had cropped up days after the jaipur blasts
4302603 as i have said many times there can be no revolution in military affairs without having a revolution in military logistics
4302604 te necesito para estar mejor y aliviarme del antojo que tengo
4302605 papa moi jhabiterai dans une ville une avec des grands immeubles et plein de gens dedans
4302606 drinking and smoking while riding is for professionals only do not attempt
4302607 it seems normal to do things that still strike other parts of the country as awfully different
4302608 we never considered renting a car because its so compact and easy to get around
4302609 work watch football games and send live information to people
4302610 requirement basic understanding of football rules no professional background needed advantage if you have a car
4302611 anyone want a 50 hr job uk based football information company looking for live information from the mexican league
4302612 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4302613 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4302614 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
4302615 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
4302616 we want to teach kids they can have fun in their neighborhood
4302617 people in the city seem to think their water is polluted and doesnt have anything in it
4302618 a bird does not sing because it has an answer it sings because it has a song
4302619 hark now hear the sailors cry smell the sea and feel the sky let your soul amp spirit fly into the mystic
4302620 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4302621 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4302622 its another opportunity to show that you can play and that you have to be you have to go out there and be consistent and make the improvements on what happened in the last game and show youre growing each day in practice
4302623 its another opportunity to go out there and play as well as i can
4302624 we are using this time in the preseason practice and in the games to evaluate our people
4302625 focus in and take advantage of the reps i get and try to get the most out of them
4302626 thats all i can do and do the best i can im going to go out there and focus in try to take advantage of it not worry about the group i am in there with or who im going against just worry about my responsibilities going out there and executing
4302627 for my family and obviously his family itll be good to get down there and see a lot of people his old friends and family and deal with it its been difficult for everybody
4302628 the preseason is still is the preseason but im excited about driving to the game myself and knowing where to park
4302629 i thought that was it for me after my last college game but there was an agent who took a chance on me peter schaffer he introduced me to a trainer in denver and i went out there for about 3 months and we trained twice a day i knew larry fitzgerald was going to work out at pitt for his pro day and so i figured out i could work out then and there would be a very good audience i felt all i had to do was take care of what i had to take care of and put up good numbers i think i had a heck of a workout and i think it opened the eyes of a lot of football scouts and they went back and started watching tape its hard to think you can get lost after starting for four straight years but i was able to put up good numbers and ended up getting drafted on the first day
4302630 its chaotic but at this point in my life i dont feel any stress
4302631 this is the calmest ive ever been in my life the calmest my life has ever been ive got a job that ive always wanted to do i have a great girl weve got four crazy kids and this is just the calmest our lives have been
4302632 we liked the name and since the meaning fit with the peace and calm we feel in our lives we went with it
4302633 it was the toughest point of my career of playing football
4302634 my first three years i felt like i put up very good numbers and that i had proved i was a starter so to go from 80 plays a game to only 20 thats not a good feeling it was hard for me and often i felt like id go anywhere else and play for free just so i was playing i didnt blame anyone and i understood the organization did what they felt was best for the team but it didnt make it any easier for me because i wanted to be out there every play with my peers
4302635 i hurt my ankle in the seattle game in 2006 and after the season we didnt think it was that bad and that it would heal up naturally
4302636 i came back at the end of march and started working out but i was having some pain and our strength coach duane carlisle noticed that i was limping when we were out running he mentioned it to the trainers and i had an mri and we found out that i had bone chips and that i needed surgery
4302637 my main goal was not forcing things to where i re injured it before camp which was hard because i just knew that i didnt have enough time to get it to where i really needed to be i didnt get to train the way i would have liked and i just felt like i was rushing things and that everything was bad
4302638 my first love was baseball but i got to high school and saw that all of the excitement was at the football games no one came to the baseball games and that crowd starts to call you the football games had 10 000 plus fans every friday night and when you are in high school you want to be in that spotlight
4302639 the game is just executing what you practice i really enjoy practice because its fun you are laughing and joking with your teammates while you are getting better i can always feel myself getting better from practicing and so its something i enjoy not being able to go full go like i wanted really upset me i think it hurt my game a lot too
4302640 i think it was from compensating for the ankle and also probably just the wear and tear
4302641 it was icing on the cake for a bad year that i just try not to even think about it thats a chapter in my book of life that im skipping it was just one of those years that you have to deal with and then you move on
4302642 i decided i was going to start much earlier on my training and for the remainder of my career thats something im going to keep doing
4302643 ill take one week and thats it i dont train as hard as i would normally but im going to stay active with the running in january and february instead of waiting until march
4302644 im just doing everything and anything i can to improve my game whatever that is
4302645 i stayed longer at the facility every day when i got done working out id always stay and go work on my footwork and my ball drills and put an extra hour in out there
4302646 im playing for my name and to improve my overall game
4302647 every day i will go to work and work on improving my overall game it doesnt matter about anything else period im just worrying about playing my best football and im doing everything i can to improve hopefully i can help myself this season and my team
4302648 in football ill take the cards that are dealt this season and play them the best i can and hopefully i come out on top
4302649 but my house is never boring and regardless of what is going on im so happy when im at home with the kids its great its fun they all have completely different personalities and my wife and i just love watching them and seeing what theyll do next

4302757 we estimate e save technology has the potential to save 1
4302758 our strategy for the single phase motor efficiency controller which is targeted at the millions of home and light commercial appliances made each year is to go directly to oems to include the technology in new appliances we have completed several redesigns of this product incorporating numerous innovations to improve the energy savings and reduce the costs as a result we believe this technology may be the most effective and economical way to improve the efficiency of the tens of millions of new washers dryers and refrigerators made by oems each year we are presently establishing evaluations with several oems and forming new relationships to promote the technology to additional oems
4302759 our main goals for the remainder of 2008 are releasing a full line of certified motor efficiency controllers proving out numerous industrial applications commencing testing of the single phase mec with e save technology by several appliance manufacturers and gaining commitments from oems for the three phase mecs with e save technology
4302760 bentley green is one of the most compelling individuals i have ever met even at the age of 7 i recently had the honor of spending a few days getting to know him and it was obvious to me is that his talent is only transcended by his intelligence and infectious personality he has an ability to own the stage like no child entertainer ive seen since michael jackson

4302857 we believe there should be one pilot body for ba and its subsidiary so that there can be fair promotion opportunities a cohesion of the pilot force which is so important in a safety critical industry and a safeguarding of bas brand
4302858 openskies is being set up with ba money will fly ba planes and draw on the ba brand and a brand is more than a tailfin it is about its people and the ba pilot community is making a stand to protect that brand this is a line in the sand

4302872 it does bother me that much of that is directed at us our job is to provide energy to provide it in a means that is reliable and we hope we can provide it in a means thats convenient as well to the consumer

4302874 the draft is a totalitarian institution based on the idea that the government owns you and can dispose of your life as it wishes

4302940 were more frustrated about this than anybody else swasey said
4302941 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4302942 ultimately al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4302943 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4302944 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4302945 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4302946 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4302947 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4302948 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4302949 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4302950 ultimately al qaeda couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4302951 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4302952 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4302953 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4302954 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4302955 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4302956 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4302957 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4302958 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4302959 among those displaced are people who have had to abandon their homes several times in the recent months
4302960 many people have received basic humanitarian relief but as the number of displaced persons increases so do their needs
4302961 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains tense and unpredictable with ongoing military operations and exchange of mortar artillery shelling and air attacks
4302962 a lot of people are sleeping in makeshift shelters we expect the numbers to climb up from about 112 000 to 200 000 displaced people if fighting gets worse in the weeks ahead
4302963 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4302966 id be happy for those guys to get some snaps
4302967 hes close its more of an irritation now than an injury i would say so were just going to play that one a little easy
4302968 but its nothing i would think that he could play in a game if he had to
4302969 i had a tight back earlier in the week i probably shouldnt have said anything the hardest part is just standing around ironically
4302970 it felt tight when we landed in minnesota and got worse not better
4302971 our thing weve been experimenting and looking is to feel enough confidence in charlies ability to do the job that i can use seneca in other things

4302977 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4302978 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4302979 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4302980 dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out the state will be a lot better off without these illegal alien lovers
4302981 this election is going to cost us more than 100 000 to only have one person not succeed
4302982 cr mudaliar has a very active mind and made a significant contribution for his one term on council
4302983 cr barnes has been on council for quite a long time and he has really been public minded as has cr lloyd in his many years on council
4302984 in their own way they have all been very good councillors and they will be missed
4302985 the last two elections i have been larry on the ballot paper so i am disappointed it has been changed because it is now running through the nsw electoral commission
4302986 with a competition the size of the blake getting short listed is success enough it certainly isnt about winning and to be named is such an honour in itself
4302987 at the moment we have strong containment lines and we are expecting it to be completely out by last night
4302988 we have established the fire was an accidental ignition from a dropped cigarette
4302989 i think a lot of people underestimate just how dry it is at this time of year and how quickly a fire can start
4302990 it was lucky that no homes were destroyed and we were able to put precautionary measures in place in case the wind changed
4302991 we are urging the community to make sure they be aware that fires can start easily because next time more damage could be caused
4302992 this was a prime example of the cooperation between the rural fire service the nsw fire brigade and national parks putting in a joint effort
4302993 there is still a fair amount of work that needs to be done before september 1 but we have put plans in place to how that is all going to happen
4302994 the pollies for small business concept is a good one and i thoroughly enjoy participating each year
4302995 while brief the experience is a great reminder of the vital role small business plays particularly in regional areas
4302996 i have owned and operated a small business and know how vital they are
4302997 that is why i am such a staunch campaigner for small business and those people they employ
4302998 they are the wealth creators for our nation and i enjoyed spending time with the staff at arlington gasweld and steiger electronics
4302999 im sure owners lynda hennessy and paul harrison will have me hard at work and ill try to use some of my powers of persuasion to sell lots of jewellery and giftware

4303002 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4303003 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4303004 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4303005 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4303006 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4303022 streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown
4303023 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
4303024 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
4303025 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
4303026 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice
4303027 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job

4303068 we know what messages will work and what will not

4303160 los resultados son satisfactorios en las reas del mural donde se aplic este tratamiento porque los pigmentos quedaron fijos en el muro y no hay riesgo de que se desprendan a diferencia de otras a n no tratadas
4303161 estas part culas extremadamente peque as son de hidr xido de calcio y son estructuras de forma hexagonal que penetran con facilidad en la superficie pict rica
4303162 por reacci n qu mica comienzan a interactuar entre ellas hasta formar algo as como una red microsc pica en la que
4303163 los pigmentos que corren riesgo de desprenderse la cual con el paso del tiempo se cristaliza y estabiliza la pintura mural
4303164 esta tecnolog a no se ve afectada por las condiciones del medio ambiente como es el caso de los pol meros o adhesivos sint ticos que solieron usarse en los a os 70 y 80
4303165 de acuerdo con los estudios realizados en m xico se aplicaron pol meros de acr lico de vinil y de vinil acetato los cuales con las modificaciones clim ticas provocan la degradaci n de la pintura mural misma que se acelera con la humedad
4303166 estos sistemas son eficientes para extraer pol meros nos ayudan a removerlos y luego mediante el uso de nanopart culas los pigmentos se adhieren al carbonato de calcio y este a su vez queda fijo en la pared
4303167 al paso del tiempo la efectividad de la aplicaci n de esta tecnolog a en este lugar ha sido satisfactoria ahora lo hemos contactado para el uso de esta metodolog a en los proyectos de conservaci n experimental de la pintura mural de cholula palenque mayap n y tlatelolco que han sido elegidos por la complejidad que presentan los murales
4303168 en el caso de cholula la pintura fue creada pr cticamente sobre la tierra ha perdido su aglutinante natural y por tanto ha perdido su consistencia en estos momentos nos estamos centrando en el mural los bebedores donde se presentan tres factores da inos la humedad sales y pol meros sint ticos
4303169 las sales al tratar de salir a la superficie van rompiendo los materiales de la pintura y en consecuencia el desprendimiento de sta
4303170 la intervenci n del mural de cholula es un trabajo a mediano plazo toda vez que el tratamiento con nanopart culas despu s de haber sido aplicado requiere de dos o tres meses para tener la reacci n completa de la carbonataci n y se culmine el proceso
4303171 well i cant remember a president who wasnt named clinton or bush and i think its time to try something else
4303172 fair point but the clinton years those were were good years
4303173 my worry with obama is that a lot of whites wont support him but hes a good candidate
4303174 la hora y el d a que nos convoque ah estaremos apoyando

4303176 m xico no puede aguantar m s estamos en el punto m s alto de la inseguridad
4303177 si empeora no s qu va a pasar con el pa s
4303178 yo creo que la gran mayor a piensa que van a incrementar la tasa 25 puntos base pero nosotros creemos que es necesario una acci n mucho m s fuerte que eso y por eso estamos anticipando una acci n mucho m s fuerte de eso y por lo mismo estamos anticipando un aumento de hasta 50 puntos base
4303179 al anunciar que anticipa m s inflaci n debe responder en el mismo sentido diciendo que no lo va a tolerar y no tomar medidas mediocres como un aumento de 25 puntos base o algo por el estilo

4303181 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
4303182 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
4303183 it was used in concentration camps in world war ii and by saddam hussein against the kurds in the 1990s
4303184 and put it in a little capsule it is in fact used as a suicide pill just like you see in the movies
4303185 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4303186 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4303187 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4303188 impressive studies indicating that mifepristone is very effective in the treatment of psychotic depression
4303189 my sister needs to come visit me so i can get caught up on my scrapbooking
4303190 this is a book which we have sent down to you full of blessings so that they may ponder over its verses and that men of understanding may remember
4303191 the science by which the quran is understood its meanings explained and its rulings derived
4303192 the example of a people who recite the quran and do not know its explanation is like a group of people who have a written message from their king that comes to them during the night and they do not have a lamp therefore they do not know what is in the message the example of one who knows tafseer is like a person who comes to them with a lamp and reads to them what is in the message
4303193 whoever recites the quran and does not explain it is like an ignorant person
4303194 the quran is like a treasure trapped in a glass receptacle mankind can view and benefit from this treasure but they are in need of tafseer for tafseer acts like the key that unlocks the treasure so that mankind can benefit from it to the greatest possible extent

4303201 i saw them as a team on the rise i wanted to be a part of that my whole thought process coming in here was to give these guys another hand
4303202 i just have to be patient like i have been all along i know i will get my opportunity at some point patience will take you a long ways
4303203 his first role is to come in and contribute on special teams
4303204 but the reason i like him on top of that is if something was to happen to peterson and or taylor you can trust that he will go in and play he can truly come in and help you and not lose a beat
4303205 hell be a little bit of a change up for us
4303206 en los conflictos armados de este tipo el n mero de heridos es tres veces m s alto que el de muertos y por ahora no hemos o do hablar de 6 000 heridos o m s
4303207 es dif cil dar una cifra exacta muchas personas han sido enterradas en los jardines
4303208 constantemente encontramos nuevos cad veres hasta ahora hemos identificado 200 y todav a hay 500 desaparecidos

4303210 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4303211 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4303212 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4303213 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4303214 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4303215 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4303216 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4303217 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4303218 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4303219 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4303220 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4303221 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4303222 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4303223 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4303224 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4303225 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4303226 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4303227 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4303228 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4303229 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4303230 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4303231 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4303232 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4303233 yo ten a la idea sobre dos chicas que se van lejos un verano alguien me llam de barcelona y me dijo quieres hacer la pel cula aqu la financiamos

4303243 but he who did not know yet committed things deserving of stripes shall be beaten with few for everyone to whom much is required and to whom much has been committed of him they will ask the more

4303245 help me i need you to help me i cant do this
4303246 all the treasures of wisdom and the ninevites and the queen of sheba will judge the jews of jesus day because they showed less interest and willingness to heed even though they had a much greater opportunity again this makes me wonder ii how about our generation today a will the men of nineveh condemn us 1 they were quick to repent after hearing the one message of jonah a how many sermons have we heard yet failed to repent b they were given but forty days how many years has god given us to repent 2 they repented when all they had was a simple message a we have gods full and final revelation written and preserved for us b we have gods word revealed through his son and his apostles c we have likely had the blessing of parents teachers preachers and many other christians encouraging us to live for god if we do not heed the message of jesus christ dont you think the ninevites will consider us foolish on the day of judgment b will the queen of the south condemn us 1 she was willing to travel a great distance to hear solomon a have we been unwilling to travel a short distance to hear the words of christ proclaimed b she traveled on camels through desert for months at great risk yet some wont travel in air conditioned cars for an hour or less when there is only minimal risk 2 she highly valued solomons wisdom giving great gifts to him a do we value the wisdom of the son of god b are we willing to offer the gifts of our time and energy to learn the wisdom of christ as revealed in his word if we are unwilling to learn the will of christ for us today will not the queen of sheba consider us foolish on the day of judgment c will even more recent generations condemn us 1 think of those in the nineteenth century a who often traveled by wagon or horseback for hours to hear gods word b who sat on logs in brush arbors or under tents 2 think of those in the first half of the twentieth century a who sat in hot un airconditioned buildings b who went to protracted meetings every night often for three or more weeks 3 think of those who struggled to come out of denominationalism a studying gods word carefully to learn the simplicity of new testament christianity b often making the difficult decision to leave family and friends to follow the way of christ if we balk at attending services regularly taking advantages of gospel meetings and bible studies offered in nice comfortable buildings will not those who preceded us think us foolish on the day of judgment conclusion 1 as jesus said to his disciples on another occasion for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
4303247 you have such beautiful eyes if only youd lose some weight we might be able to see them

4303287 he was born in china he died in china he helped the chinese people and he had a great love for china it really was his frame of reference in his life
4303288 these things endear him to the chinese even though in principle there is a hesitancy about making a hero of someone who was a christian missionary
4303289 it would be very difficult for an eric liddell type to do more than potter around these days because of the devotion required to compete
4303290 they suffered a great deal of deprivation at weifeng he must have deteriorated a great deal there but what was the cause of the brain tumor that eventually caused his death is another matter
4303291 the position of sport has changed so much it has become almost a new religion a form of idolatry
4303292 compliance has certainly had the biggest single impact on enterprise attitudes to storage
4303293 a few years ago there was very little interest in storage security but now demand has soared
4303294 storage is a hot topic in security right now it used to be managed in isolation from the rest of it so it was thought of as a big black box that wasnt connected with the rest of the it environment now however storage is generally ip ready so this attitude has started to change plus having to prove that you are compliant is a big shift
4303295 in the us internal threats are often the most severe in terms of the fallout physical security is key to data security and must not be overlooked
4303296 the disgruntled employee whose access card still works is one of the biggest potential problems
4303297 to begin with you have to classify your information into high and low risk depending on your business
4303298 the question is who actually owns that data its not as simple as encrypting email a lot of companies have significant issues in this area and its not a problem i see being solved soon
4303299 these problems have been solved long ago and there is increasing interest in secure storage products
4303300 previously there was a lot of confusion about storage encryption some companies used to market storage security tools that were essentially appliances that encrypted the stream of data en route to the storage device this is not the same as the data encryption we know today the older approach only addressed a small part of the problem
4303301 its worth remembering that even encrypting the entire database doesnt necessarily keep out the hackers
4303302 application attacks will still work if the application has legitimate access to the data the information can be siphoned off through it storage has to be considered alongside the deployment of technologies such as strong authentication network access control and application security
4303303 the technology is being implemented but only by around 20 per cent of businesses due to these two factors more are beginning to adopt encryption technologies but this will take some time
4303304 deduplication technology has accelerated in the past 12 to 18 months it works by breaking data down into chunks then removing all those that look similar this can produce reduction ratios of up to 20 1 so it is obviously very popular however encryption rarely works well in tandem with deduplication so its essential to check that your have compatibility
4303305 it offers an incredible boost in performance but presents some new issues such as how to erase the data completely after use another recent trend has been the increasing inclusion of security features as part of network storage devices before it was possible to add on functionality such as encryption but now its often a feature of cisco switches for example
4303306 the future of storage will see a similar progression to that shown by encryption well see a growing number of services currently seen as add ons included as features in products
4303307 for example i think we will soon see data classification become native so that credit card numbers are recognised as such for example this will then be linked to data loss policies to stop this kind of high risk personal data being emailed or copied
4303308 policies will become increasingly centralised to keep up with demand and compliance reports will be automated just as security policies are beginning to be
4303309 enterprises need to get the basics right before buying storage solutions
4303310 its all about having a solid base risk management strategies must be in place and event logging and monitoring must be running smoothly its all about a holistic approach also remember after buying your storage solution that youll need to harden it turn off services you dont need and disable unwanted functions and have robust access control measures in place
4303311 data storage is still uncharted territory for many it security professionals
4303312 however as the perimeter dissolves it will inevitably have to be given more consideration the secure area retreated to the server then the application server and now finally the database is the last bastion of defence it professionals are waking up to its importance

4303334 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
4303335 australian workers urgently need the rest of work choices to be scrapped and to have their rights to collectively bargain restored
4303336 we want to see peoples rights in the workplace respected and that includes of course if they have chosen to join a union having the union able to represent them
4303337 it is the same model we put on the table with unions during negotiations which aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
4303338 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia

4303366 its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4303367 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4303370 we want to encourage cambodians to use khmer unicode software later on we will come up with a software to make it accessible on mobile phones
4303371 we will bring in a yearly update in order to reduce the number of errors to the maximum one day cambodians will be able to download this dictionary on the website www budinst gov kh

4303412 in telstras case it is comforting to see the company converting the strong data volumes into robust sales growth
4303413 the transformation spend may be indicative of some overspend delay in the transformation program while the increase in the business as usual capex is indicative of the aggressive capex sales expectations management had set

4303443 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites
4303444 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
4303445 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon
4303446 as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies
4303447 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on

4303459 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the indian economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 per cent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
4303460 according to our assessment despite a slowdown in the last six months the interest of the nris has increased almost by 20 25 every quarter that is almost two to two and a half times in the last two to three years
4303461 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
4303462 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property in india while investors from uk and usa are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from
4303463 the property price upswing seen in the indian market has made nris very bullish about the indian real estate nri segment contributes to about 25 30 investment both for the end use and for investment
4303464 many nris have shown keen interest in luxury homes in places like khar bandra and powai due to their vicinity to the airport also there has been interest in projects in kandivali and borivali for many maharashtrians abroad pune is the preferred location for investment many a times a crisis situation in their country brings them to other countries for investment

4303469 let me guess youre here in washington on behalf of president musharraf
4303470 and youve been all over washington for the last few days talking to people at the pentagon the cia the state department the white house
4303471 yes they put me out into the street afterward so politely
4303472 and you can tell they arent going to do jack squat right
4303473 this jack squat is he also on the faculty at catholic university
4303474 but i assure you hes on the staff of every department in the federal government see here sir
4303475 but i am quite sure i have never seen him paint anything
4303476 president musharraf has played both ends against the middle so long now he finds himself between a rock and a hard place
4303477 in pakistan we would say he is pulling on the tail of an elephant that has eaten too many rotten mangoes
4303478 it is evident that you understand my predicament and that of my countrys fearless leader quite well
4303479 three out of four pakistani provinces have demanded his impeachment
4303480 so he sent you here to ask uncle sam to bail him out
4303481 that is it the bail out uncle sam he bails out your banks your freddies and your fannies and your bears he bails out your chryslers and your farmers and everyone and anyone so why will uncle sam not bail out his good friend president musharraf i am thinking very deeply upon this last night and cannot make an answer of any sort no not one not a single one not of the least plausible phrases i swear to you so the idea comes to me in the deep dark of a sleepless night that i should ask tom collins the one whom i have heard is the smartest person inside the beltway
4303482 but you must realize my friend that being the smartest person inside the beltway is like being the tallest building in baltimore
4303483 but i fear my regrets will be rather more severe indeed tell me mr collins if you can
4303484 why it is that after so many years of helping the united states every branch of your government now turns its back on my beloved leader
4303485 yes why indeed could it have been his constant goading of the indians the way he incessantly rattled the saber always pushing toward then backing off from the brink of a regional nuclear war
4303486 couldnt everybody tell he was just having a bit of fun jerking on the hindu dogs chain so to speak surely you here in washington could tell he was just joking he only did that to win popular support at home
4303487 but we americans take nuclear war pretty seriously after all we invented it then theres that business with the isi
4303488 that business about the isi being on both sides of the war on terrorism you must have heard of that
4303489 you of all people must realize that the isi has been a power unto itself since before either of us were even born why blame what they do on poor president musharraf this complaining about the isi i will tell you without uncertainty i have heard it from everybody i have visited here with the exception of the federal reserve they just remarked about pakistans credit rating instead can we help it if our country doesnt have any oil look at israel they dont have any oil either but uncle sam hes sending them billions
4303490 so the jews are the apples and we moslems are the oranges
4303491 and you americans you prefer johnny appleseed to orange julius then
4303492 i dont know about that but we definitely prefer our metaphors straight up not mixed in any case my friend you must admit the way your boss handled the benazir bhutto affair cant go unnoticed
4303493 you cannot believe that president musharraf had anything at all to do with her assassination to think that why it is as if someone were to suggest that there was some kind of conspiracy to kill your president kennedy when all sane rational people know that man harvey oswald he surely must have acted alone
4303494 do bee do bee do this is your sinatra is it not
4303495 since you brought up the subject my friend id say that its pretty obvious that pervez musharraf definitely did it his way but just as obviously he doesnt understand how america treats its ah how shall i put it native friends yes thats it he doesnt understand how america treats its native friends
4303496 yeah you know like ngo dinh diem the president of south vietnam
4303497 that my knowledge of southeast asian history is somewhat incomplete what exactly are you saying mr collins
4303498 im saying my pakistani native friend that despite all the things he did for america when push came to shove uncle sams good buddy native friend ngo dinh diem ended up twisting slowly in the wind
4303499 english is difficult enough but when i have to speak it with americans i am sometimes completely at a loss as you say
4303500 but come to think of it a lot of instances of flatulence who play ball with us do end up like diem did then theres manuel noriega he used to be real good buddies with the united states particularly the central intelligence agency and look what happened to him
4303501 yes yes i know it a country in central america on one side is ah colombia yes and on the other is costa rica and you americans you built a big canal there right
4303502 and we put manuel noriega in charge of it and then we went in and arrested his sorry butt and put him in an american prison
4303503 because ronald reagan felt like it thats why then there were the somozas
4303504 when you know quite well that i am a pakistani
4303505 im talking about the somoza family and the dynasty of somozas who ruled the country of nicaragua in the name of the monroe doctrine and the united fruit company
4303506 how a family of spanish people in the country on the other side of costa rica from panama became named after indian fritters
4303507 exactly a complete coincidence so the last of the somoza clan he was named anastasio somoza and he was very very good friends with citigroup sears roebuck westinghouse and coca cola
4303508 but when a series of natural disasters and financial swindles ruined the economy the starving barefoot peasants rose up against him in a marxist revolt and when they rode into managua the capital city shooting their in the air riding around the presidential palace waving bottles of rum the somozas had to pack their bags and run away and do you know what washington did
4303509 tell me do you think president musharraf will be allowed to leave pakistan or do you think he will be forced to stay there and face criminal charges
4303510 says the united states has issued an announcement that musharraf is expected to resign within the next few days
4303511 thats exactly what the democrats said they were going to get nixon for its dollars to donuts that the pakistani parliament got that entire list from right down the street at foggy bottom you know what it means dont you
4303512 it means all he has to do is resign and they will let him go
4303513 you have surely turned my day of utter despair into one of undiluted joy

4303713 we thought it would also be useful for you to know some more about the price increases we have made at the july sight the overall effect of which is plus 5 percent
4303714 where delegates expressed a keen desire to receive a more detailed breakdown of future price changes
4303715 oh i know its a great release its a great release you be fearing walking the streets and stuff like that that
4303716 we were frightened we were frightened we have a lot of young kids and girls around here that we all look out for we were very concerned
4303717 in order to preserve the capital value of the unitholders investments in the fund and until such time that the above assessment and audit have been completed the board has determined that the fund will not pay distributions from the months of july and august
4303718 we understand that many of our unitholders staff and directors are relying on these distribution payments in what has been a challenging year
4303719 but the board must ensure that the value of the funds assets and unitholders investments are preserved and this can only be done by ensuring the projects financed by the fund are completed in an orderly manner
4303720 the board have considered the interests of all stakeholders and believe that the terms of the proposal are designed to protect the interests of all parties so that unitholders will get full value for their investment yet there will be no dilution of value to ordinary shareholders
4303721 loans scheduled to be repaid during september and october should generate sufficient funds to fully repay the funds finance facility leaving it debt free at the time the offer opens to unitholders
4303722 and we desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the world and to make them the imams and to make them the heirs

4303760 what am i forgetting i feel like im forgetting something
4303761 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4303762 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4303763 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4303764 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4303765 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4303766 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4303767 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4303768 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4303769 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4303770 would have to be priced based on the date of the actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge
4303771 advised mr jobs that the board would have to confirm its prior approval in a legally satisfactory method
4303772 fred relied on these statements by mr jobs and from them concluded the grant was being properly handled
4303773 with interest rate and petrol prices up and share prices and superannuation falling i think its going to be some time before things change
4303774 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly the fourth quarter
4303775 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility
4303776 we utilised the strong economic climate in late 2006 and 2007 to implement cost efficiency programs that have delivered and will continue to deliver sustainable and significant cost savings both fixed and variable in 2007 08 and beyond
4303777 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4303778 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4303779 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4303780 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4303781 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4303782 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent

4303803 their stated aim is to record some observations on the challenges and opportunities in project management research in order to stimulate discussion about the role of research in academics and industry
4303804 the managerial activities needed to lead a project to a successful end
4303805 although each direction is a world of its own the real challenge is to combine them all into a unified view
4303806 success in project management can only be achieved by an integrated holistic view of the entire landscape of the project

4303811 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4303812 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4303813 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4303814 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4303815 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4303816 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4303817 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it

4303824 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4303825 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4303826 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4303827 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4303828 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4303829 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4303830 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4303831 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4303832 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4303833 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4303834 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4303835 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4303836 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4303837 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4303838 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4303839 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4303840 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4303841 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4303842 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4303843 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4303844 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4303845 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4303846 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4303847 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4303848 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4303849 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4303850 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4303851 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4303852 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4303853 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4303854 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4303855 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4303856 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4303857 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4303858 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4303859 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4303860 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4303861 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4303862 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4303863 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4303864 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4303865 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4303866 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4303867 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4303868 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4303869 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4303870 m xico tiene la obligaci n de evitar que los eeuu caigan con toda su fuerza contra nuestros pa ses del continente
4303871 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4303872 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4303873 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan

4303886 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4303887 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4303888 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4303889 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4303890 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4303891 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4303892 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4303893 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4303894 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws

4303896 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4303897 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4303898 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4303899 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4303900 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4303901 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4303902 interoperability among devices from multiple manufacturers is important for consumer adoption of superspeed usb products
4303903 usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4303904 its a shame that it took the reality of an alternative spec to make this come true intel should have opened it up without this one has to question a monopolist leading a spec like this in the future
4303905 metal recycling in the uk is a business worth 5 billion that contributes a significant amount to the uk economy and plays a critical role in the countrys ability to hit its eu recycling targets said wright

4303907 intermet has worked hard and made impressive gains in efficiency profitability and quality

4303913 it took the red army excuse me the russian army only two days to secure abkhazia and south ossetia
4303914 by crossing georgias borders the russians have committed their worst violation of international law since the invasion of afghanistan in 1979
4303915 at a time like this it is vital for the leaders of the west to stand together and make clear that this aggression will not stand
4303916 likewise the russian attacks on georgia if left unchecked could easily trigger more conflict in the future the kremlin has embarked on a campaign to destabilize not just pro western georgia but other former soviet satrapies that refuse to toe its line many of these states have their own russian minorities whose alleged maltreatment provides the perfect excuse for russian meddling today georgia tomorrow ukraine the day after estonia
4303917 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
4303918 incidentally has russia really been helping much on iran it has gone along with while delaying three united nations security council resolutions that have imposed mild sanctions on iran but it has also supplied material for irans nuclear program and is now selling iran antiaircraft systems to protect military and nuclear installations
4303919 objective is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet
4303920 subduing georgia has an additional effect it warns russias former baltic and east european satellites what happens if you get too close to the west it is the first step to re establishing russian hegemony in the region

4303935 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4303936 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4303937 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4303938 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4303939 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4303940 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4303941 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4303942 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4303943 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4303944 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4303945 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4303946 so cool he definitely is a father slash older brother figure but at the same time i can still go out with him and have an amazing time

4303971 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4303972 overall the battlefield care is much better than even in desert storm one its really not what the doctors are doing its soldiers taking care of themselves soldiers taking care of each other the best trained medics weve ever had the most courageous medics weve ever had
4303973 we train them to do very quickly what emts and even paramedics do in the civilian sector they learn fast theyre 18 year old kids and they know theyre going to be using those skills and theyre paying attention because they know that they themselves could be one of the patients dont underestimate what an 18 year old kid who decided to defer college to serve his or her country can learn they can learn a hell of a lot
4303974 getting definitive care on the battlefield at the point of injury i think attests to most of the lifesaving on the battlefield if you stop a bleed soon keep a wound clean at the point of injury its saving hundreds of lives
4303975 a lot of solutions to medical problems arent medical theyre engineering solutions theyre it solutions theyre culturation persuading people not to plant that bomb stuff like that the burn thing is one of them

4303988 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
4303989 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4303990 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4303991 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4303992 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done

4304010 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4304011 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure

4304013 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time

4304016 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4304017 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4304018 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4304019 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4304020 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4304021 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4304022 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times

4304080 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4304081 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4304082 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

4304086 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4304087 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4304088 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition

4304100 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4304101 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4304102 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4304103 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4304104 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4304105 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4304106 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4304107 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4304108 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4304109 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4304110 we have to get the country off the 700 billion a year it spends on foreign oil

4304115 as soon as you open up the marketplace you are going to see an explosion in entrepreneurial activity
4304116 theres an emerging consensus that renewables which have been derided for so long as a pop gun when you need a cannon are showing signs of being able to contribute on a much larger scale than anyone has thought
4304117 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4304118 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4304119 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4304120 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4304121 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4304122 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4304123 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4304124 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4304125 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4304126 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4304127 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4304128 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4304129 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4304130 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4304131 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4304132 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4304133 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4304134 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4304135 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4304136 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4304137 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4304138 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4304139 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4304140 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4304141 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4304142 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4304143 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4304144 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4304145 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4304146 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4304147 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4304148 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4304149 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4304150 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4304151 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4304152 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4304153 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4304154 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4304155 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4304156 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4304157 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4304158 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

4304193 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
4304194 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that
4304195 matthew 18 6 this scripture is referring to all of gods children god will avenge his children youd better think twice before you hurt gods own n otice that two thirds of the gospel is bad news good news
4304196 to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose the bible does not say all things are good it is a sad thing when a loved one dies but we know that god is still on his throne and in control why
4304197 you cant have light without dark or joy without misery or work without sleep good news
4304198 and the bible says he was also one of jesus disciples no mention is ever made of this man until the time of christs burial
4304199 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4304200 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4304201 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4304202 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4304203 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4304204 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4304205 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4304206 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4304207 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4304208 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4304209 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4304210 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
4304211 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
4304212 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4304213 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
4304214 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
4304215 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4304216 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4304217 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4304218 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4304219 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4304220 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4304221 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4304222 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
4304223 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4304224 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4304225 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4304226 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4304227 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4304228 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4304229 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4304230 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4304231 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4304232 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4304233 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4304234 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4304235 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4304236 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4304237 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4304238 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4304239 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4304240 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4304241 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4304242 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4304243 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4304244 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4304245 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4304246 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4304247 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4304248 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4304249 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4304250 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4304251 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4304252 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4304253 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

4304273 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4304274 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4304275 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4304276 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4304277 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4304278 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4304279 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4304280 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4304281 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4304282 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4304283 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4304284 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4304285 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4304286 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4304287 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4304288 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4304289 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born
4304290 dual citizenship not recognized except for persons under 21 years old
4304291 a person who but for the proviso to section 87 1 would be a citizen of kenya by virtue of that subsection shall be entitled upon making application before the specified date in such manner as may be prescribed by or under an act of parliament to be registered as a citizen of kenya provided that a person who has not attained the age of twenty one years other than a woman who is or has been married may not himself make an application under this subsection but an application may be made on his behalf by his parent or guardian

4304301 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4304302 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4304303 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town
4304304 no one can give us a sense of authority we must earn it and we must take it

4304312 its simple the word planet has lost all scientific value
4304313 if you have to ask twenty questions after i say ive discovered a planet the word has lost its utility
4304314 if were going rely on one word and put them all in one pot what are we doing as scientists and educators the time has come to discard the useless words and invent a whole new system to respect the level of science we have achieved were in desperate need of a new lexicon to accommodate this knowledge
4304315 how we categorize things is part of the science process it is natural for humans to group things together with common characteristics as a tool to better understand and how they work this applies to biology and astronomy as well
4304316 you wanted a definition they gave you a definition and now youre complaining about it
4304317 if you only want to call round things planets that puts pluto in the same class as jupiter i happen to like round things but what other lexicon might be available to group similar things together
4304318 its good to have a good general starting point for classifying things
4304319 i am certain that the world plutocracy is traceable to what disney has done so its hard to extricate the sentiment we have for the planet from the dog
4304320 the planet count went down and what was the justification of that the proponents have never given a good explanation of what was motivating that perspective
4304321 is to get the notion of counting things out of your system and comb the solar system for the richness of objects ask about different ways to combine the different objects in our solar system and have a discussion about their different properties
4304322 we both have issues with what happened with the iau its part of an ongoing presentation but the important things is that the public gets to see the debate and its not a battle over what list and what numbers you have but the debate of the issues thats more important whether either of us have convinced you of one perspective science in this country is too much memorizing lists promulgated by those in authority this is helping to expose the messy side of science this debate is good and positive
4304323 how many sciences get to have their issues debated in the op ed pages and comics
4304324 there should be a way to celebrate a new way to think about things there ought to be a way to capture that

4304355 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely

4304406 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right

4304418 lets round them up in a special edition of vogue
4304419 the outright taboo subject of racism in the fashion industry
4304420 i am virtually never allowed to photograph black models for the magazines fashion houses cosmetic brands perfume companies and advertising clients i work for whenever i ask to use a black model i am given excuses such as black models are not aspirational in some markets or they do not reflect the brands values normally however no reason is given
4304421 if i judge by my own feelings i can only guess the indignation anger rage and fury that black models must feel
4304422 if you look at the catwalks the shows in london paris milan its the same right across the board theres a total under representation of black models in the fashion industry it happens in editorial and on the runways
4304423 i dont think it comes from the photographers i dont think it comes from the fashion editors i dont like to parcel out blame but you have to look at why business allows it i guess these companies are being told what sells and what doesnt sell and i think within those marketing strategies are assumed racisms
4304424 as if human beings actually act like that people dont behave as asians they dont behave as americans they dont behave as black people they dont behave as bmw drivers they dont behave as any of the stereotypes we put across
4304425 i realized i was accepting racism and bigotry and i needed to make a statement
4304426 what these companies fail to realize is a we spend billions over all sectors of industry and b as a smaller segment we still influence the masses
4304427 most of the trends we see it can all be traced to urban culture its simply been adopted and made palatable for mass consumption
4304428 marc jacobs jeweler wears his pants low black men started doing that in jail because they didnt have belts
4304429 women spend money to get lip enhancements butt implants more tan skin theyre seeking to mimic people with ethnic features traits that are found in african american women
4304430 i remember when black models were everywhere in the 70s
4304431 issey miyake yves saint laurent they used so many black girls weve gone from that to the situation now where there are these token attempts to integrate black women its distasteful to me fashion should be intriguing and alluring whats alluring about a parade of white girls
4304432 was co opted and the reality was left to fill the void
4304433 were living in a very conformist time where the national ideal is a girl with blond hair a fake tan fake boobs and fake lips its a very plastic ideal that dominates our culture
4304434 the hot bimbo archetype is whats screwing everything up for everybody not just women of color
4304435 i dont think this is hard core racism i think its more inertia and stupidity on the part of the fashion industry its lack of imagination
4304436 theres a collective responsibility the fashion industry has to get their a into gear come into the 21st century open the windows and doors and see all the beautiful girls that are out there and not have preconceived ideas about it this is reprehensible and it needs to change

4304456 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4304457 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4304458 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4304459 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4304460 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4304461 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4304462 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4304463 who are open to doing something on the production side
4304464 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4304465 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4304466 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4304467 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4304468 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4304469 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4304470 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4304471 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4304472 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4304473 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4304474 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4304475 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4304476 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4304477 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4304478 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4304479 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4304480 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4304481 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4304482 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4304483 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4304484 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4304485 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4304486 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4304487 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4304488 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4304489 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4304490 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4304491 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4304492 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4304493 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4304494 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4304495 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4304496 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4304497 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4304498 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4304499 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4304500 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4304501 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4304502 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4304503 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4304504 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4304505 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4304506 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4304507 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4304508 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4304509 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4304510 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4304511 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4304512 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4304513 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4304514 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4304515 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4304516 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4304517 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4304518 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4304519 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4304520 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4304521 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4304522 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4304523 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4304524 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4304525 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4304526 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4304527 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4304528 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4304529 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4304530 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4304531 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology

4304533 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4304534 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4304535 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4304536 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4304537 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4304538 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4304539 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4304540 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4304582 shellburner the video is available at their website all proceeds go to youth hunting activities
4304583 minnesota only is the modifier that raises the kellers videography effort above others these guys are serious about exclaiming that plenty of great waterfowling still exists in minnesota if one goes looking
4304584 shellburner is too harvest oriented that the dvds long running footage of birds being decoyed and called to their fates needs buffeting by equally riveting discussions about conservation

4304586 none of us had ever been there and we wanted to give it a try
4304587 all is lost for the states waterfowlers is that theyve had things too easy in the past
4304588 hunters have minnesota the dakotas nebraska and montana nurtured in recent years when birds have been so flush that in some instances limits have been taken in an hour or less

4304607 we will be keeping the heat on anybody involved in drug trafficking especially heroin trafficking in huntington
4304608 in recent months weve bought heroin for the first time since unites been in operation
4304609 basically all three of the task forces have bought small amounts of heroin
4304610 i think its just a matter of time until heroin is a drug of choice in the region
4304611 that was a problem that really was instantly at epidemic proportions
4304612 the heroin that we sent to the lab here is coming back in the 60s to 75 percent range so its extremely potent and thats what led to the overdose deaths
4304613 after throwing four to five hundred of them its a nice little workout

4304624 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4304625 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4304626 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4304627 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4304635 my fundamental opposition to obamas presidential candidacy involves public policy differences
4304636 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4304637 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4304638 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the u s senate
4304639 obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was a muslim
4304640 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be
4304641 i told him to bring in it and let it go
4304642 then i got a call from another person that the seal was found in the back seat of a car
4304643 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4304644 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4304645 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4304646 i would like the general public to understand that this is not something to be trivialized or minimized
4304647 this is actually a case of discrimination i would like to see other women come out and file their complaints as well

4304656 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4304657 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4304658 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4304659 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh

4304668 no action on climate change no hope and no vision
4304669 i just dont think a woman should be an umpire there are certain things a woman shouldnt be and an umpire is one of them its a physical thing god created women to be feminine i dont think they should be competing with men it has nothing to do with her ability i dont think women should be in any position of leadership i dont think they should be presidents or politicians i think women were created not in an inferior position but in a role of submission to men you can be a woman umpire if you want but that doesnt mean its right you can be a homosexual if you want but that doesnt mean thats right either

4304679 jimmys improved understanding of the offense comes from understanding blitz protection
4304680 as a freshman its really difficult to understand where your hots and your sights are coming from as well as how you have to identify the mike linebacker to protect yourself hes doing a better job with that
4304681 the biggest thing for me last year were the hots and sights when the defense was blitzing
4304682 i really didnt know the protections last year as well as i should have i think i have a good grasp of that now
4304683 jimmy is a good leader because he has an air about him that guys tend to flock to him
4304684 they like being around him they like hanging out with him those are the guys that line up and play with you on every down it carries over from off the field to on the field
4304685 but in order to be a real good quarterback you have to know your limits and just drop the ball down to the back and let the back run around
4304686 its important when the young men play with passion play with emotion play with excitement
4304687 it gives something to your team at the same time when youre playing that way it also builds a little more confidence guys play a little faster when you play with passion
4304688 it comes from the knowledge of the game when you study the game and you understand what your assignments are and youre not thinking about your assignments you understand the three or four things the defense can do to you then you have the opportunity to play a little faster
4304689 when youre playing faster you start playing with excitement you enjoy it youre having fun youre not thinking about what ifs because when youre playing with what ifs you play slower and dont have as much fun because you really arent sure about what may happen and whats going on
4304690 hes done a really good job of stepping in and taking control of the second unit and executing appropriately
4304691 we practice against the new 40 second play clock every day and the other day we had an audible
4304692 sharpley stepped in made the audible real quick changed the cadence and we were off and running that was real impressive im not necessarily sure if that would have happened last year
4304693 morrice has been somewhat of a guesser in the past
4304694 hes got some quickness hes got some speed and instead of taking on people he would swim them and try to make them miss he just wouldnt take on people
4304695 now hes not shying away from contact hes taking on people and still utilizing his quickness hes still coming thats a work in progress well do enough movement to help him but when were not youve got to take them on

4304702 re siemens layoffs the company wont divulge specifics but it sounds like a bloodbath
4304703 re device connectivity a big push over the past few years has been to capture the information to populate flow sheets in the emr with most vendors using capsule the limitation is that once in the emr the information is dated telemedicine jcaho and ihi want systems that immediately respond to changes in a patients condition with central surveillance of devices as a front end technology however many hospitals have through the it department committed their only device output the emr leaving to competition for data access real time is critical for monitoring adverse outcomes so it will be interesting to see how device manufacturers respond i agree that the agnostic middleware vendors will have significant market opportunities

4304751 cuils goal is to solve the two great problems of search how to index the whole internet not just part of it and how to analyze and sort out its pages so you get relevant results
4304752 many web pages are similar to each other or represent auto generated content that isnt very useful to searchers
4304753 cuil prefers to find all the pages with your keyword or phrase and then analyze the rest of the content on those pages during this analysis we discover that your keywords have different meanings in different contexts once weve established the context of the pages were in a much better position to help you in your search
4304754 caldav is an open protocol that allows calendar access via webdav caldav models calendar events as http resources in icalendar format and models calendars containing events as webdav collections this allows you to publish and subscribe to calendars share them collaboratively sync between multiple users and sync between multiple devices
4304755 with caldav support in google calendar youll be able to view and edit your google calendar events directly in ical any changes you make in ical will automatically appear in google calendar the next time you sign in and vice versa if you use ical while offline changes you make will be saved and updated in google calendar when you get back online
4304756 the largest issue that i had is that i needed to create a new caldav server account for every calendar in google calendar not only did this make further setup cumbersome it degraded the ical ui as a 1 1 relationship between each folder server and calendar is created normal re ordering and organization of calendars does not work with this setup so be careful with the order you enter your calendars this multiple server setup also removed the ability to move events between different calendars within ical

4304793 customer service is a problem 18 billions dollars are spent a year on customer services and the experience today is worse than ever partly because consumers can communicate instantaneously its almost telepathic meanwhile to get a simple answer out of a company is like pulling teeth sometimes by the time people get through to someone they feel like they know more about the product or company than the person who answers the help line its also expensive to provide customer services part of the issue is weve learned to think about the problem in the wrong way companies have learned to avoid customers but just a 5 increase in customer attention can increase profits 25 95 depending on your industry customer service is correlated to 50 of company growth

4304809 few people wrote under 100 words some people put tolstoy to shame it seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question
4304810 a lot of people cited the cost of games as a major reason for pirating many were kids with no cash and lots of time to play games but many were not

4304852 kevin rudd in the election campaign promised consultation would be the key to the northern territory intervention but since late january we have seen a procession of bungling bureaucrats descend on elliott making vague contradictory statements that were never going to come to fruition
4304853 the intervention has delivered absolutely zilch to the people of elliott overcrowding of houses continues to contribute to poor health education and social issues if the thrust of the government measures is urbanisation and the demise of small proud towns they are on the mark
4304854 and so we didnt need the government to come in and tell us about alcohol problems of course there are exceptions but aboriginal people in elliot manage their money responsibly and feed and clothe their families as best they can then all of a sudden the government comes along and says were going to take half your money and tell you how to spend it its a bloody insult

4304886 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
4304887 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
4304888 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
4304889 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
4304890 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
4304891 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
4304892 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
4304893 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
4304894 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
4304895 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
4304896 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
4304897 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
4304898 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
4304899 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
4304900 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
4304901 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
4304902 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
4304903 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
4304904 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
4304905 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
4304906 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
4304907 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
4304908 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
4304909 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
4304910 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
4304911 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
4304912 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
4304913 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
4304914 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
4304915 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
4304916 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
4304917 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
4304918 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
4304919 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
4304920 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
4304921 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
4304922 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
4304923 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
4304924 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
4304925 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
4304926 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
4304927 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
4304928 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
4304929 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
4304930 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
4304931 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
4304932 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
4304933 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

4304994 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites
4304995 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
4304996 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon
4304997 as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies
4304998 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting

4305000 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4305001 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4305002 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4305003 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies

4305007 creo que todo es importante y gracias a dios en este momento marchamos con buen paso y esperamos seguir as
4305008 you can learn the features of a language but the way you use those features is an endless series of life lessons
4305009 its going to be tough because at the moment the level is high
4305010 we have to improve our whole package to be fast at every track its only a month since the operation on his hand but i hope it can be better and better because sometimes you can feel pain for longer when you are pushing so hard
4305011 this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win the usgp and with our bike and tyres working very well
4305012 i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again
4305013 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4305014 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4305015 a lo mejor esta muralla me ha dado el poder y la fuerza para lograrlo uno piensa en el enorme trabajo que tuvieron que hacer para construir esto puede que fuera una se al de que yo ten a que hacer lo mismo y lo hice
4305016 simplemente me pregunto c mo encaja todo esto con el solemne compromiso chino de permitirnos trabajar con libertad durante los juegos ol mpicos
4305017 a veces animan demasiado pronto y eso puede perturbar a los deportistas espero que la pr xima vez tengan m s cuidado

4305027 if the original device is not re activated as a wireless phone after youve upgraded to iphone 3g it will still work as an itunes player and can access wi fi
4305028 i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow
4305029 adam is a wily old veteran so he probably wont have any problems
4305030 ill be intrigued to see what christian does he could be the guy who wins the olympics because hes so powerful
4305031 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4305032 you dont generate your own electricity why generate your own computing
4305033 i am 35 and since im not a manager yet my relatives think that im underachiever
4305034 theres a huge amount of research now showing people have a preference for attractive people from birth to death
4305035 babies prefer attractive faces and adults treat attractive babies better
4305036 good looking men and women are generally judged to be more talented kind honest and intelligent than their less attractive counterparts
4305037 controlled studies show people go out of their way to help attractive people of the same and opposite sex because they want to be liked and accepted by good looking people
4305038 our happiness levels seem to be pre set in life
4305039 good relationships can improve happiness but attractive people arent any better at them than others
4305040 actually there is no such thing as altruism everything anybody ever does is done solely for selfish motives sometimes however the selfish motive is just the personal pleasure one might get in helping others but rest assured even in this case the reason the person really helps another is because like everyone else he is always pursuing his own personal interests which just happens to be the good feelings he will derive out of it all
4305041 for the pleasure you will personally get out of it
4305042 altruism is the performance of an unselfish act as a pattern of behaviour this act must have two properties it must benefit someone else and it must do so to the disadvantage of the benefactor it is not merely a matter of being helpful it is helpfulness at a cost to yourself
4305043 when i was young i learned that we are all here to serve other people what i wonder is why the others are here
4305044 when i reluctantly read communist stuff i get the impression that the world for them is divided into bywhoms communists and forwhoms proletariat all the forwhoms are allowed to seek their own happiness but the bywhoms have to put out all their lives to give the forwhoms a chance
4305045 abstainer a weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure
4305046 they are selfishly seeking their own pleasure by means of helping others
4305047 altruism is the main stem of morality and the primary concern of moral principles the landlady says of her student lodgers that they are good boys while knowing full well that they gamble curse drink drive to endanger and consort with loose women what does she mean just that they are reasonably altruistic
4305048 he who does not live in some degree for others hardly lives for himself
4305049 the poor are the only consistent altruists they sell all that they have and give it to the rich
4305050 and now i see the face of god and i raise
4305051 selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live
4305052 the history of the sea teaches that among starving shipwrecked men selfishness is rare and a wonder compelling magnanimity the rule
4305053 we are all here on earth to help others what i cant figure out is what the others are here for
4305054 i am absolutely devastated by the death of that brave young man i obviously owe my life to mr stuckey i cant tell his family how sorry i am for what has happened mr stuckey provided a lifesaving distraction or i wouldnt be here right now
4305055 well theres a chance ill be hurt or killed but probably not and in that case ill have a life time of satisfaction from this incident maybe ill even be a hero although i really dont care either way if this woman lives or dies my calculation shows that its in my own best interests to take a chance so here it goes
4305056 this incident just reaffirms everthing that i knew about michael that he was a selfless and a really wonderful person
4305057 like lots of heroes martin jimenez is brave and lucky
4305058 as a maoist i decided long before then that i was willing whenever necessary to put my life on the line for the masses that means primarily serving the people in maos phrase by being willing to risk my neck in the course of helping the masses build their revolutionary struggle but it also means serving the people by coming to the aid of individuals among the masses when the need presents itself
4305059 if there is something to be said i want it said in the public forum of an open selectmens meeting
4305060 i dont see that this particular power plant is the right project for walpole at this time
4305061 now we have to get our hands around the costs of direct care and ancillary costs
4305062 we drink this water that is coming out of our aquifer
4305063 there was a lot of split a lot of animosity
4305064 there have been too few occasions for citizens to sit down and ask questions
4305065 we need to look at a couple of uses and see if they make sense
4305066 ill be a passionate ally to you guys in walpole
4305067 the post development runoff could not exceed the pre development runoff
4305068 are you nuts you want me to say when im smoking and sipping whiskey with allen whos allen im secretly thinking of you and your dog
4305069 bras and panties and rear ends thats true and babies and marriage certificates and checks
4305070 i cant even understand your question but i want you to understand im an actor
4305071 we cant let these kids go another year with these test scores
4305072 you have to get through the material so they have a fighting chance
4305073 were space pirates think of johnny depp as a romulan
4305074 estoy en la habitaci n 18 en un hotel de mala muerte de la avenida baralt
4305075 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4305076 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4305077 the move by nst to encourage teachers involvement in workshops like this also helps them to develop their teaching skills
4305078 i hope that there will be greater participation from schools in the outskirts of kuala lumpur like sungai penchala and kampung batu and also from smart schools
4305079 currently my school has 50 computers for use by more than 1 000 students
4305080 even though it is a highly beneficial programme there is limited access to computers and students in rural areas often do not have access to the internet
4305081 one of the great things about thintanks is they are there to think the unthinkable
4305082 many of the arguments in this report are completely wrong the author a well respected academic is not a conservative i think hes a members of another political party
4305083 the conservative party doesnt endorse its views far from it
4305084 i think the idea that cities cannot regenerate themselves is just nonsense and i think that people should see this report in that way
4305085 ruin the lives of people destroy their fortunes and it can take years to undo the damage all so she can make a political statement
4305086 shock value has long had its place in political speech
4305087 saat ini setelah saya menimbang matang matang saya tetap berjuang melalui parpol yaitu pkb
4305088 ada yang mengingatkan saya seperti bondan gunawan franz magnis suseno saya jangan ikut partai lagi saya terima itu sebagai masukan
4305089 tapi batin saya mengatakan harus tetap berada di partai karena menurut uu partai itu merupakan wahana untuk melakukan proses demokratisasi
4305090 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4305091 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters it all goes together
4305092 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal grandparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4305093 anybody ask why hellary couldnt keep bj bill satisfied not lesbo or anything is she
4305094 this is what he called it here and really its the same thing and the only variation is this or this to help that type of association
4305095 hey these are the plays we have allocated for you you have to do them
4305096 these are the things were trying to achieve here here are the different ways we can try and achieve them lets do it the best possible way
4305097 ok weve got that lesson weve covered that and now you should be able to play it better
4305098 ok what do i do at the top of my route its cover 2 do i run the middle read do i run the end cut do i run the seven
4305099 i must be dumb because theres a lot of information and its hard to process
4305100 mitt romney is the most likely but i put that at about 25 to 30 percent
4305101 are leaking romney pretty hard to see what the damage will be
4305102 ive kind of written pawlenty off mccain realizes this is really a big change election
4305103 you hear a lot about virginia gov tim kaine right now thats really more of a geographic pick but they seem to really like each other my pick all along for the democrats has been indiana sen evan bayh the hillary supporters really like bayh and hes sort of the perfect safe vp and hes well liked in indiana ohio and michigan
4305104 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
4305105 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
4305106 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
4305107 the dominant figure in my formative years the values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how i go about the world of politics
4305108 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
4305109 we feed you seeking all hs countenance only we wish for no reward nor thanks from you verily we fear from our lord a day hard and distressful that will make the faces look horrible from extreme dislikeness to it so allah saved them from the evil of that day and gave them
4305110 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
4305111 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4305112 the 21st century will require considerable use of nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions theres nothing inherently problematic in doing this
4305113 had a front row seat to witness the failures of this administration
4305114 i am now looking for any team that will give me an opportunity to contribute wherever i am needed
4305115 they have to make sure they stay in shape and they need to be patient
4305116 they can help a team somewhere sometime but the need may not be there right now
4305117 when i consider the pressure expectations and the attention that surrounded me at the time i honestly feel quite unwell
4305118 im so glad i didnt realise the intense public and media interest surrounding me back then as i fear i may have buckled under the massive weight if i had been aware
4305119 they all expect him to get a gold medal thats huge pressure on him
4305120 liu has had intensive training these days to compensate for what he lost due to the shortage of competitions before the olympics
4305121 his injuries have been cured and no longer affect his normal training
4305122 i dont know what makes me so fast and successful
4305123 i know when i see a hurdle in front of me i just attack it
4305124 the races he loses he always hits that last hurdle when he clears it its over
4305125 i always said he was the best 110 hurdler in the world ever since i saw him first run in 2006
4305126 hes got the size 6 3 seven steps to the first hurdle then his lead leg is superfast and active he keeps his trail leg tight
4305127 i feel like im learning from everyday life i feel like im my best therapist
4305128 you always hope to win a championship in anything you do ive been playing sports a long time and through high school and college i never won a championship never won a state championship never won an sec championship never won a national championship
4305129 so to finally do it at the professional level the highest level is a great accomplishment its been a long wait but every year you dont get one it makes you want it more
4305130 i didnt know what i was getting into i was pretty naive if i knew the new york media was like this i might have had a different idea
4305131 but ive never had any doubts or questioned my decisions about that even the tough times i never blamed the media for anything
4305132 i knew i had to play better football i didnt think i was playing great football and they were giving me a bad rap
4305133 i wasnt playing well i knew i wanted to play better i was trying to prove to myself and my teammates that i could play at a high level
4305134 he is a stand up guy if something goes wrong hes going to admit to it and he is going to come back and try harder the next week you are never going to see him hanging his head you are never going to see him giving up
4305135 elis had a lot of good games but theres the yo yo thing there and what youre looking for from that position is consistency
4305136 he made the plays when he had to make them
4305137 hes just becoming more and more aware of what it means to be a quarterback in this league and to have control in all of these situations and know exactly what he wants to do and his teammates have such great belief in him
4305138 he got on a roll and he got confidence once you start winning those close games and your team starts seeing that in you the skys the limit
4305139 you can make some things happen that you didnt know you could make happen
4305140 i think that the changing of the guard was coming last year regardless of certain people still being here or not
4305141 he was the super bowl mvp so this is definitely his team you get the opportunity being around him a lot to see how he looks more comfortable and hes realizing that now
4305142 we dont all get together all that often so it was kind of like old times
4305143 we were going to play golf and watch caddyshack on the portable dvd player
4305144 i dont feel differently maybe someone from the outside could say something different but i dont feel ive changed
4305145 im still a humble person i still look forward to practice i still get upset when we have bad plays i still prepare the same way from a football standpoint im doing things the same and preparing to get better
4305146 i dont think a quarterback reaches his full potential until his sixth or seventh year elis going into his fifth year
4305147 this guy can get better and he wants to get better and he works on things he has to get better at
4305148 no one can take it away but it isnt like youre finished that youve done everything you can do it was fun
4305149 you want to relive that experience and have that journey again i think we have a lot more to prove i have a lot more to prove
4305150 youve got to hold the iphone like you would hold your lover gently yet firmly
4305151 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4305152 when you come across something like this it sends a tingle up your spine
4305153 i have never seen such an exceptional site as gobero it is actually eight sites where people not only buried their dead but actually lived as well
4305154 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
4305155 todays multi billion dollar agreements are the latest victories for investors seeking relief from the collapse of the auction rate securities market which has left a stranglehold on billions of dollars
4305156 the fundamental goal has been to return money into the hands of investors and thats what these deals do
4305157 a bid came in and it was immediately rejected manchester city officials have been advised that the player would not be for sale and we are very disappointed they have continued their interest
4305158 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance maybe the stories of the financial crisis flying around are not as substantiated as they should be
4305159 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
4305160 for the record russia won the recent battle against georgia but lost the war the war is russia against all of her neighbors by continuously ticking off all of her neighbors russia is causing them to fight back any way they can eventually russia will die the death of a thousand cuts russias thug economy wont be strong enough to handle this war long term especially when energy prices drop
4305161 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4305162 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4305163 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4305164 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancer than all the other gene mutations discovered so far the reasonable expectation is that this will save some lives
4305165 if confirmed in larger studies this finding brings us another step closer towards unravelling the inherited risk of bowel cancer
4305166 our growing understanding of bowel cancer genetics could ultimately lead to new tests to identify and monitor people who are at a greater risk of developing the disease
4305167 licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies
4305168 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4305169 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
4305170 new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce
4305171 i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research
4305172 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering
4305173 i have been a fan of dark alley medias fisting movies for such a long time
4305174 i wrote them personally and told them i was going to turn down every offer i got for a scene like that until they let me do a movie for them shooting tattoo twinks with them was so hot it was seriously one of my biggest dreams come true since starting to work in this industry
4305175 he has been wanting to get down and dirty with dark alley media for many months
4305176 we finally found the perfect role for him getting to punch fuck brett redman watching young guys get really into fisting is something special
4305177 oh damn there goes another one how soon do we port so joe can be replaced
4305178 umm captain that was a her and her name was betty

4305180 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among pre school children
4305181 the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4305182 there may well be some other common factor in obesity
4305183 in terms of tonsillectomies these are frequently given to children with breathing problems such as sleep apnoea which is certainly linked to being overweight in adults and may be linked to weight in children
4305184 it is possible for there to be a link between otitis externa a different form of ear infection and obesity because of the connection between obesity and type ii diabetes which can contribute to this condition
4305185 a connection is not impossible but to be frank is extremely unlikely
4305186 i think the viewers should be able to understand that in the national
4305187 but we also believe strongly in ensuring strong and visionary leadership for the peoples university i cannot stress enough the importance of memorial university to the educational social and economic future of newfoundland and labrador just as the board of regents has an obligation and a duty to find the appropriate candidate so does the government as mandated by the memorial university act we take this obligation seriously
4305188 to get more involved with government to promote the interests of the province
4305189 so wheres the in out scam in the local headlines
4305190 this project is an example of harvesters taking a direct role in the stewardship of the fishery and having input into the management of the resource
4305191 as such our government is pleased to approve funding for this initiative this is important work because it is the most extensive attempt to date to profile lobster stocks

4305193 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today
4305194 we wish chris nothing but the best and look forward to all that mike will do in a role in which he has excelled at for years
4305195 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4305196 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4305197 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4305198 antagonistic degrading or demeaning conduct in the workplace that is directed at or about ones religious faith or ancestry can be discriminatory and can amount to an unlawful hostile environment
4305199 after their operative theory couldnt even withstand the scrutiny of the dfhs in the world they revised their theory
4305200 if it had to be a foreigner couldnt it have been a german
4305201 my experience of managers in england was not that positive unfortunately at nottingham forest i had two different managers whom i would call typical old fashioned english managers
4305202 there is not a good reputation for old fashioned british coaches except for bobby robson because of his personality if you look around there are simply not that many of them abroad
4305203 with no disrespect they were more like socialisers hanging out with the lads but now things have changed i think steve mcclaren can do a good job
4305204 he was interested in the passion and succeeded really well in bringing some of that back
4305205 i always wanted to work abroad to experience different countries
4305206 holland has always been a respected football country in england they produce good footballers and good coaches i am only six weeks here but now i know why you can see why holland has a conveyer belt of talent
4305207 that is in the past i am not worried about my image i know what i have done in the past and this is a new adventure for me
4305208 i am not proving anything although maybe i am proving to myself i am one of those coaches who can travel abroad
4305209 i am trying to learn dutch but my priority is learning the football
4305210 i have put a lot of pressure on myself coming here for me it is no different managing fc twente to managing england or to managing middlesbrough there is always pressure and everyone is always looking at you to deliver results

4305214 during the bid i said the olympic games would help china open up
4305215 after 30 years of reform china has developed greatly people enjoy more freedom they have a lot of say their economic welfare has improved a lot
4305216 but you have to follow legal procedures we cannot take the country into chaos a few people come here to be critical and dig into the small details but that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promises the games will open the horizons about china and people will see it for themselves
4305217 there were certainly some hopes and aspirations outlined in 2001 about how the games could have an impact on china
4305218 we have to note there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas the world is watching and there will be commentaries made appraising how the games have an impact
4305219 we are very pleased with how the organizers are putting on a good sporting event the iocs remit is to bring sport and the olympic values to the country
4305220 the media should be allowed to do their jobs reporting on the games
4305221 the ioc does disapprove of any attempt to hinder a journalist doing his job
4305222 the one thing i want to make sure we do is make sure kurt gets some time with the first team
4305223 im not ready just yet not financially and not personally
4305224 despite everything i believe that people are really good at heart
4305225 epic is a legendary studio that is synonymous with quality and ea partners jumped at the chance to team up with them on the launch of their next blockbuster ip
4305226 ea partners is committed to giving the worlds best independent developers access to eas global publishing resources letting them focus on what they do best making great games
4305227 well im always open to making exceptions and i definitely would for you
4305228 my ideas and decisions will come from the perspective of someone that has firsthand experience working in the classroom and whose own children are currently attending moorpark schools
4305229 parents should have a greater voice in the district policies and schools need to be accountable to the community for every decision they make
4305230 if elected i will seek to ensure that any cuts made are those that are the furthest away from the students and classrooms
4305231 when the district implemented a change in schedule to include a late start day rather than an early dismissal day for secondary schools last year the change lacked support from many parents yet the district chose to implement the late start day again this year
4305232 all schools are doing really well and as a school board member i would want to work to continue that excellence in this time when budget cuts have to be made
4305233 i understand the importance of obtaining a good education and the successes that come from it and want to make sure that each child of moorpark receives an education that will help him or her succeed in life
4305234 i am running to provide needed leadership and accountability to the school board in a time of fiscal crisis and i seek to create an environment that will help ensure that every child in moorpark receives an education that will allow them the opportunity to reach their fullest potential
4305235 since decisions about schools can have an impact on the entire community it is important to have increased involvement by local residents and to openly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the schools
4305236 i realize the importance of having a mentor in ones life and the significant positive impact that they can make
4305237 i love this city and i think this is one of the greatest cities in the entire world not only because of location but families and people here have a big heart for the city and they enjoy living here
4305238 i enjoy reading and im self taught in a lot of things i do
4305239 every single person in the city has good ideas and valid opinions
4305240 helps a lot of people out and he will be able to lead us in the right direction
4305241 the one thing i want to make sure we do is make sure kurt gets some time with the ones and i think the best way to control that is to start him in the game
4305242 you just dont know how playing time will play out because we havent decided how long our offensive line is going to go yet
4305243 coach to his credit from day one told me it was a competition

4305279 austins a good running back because he understands his position and space on the field
4305280 its been great watching his speed develop as well hes patient enough to slow down and look for a hole when needed but he also knows how to turn it up a notch
4305281 the biggest factor in edmonson making the jump to varsity was his maturity level
4305282 obviously he showed the skills it took to get the job done his first year but ultimately in the end the decision was based mostly on his maturity
4305283 i was surprised yeah when coach kidder told me i was going to varsity but more than anything i was just anxious
4305284 i didnt know how good i would be and i wanted to make sure i helped the team
4305285 varsity was different from freshman ball because varsity was faster and you had to learn more plays
4305286 i had a lot of good coaches however and once i started to grasp the playbook i felt more confident in myself
4305287 its going to be a little different this year more balanced for sure
4305288 edmonson is still going to be a big weapon for us and the fact that hes able to catch the ball out of the backfield makes him even more dangerous
4305289 when i first started here a lot of people told me that i had some big shoes to fill
4305290 but scott and i are two completely different people and two different types of running backs i cant fill his shoes he took his shoes theyre gone

4305317 our goal here is to spread the pain as people are saying and to continue the concept of shared responsibility which we think is part of the reason why massachusetts has been successful
4305318 we had the advantage of having a pot of money that was already available to be able to redirect to the reform efforts to cover more people
4305319 we also had a relatively low level of people without health insurance so there was sort of a less steep hill to climb
4305320 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4305321 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4305322 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents

4305330 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future

4305335 a lot of kids play basketball at a young age but as they get older the attention and the facilities are not there so they go in a different direction
4305336 i believe the game is growing here in the uk which is going to help a lot of kids with a lot of talent so hopefully theyll have a brighter future
4305337 we have the talent and the pieces to qualify head coach chris finch seems excited at the position were in
4305338 one of the things were missing in our programme is a collective experience of basketball at the top level were going for wins and qualification for 2009 2011 and then the next olympics
4305339 the general public has never had the opportunity to see these talented youngsters with great stories that the country could really get behind i think they will do us proud
4305340 i am happy that i get to stay with the chicago bulls and that the organisation has that much trust in me
4305341 with new staff we feel like the chemistry is going to be better so we are looking forward to it
4305342 so far he has been great at communicating with all of us everybody is talking about him being a first time coach but the organisation has done a great job and brought in good staff around him with a lot of experience so that should help him out a lot
4305343 i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow

4305347 we have to improve our whole package to be fast at every track its only a month since the operation on his hand but i hope it can be better and better because sometimes you can feel pain for longer when you are pushing so hard

4305372 it is significant because it is a private public partnership between the cities of savage and burnsville the state of minnesota and kraemer mining and materials
4305373 it will treat 4 million gallons of quarry water a day from the quarry that would otherwise be lost to the minnesota river
4305374 nothing exemplifies our commitment to being naturally resourceful more than the burnsville surface water treatment plant project
4305375 well have more water for days when the usage is at its highest and at the same time well be able to reduce our reliance on the wells that draw from the aquifers from the savage fen burnsville fen and of course our eagle creek
4305376 the water can be pumped to lakeville or eagan or somebody else if it is appropriate
4305377 we do have pipes that go to lakeville for example that could be used if credit river becomes a city and cant go down for water they could conceivably buy from this supply
4305378 years ago we had long term planning where we realized that the management of the water that we discharge was going to become a factor and the efficiencies in our operations were going to be impacted by that

4305386 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4305387 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4305388 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4305389 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4305390 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4305391 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4305392 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4305393 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4305394 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4305395 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4305396 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4305397 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4305398 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4305399 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4305400 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4305401 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4305402 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4305403 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4305404 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4305405 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4305406 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4305407 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4305408 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero

4305411 dalam semester pertama tahun ini harga minyak meningkat di atas 40 persen sehingga mencapai 147 dollar as per barel namun juli dan awal agustus ini harga minyak tiba tiba merosot hingga 20 persen sehingga menjadi di bawah 115 dolar as per barel

4305413 he explained to the teller he would hurt her if she didnt give him the money
4305414 maybe hes a working person who is off on fridays or he chooses to rob a bank on a friday thinking there may be more money that he could obtain
4305415 he didnt say anything didnt notice anything unusual i figured hes got a backpack he just looked like he was a normal guy and then next thing you know wow he robbed the bank in front of me
4305416 based on his pattern we would rather take that risk of getting information out there and possibly getting him identified or captured rather than tip him off to anything and have him move to another area

4305425 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4305426 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4305427 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4305428 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4305429 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4305430 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4305431 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing

4305439 both v8 engines are good choices but for overall power cost and fuel economy wed opt for the 5 7 liter hemi

4305445 the new generation 4 7 liter v8 is expected to have fuel economy similar to the hemi
4305446 big vented discs with twin piston calipers in front just the thing for holding back this heavy beast
4305447 is a little too inclined to edge out of its lane
4305448 the steering is pretty impressive for a vehicle of this size with good response and feedback that allow the driver to make exact lane changes and easily negotiate tight turns
4305449 in spite of its large size the 2008 dodge durango delivers a satisfying balance between a smooth composed ride and crisp handling through corners

4305476 backing both engines is a five speed automatic transmission delivering power via 2wd or 4wd
4305477 rear wheel drive is standard and two four wheel drive systems are available
4305478 that helps the hemi achieve slightly better fuel economy than the less powerful standard engine
4305479 ride is smooth and handling is quite respectable for an suv weighing 2 5 tons
4305480 too big to be agile the aspen nonetheless handles with sure stability and that includes during towing
4305481 can feel a bit loose and the brake pedal feels vague with lengthy stopping distances
4305482 aspen has good grip and modest lean in corners impressive for a vehicle this large and heavy
4305483 steering would benefit from less power assist and more road feel
4305484 left relatively impressed with the aspens round town demeanor the ride quality being nowhere near as brittle as we expected given the rugged suspension architecture and big wheels
4305485 the aspen seats seven occupants in three rows although an available third row bench seat bumps capacity to eight
4305486 aspen doesnt have a bad seat in the house if your passengers complain it will be about your driving not their accommodations
4305487 moving about the this 2008 chrysler cabin doesnt demand the nimbleness of a gymnast
4305488 the seats are fixed in place so legrooms still tight
4305489 maximum cargo capacity is impressive at over 102 cubic feet with all rear seats folded
4305490 a bit less than the ford expedition and chevy tahoe which both have around 110 cubic feet
4305491 that the automatic liftgate lacks a tailgate button for power close
4305492 plenty of in cabin storage including a deep center console and large useful console tray

4305511 dollar for dollar the m35 provides a far richer powerband than competitors
4305512 the m35s 3 5 liter v6 and the m45s 4 5 liter v 8 are enthusiastic albeit somewhat thirsty powerplants
4305513 the m35s v6 should provide more than enough power for most drivers
4305514 churns out fluid power with no peaky burst or low end sluggishness and under hard acceleration its high pitched whine should be music to any gearhead
4305515 it trades the m35s finesse for brute hang the tail out power at pretty much any speed
4305516 with 275 horsepower and 268 lb ft of torque the v6 propels an m35 from 0 to 60 in just over 6 seconds or slightly more for the heavier awd m35x rated at 325 horsepower and 336 lb ft of torque the larger v8 in the m45 drops that interval into the mid to high five second range
4305517 the m continues with the same five speed automatic although with playful rev matching this at a time when the rest of the biz is going to six plus speed automatics
4305518 it works just as well if not better it holds lower gears tenaciously at lower speeds refusing the mileage bait of an early upshift while youre still on the gas
4305519 rear drive m35s averaged 16 4 mpg m35x models averaged 17 4 21 2 mpg with mostly highway use test m45s averaged 16 mpg in mixed driving
4305520 advanced suspension design that responds with just the right mix of compliance and firmness
4305521 base m35 and m45 absorb bumps best m35x has tauter suspension settings resulting in a slightly less compliant ride
4305522 nissans outstanding awd system can seamlessly transfer torque from rear to front and side to side as conditions warrant making it a feature well worth considering for those who live outside of the sun belt
4305523 a 50 50 front rear power split can be locked in via the snow mode button on the center console
4305524 varies the geometry of the rear wheels to deliver even more immediate and positive reactions during spirited cornering
4305525 all told the steering feel encourages twisty road driving in a way a mercedes e class cannot body roll remains well in check and at its limits the m displays good grip and even better balance
4305526 seat is firm and nicely contoured but the cushion is not long enough for optimal thigh support
4305527 cabin trim aluminum or optional wood is the real deal not synthetic
4305528 power reclining and heated rear seats rear audio controls and a rear sunshade
4305529 four of the five ms seats offer ample legroom and headroom but the bulky floor hump in back means a fifth passenger has to share foot room
4305530 after you park the steering wheel automatically powers upward to ease exit and entry and does so much faster than in some of the ms crankier peers
4305531 theres good trunk volume and lid hinges dont intrude but short aperture means drawer like access
4305532 a pull down center armrest in the rear conceals a modest pass through opening to the ms 14 9 cubic foot trunk
4305533 the quality of materials is a bit uneven and we find that the layout of the center stack controls isnt as clean and intuitive as it could be
4305534 there are leather wrappings around the door pulls and chrome runners along the steering wheel
4305535 it is somewhat less peaceful than other performance luxury cruisers
4305536 as at highway speeds the infiniti m35 also exhibits a noticeable amount of engine and road noise
4305537 lane departure prevention applies individual brakes to nudge the car back on course
4305538 standard safety features include six airbags with side airbags for the front seats and side curtain ones for both rows as well as four wheel disc abs traction control and en electronic stability system front seat occupants have active head restraints and pre crash seat belts
4305539 you get adaptive cruise control preview braking and lane departure warning adaptive cruise control uses a laser beam to judge the distance to the car ahead and apply modest gas or brakes to maintain a proper distance preview braking uses the same lasers to sense any oncoming obstructions including a rapidly slowing vehicle and it will alert the driver with an audio chime and pre load the brakes for sharper response lane departure prevention applies individual brakes to nudge the car back on course
4305540 shows the view behind the car when the transmission is in reverse
4305541 bi xenon adaptive front lighting is optional in the m35x but standard on all other m models and their brilliant blue white beams provide an even better look at what lies ahead
4305542 tiered option groups allow the personalization of any m model with the best of everything available from infiniti
4305543 the sport package is available only on the rwd models
4305544 complementing leather and wood or aluminum trim a bounty of power assists plus dual zone climate control 160 watt am fm cd mp3 audio with six disc changer intelligent key remote locking and ignition one touch power moonroof and a power tilt and telescoping steering column

4305550 dual screen rear seat dvd video systems heated and power reclining rear seats and rear air conditioning
4305551 weighty doors and cushy leather but too many shoddy finishes
4305552 edgy styling of the cts and xlr cars youll like the 2008 cadillac sts
4305553 the sts isnt quite ready for a complete revamp yet
4305554 luxury buyers should be pleased with this cadillacs generally high class ambience
4305555 the usual color choices of black tan or gray are offset by the occasional use of nice wood trim a sprayed on urethane skin gives the dash and door panels a rich look mimicking real leather
4305556 worry how well this material will hold up over time
4305557 the sts v6 is basically as quick as the unchanged sts v8
4305558 manual shift mode but like most it takes a moment or two to induce a shift
4305559 the computer thinks the car needs a downshift its quick to override any actions to the contrary
4305560 fuel economy proved surprisingly good especially on long highway trips
4305561 all versions deliver a fairly smooth ride with reasonably sporty handling
4305562 sts tracked brilliantly in tight turns though the steering response was somewhat soft and slow to react
4305563 some testers feel hemmed in by the wide center console and high windowsills
4305564 the standard power tilt and telescopic steering wheel helps dial in a comfortable driving stance
4305565 trunk space is unexceptional for stss exterior size a small opening limits the size of items that can be loaded
4305566 small item storage is limited to a smallish center console and less than generous glove box
4305567 most of the flaws could have been fixed with a modest freshening something on par with what the outside received
4305568 interior materials quality is good when compared to domestic branded premium sedans but falls just shy of the standards set by german and japanese rivals
4305569 road and wind noise are both well muted the new v6 sounds refined when accelerating and is otherwise quieter than the engine it replaces
4305570 brakes on the sts are up to the cars potential
4305571 the only to benefit are those who shouldnt be on the road
4305572 rear radio controls wireless cell phone link head up instrument display heated washer nozzles and automatic dimming headlights
4305573 a super cool looking car that afforded me several head nods
4305574 the avengers strong rear shoulders squarish taillamps and sloping roofline are all grafted with varying exactness from the dodge charger large sedan
4305575 the avenger is one of the few distinctive designs in the saturated midsize sedan market
4305576 its styling falls in line with other dodge models meaning it has substance and character that wont wilt in the sun
4305577 some hard and glossy plastics and copious amounts of faux metal
4305578 ready to challenge just about any other v 6 in this category
4305579 with the 4 cylinder avenger struggles in passing and merging
4305580 thoroughly up to the task of getting the avenger up to speed
4305581 hotted up version sporting the 3 5 liter six will make 235 hp and 232 lb ft of twist
4305582 but with this engine the avenger feels much stronger during highway maneuvers
4305583 acceleration isnt as effortless upshifts arent as smooth and highway cruising isnt quite as relaxed
4305584 the six speed automatic is smooth and fast reacting especially in manual mode
4305585 front drive r t averaged a disappointing 17 7 mpg the awd r t didnt fare much better averaging 18 2 mpg
4305586 handing is compromised by artificial feeling steering and surprising body lean in corners r t models demonstrate somewhat improved steering feel and better overall grip but fall short of sporty pretensions even with all wheel drive
4305587 reason to get the r t is its upgraded suspension tuning which provides more responsive and secure handling on back roads along with a composed highway ride
4305588 avenger r t doesnt have the reflexes of a nissan altima se
4305589 the avengers cabin is spacious enough for two six foot two inch occupants to sit one behind the other in comfort
4305590 limited to a too narrow center console and smallish glovebox
4305591 interior accoutrements include a bevy of delightful beverage centric items including the chill zone storage compartment mounted in the dash and the heated cooled cup holders
4305592 the avengers interior is long on creature features but short on quality the center storage console feels and sounds a bit cheap when you open and close it
4305593 r t has upgraded trim which with the available leather seating somewhat improves the interior ambiance
4305594 although not exactly premium in feel the avengers cabin is a step up from the outgoing stratus
4305595 lack of suspension refinement contributes to excess of creaks and groans over poor road surfaces
4305596 electronic stability system is standard on the r t awd and optional on the front drive r t and the sxt
4305597 includes front front side and side curtain airbags but not anti lock brakes
4305598 an electronic stability system is standard on the dodge avenger r t awd and optional on the front drive r t and the sxt for 425 there is no traction control in dodge avenger without the stability system
4305599 had its pros and cons the lower anchors of the dodge avengers system were a pain to hook and unhook although the hinged rotating covers on the top tether anchors were simple and much appreciated
4305600 thick roof pillars and lack of a rear quarter window severely compromise rear visibility
4305601 sxts and r ts have a healthy list of options
4305602 mygig system allows storage of up to 20 gb of music
4305603 they do work in that they get cold or hot depending on the setting you choose
4305604 a worthy feature at this price level and in this segment
4305605 optional navigation system has a touch screen which is better than an advanced multifunction controller
4305606 if youre looking for high fashion youre shopping in the wrong vehicle class
4305607 crisp and contemporary perhaps a little more interesting than the hyundai entourage 2008 is a
4305608 if youre looking for high fashion youre shopping in the wrong vehicle class
4305609 except for details of the grille headlamps and lower air intake up front not much differentiates the entourage from minivans on the road
4305610 stripped down 2008 hyundai gls models velour style upholstery which appears on the door panels in addition to the seats
4305611 gives the cabin a warmer feel than some of the new woven cloth fabrics that are spreading throughout the market
4305612 fuzzy suede like fabric in the handsome two tone interior
4305613 the automatic transmission is sometimes slow to downshift for extra power
4305614 a huge step in addressing gas mileage and pollution emissions
4305615 is certainly quick enough though it wont be setting any records despite having a large engine
4305616 underscores that engine ratings arent the last word in how a model performs
4305617 entourage and sedona accelerate strongly from a stop a brisk 8 4 sec 0 60 mph
4305618 the 2008 hyundais capable v6 accelerates this minivan smartly and provides ample power around town and on the highway
4305619 five speed automatic can be shifted manually by tapping the gear shift lever useful in mountain driving when the driver could easily shift to a lower gear helping to slow the vehicle
4305620 does its job admirably and it includes a clutchless manual feature standard in case you want to pretend youre in something other than a minivan
4305621 rolling acceleration can seem sluggish because the automatic transmission is sometimes slow to downshift for extra power and the transmission isnt always quick to follow manual gear changes
4305622 the transmission operates smoothly in most situations but its response can be a bit lazy at times
4305623 entourage has no barge like tendencies when it comes to handling a lovely highway cruiser quiet and stable
4305624 handles rough surfaces well but a particularly deep pothole sends a quiver through the body that suggests the structure isnt as solid as it could be
4305625 handles well enough with notable push or understeer when taking corners too fast
4305626 the ride is comfortable for a minivan but is not quite carlike the suspension is generally composed and smoothes out small bumps well but it bounces some over larger humps
4305627 handling dynamics arent eager or precise as it exhibits a somewhat slow steering response and more understeer and body roll than youll find among its segment leading rivals
4305628 steering is confident and positive with satisfying feel and feedback to maneuver neatly around town
4305629 theres ample headroom and legroom is decent for a 6 foot adult when the seat is slid back all the way
4305630 flexibility is a good thing for anybody planning to sit in the third row which is designed for small to mid size children
4305631 standard drivers seat had a manual jack style height adjustment which is a breeze to use when seated
4305632 141 cubic feet of total cargo room available just a bit less than other mainstream minivans
4305633 well behind the 3rd row seat is a useful cargo hold and the seat sections fold into it easily for even more space
4305634 second row seats tumble and fold for generous load volume
4305635 there are decent door pockets with integral bottle holders a total of four cupholders including a drawer and the flip up tray between the seats two overhead sunglass holders and two glove compartments
4305636 leather upholstery on the limited model contributes to the feeling that the hyundai entourage 2008 is aimed at some pampering and not just day to day transportation
4305637 full of blank buttons those placeholders that show where you would control a feature that you dont have
4305638 the 2008 hyundai cabin is short on soft touch surfaces and long on nondescript plastics but the materials are mostly in line with pricing
4305639 some test examples of both entourage and sedona annoyed with creaking interior panels and rattling 2nd and 3rd row seats
4305640 the engine emits a full throttle growl but is reasonably quiet otherwise
4305641 tire thrum and some body rumble is noticed even in town driving and wind rush joins in at highway speeds
4305642 offers the same kind of safety equipment youll find on the odyssey and sienna
4305643 has the best crash safety ratings any minivan has yet earned
4305644 established life savers that come standard on the hyundai entourage 2008 include electronic stability control to control skids and anti lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist side impact air bags inflate from the front seats for torso protection and air curtains cover the side windows for vital head protection in a rollover or side impact crash front seat active head restraints move forward in a rear end crash to minimize whiplash injuries
4305645 the thick windshield pillars can impede visibility to the front corners but there are clear sightlines elsewhere
4305646 last years mid level 2008 hyundai se has been dropped in favor of more generous option packages for the base level gls while this years limited comes with more standard features and fewer options
4305647 comes with many of the most important features including high value equipment like six airbags and an electronic stability system
4305648 more standard features come on the 2008 hyundai se and limited versions which are competitive with similarly priced competitors
4305649 trim options include an ultimate package which gets you a sunroof a rear seat entertainment system a power front passenger seat power adjustable foot pedals an auto dimming rearview mirror and a driver seat memory system
4305650 the hyundai entourage 2008 limited model adds the rear seat entertainment system plus tilt slide glass sunroof power front passenger seat power adjustable foot pedals integrated memory system for the drivers seat outside mirrors and foot pedals and an auto dimming rearview mirror with homelink

4305668 nimble and balanced helped by precise linear steering with good road feel
4305669 braking on all is stable but be sure to get abs
4305670 the 3 s grand touring runs circles around its competitors and perhaps most impressive is the mazdas 60 to 0 mph which at 112 feet matches that of the all new pontiac g8 gt
4305671 nothing else in this field feels so lively and well planted you can feel the racing dna in the 3s bones
4305672 even taller drivers will find plenty of room in this compact cars front seat
4305673 the rear seat is a little snug for larger adults but those of average height will find a decent amount of space

4305675 offer 11 4 cu ft of trunk space while the hatchback boasts 31 when the seats are folded
4305676 sedans have 11 5 cu ft while hatchbacks offer 43 8 cu ft with their rear seats folded down

4305699 generates more interest among observers than some that cost 10 times as much
4305700 silver or black strip that loops around the fortwos side
4305701 unique but not as quirky as the cars exterior design might lead you to expect
4305702 relatively compact instrument panel and open space where youd expect a center console all contribute to an interior that feels less confined than that of the significantly longer and wider mini cooper
4305703 the cabin has a cartoonish look with dimpled upholstery on the dashboard and kitschy plastic air conditioning controls
4305704 there are a number of monochromatic and two tone interior options available to liven things up
4305705 feels woefully lackluster and a little worrisome on the highway
4305706 1 0 liter three cylinder engine that produces 71 hp and 68 pound feet of torque
4305707 acceleration is sluggish from a stop and is plagued by annoying bogging and surging at every shift
4305708 qualify it as one of the slowest new vehicles on the road
4305709 maintaining 65 mph is within the realm of long haul plausibility
4305710 climbing an incline at that speed or accelerating to anything higher is dicey
4305711 is shifted without a clutch pedal via a simple console mounted stick and column mounted paddles on passion models
4305712 a dog off the dime and characterized by the most laughingly goofy gaps between shifts
4305713 the fortwo can be driven more quickly but it takes a lot of concentration
4305714 stiff and choppy over all but glass smooth roads with sharp bumps and expansion cracks causing abrupt vertical motions
4305715 high speed stability is also pretty good although strong crosswinds can wreak havoc on its boxy shape
4305716 handling largely depends on how one equips the smart fortwo
4305717 a base pure model with manual steering and narrow 15 inch front tires feels ponderous
4305718 upgrading to power steering and wider tires provides a more adept driving experience and actually makes zipping through city streets fun
4305719 in parking lots where the cars micro measurements and sub 30 foot turning circle combine to deliver an almost comical sense of agility
4305720 maybe the storage space eight cubic feet of a supermarket grocery cart
4305721 certainly snug the smart fortwo offers a surprising amount of space for two people
4305722 narrow cabin means two adults ride almost shoulder to shoulder
4305723 lack of a tilt steering column may compromise comfort for some drivers
4305724 cargo room in back measures just 7 8 cubic feet less than a third the space the cooper offers behind its front seats
4305725 tiny glovebox offers barely enough space for an owners manual
4305726 overall ambiance is budget with lots of hard plastic and very few padded surfaces
4305727 engine note is always audible and rises to a loud groan under acceleration
4305728 during the side impact test the driver door unlatched and opened
4305729 allows the smart car to withstand impacts as well or better than much larger cars

4305737 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4305738 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4305739 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4305740 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4305741 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing
4305742 most of the effects of low oxygen on fish stocks are what we call sub lethal
4305743 it doesnt kill the fish but stresses them it affects their growth it reduces their reproductive output and makes them more susceptible to disease

4305749 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4305750 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4305751 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4305752 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government

4305762 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
4305763 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
4305764 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
4305765 but we dont do our european publicity junkets until next week
4305766 i too would not accept a renewed appointment from the unelected military government as the risk to the maintenance of the rule of law was too great a price to pay
4305767 accepting appointment to the highest court of that country by a military government the lawfulness of which is under significant challenge comes at too high a price
4305768 i decided to stay throughout 2007 for as long as i had judicial effect
4305769 i also then decided that i could not renew my warrant in 2008 if the military regime was still in power as to do so would run contrary to my original oath of office
4305770 my role as legal services commissioner is to investigate complaints about lawyers and i have to do this in accordance with the law
4305771 whether behaviour amounts to misconduct is determined by the legal test for professional misconduct prescribed by the legal profession act 2004 and also by previous cases
4305772 my role is simply to determine whether the facts of any complaint satisfy these tests and whether a disciplinary tribunal is likely to find misconduct
4305773 conduct which may provoke community disapproval does not necessarily meet these tests
4305774 they have promulgated many convenient laws and regulations to suit their revolutionary cause including on occasion legislating away the courts judgments
4305775 in so doing they undermine the rule of law by eroding confidence in the fairness predictability and transparency of justice

4305800 weve been able to use magnetic nanoparticles to capture free floating cancer cells and then take them out of the body
4305801 this technology may be of special importance in the treatment of ovarian cancer where the malignancy is typically spread by free floating cancer cells released from the primary tumor into the abdominal cavity
4305802 if the therapy is able to pass further tests that show it can prevent the cancer from spreading from the original tumor
4305803 if you modify the nanoparticle and target it directly to the tumor cells using a small peptide you are less likely to generate an undesirable immune response and more accurately target the cells of interest

4305812 beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadhan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang hak dan yang bathil karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya pada hari hari yang lain allah menghendaki kemudahan bagimu dan tidak menghendaki kesukaran bagimu dan hendaklah kamu mencukupkan bilangannya dan hendaklah kamu mengagungkan allah atas petunjuk nya yang diberikan kepadamu supaya kamu bersyukur

4305824 puasa adalah perisai seorang hamba berperisai dengannya dari api neraka

4305832 dan sempurnakanlah olehmu ibadah haji dan umrah karena allah maka jika kamu terkepung terhalang oleh musuh atau sakit maka wajib menyembelih kurban yang mudah didapat dan janganlah kamu mencukur rambut kepalamu hingga kurban itu sampai ke tempat penyembelihannya jika ada diantaramu yang sakit atau ada gangguan di kepalanya lalu ia bercu kur maka wajib atasnya berfidyah yaitu berpuasa atau bersedekah atau berkurban apabila kamu telah merasa aman maka bagi siapa yang ingin mengerjakan umrah sebelum haji di dalam bulan haji wajiblah ia menyembelih kurban yang mudah di dapat tetapi jika ia tidak menemukan binatang kurban atau tidak mampu maka wajib berpuasa tiga hari dalam masa haji dan tujuh hari lagi apabila kamu telah pulang kembali demikian itu kewajiban membayar fidyah bagi orang orang yang keluargannya tidak berada di sekitar masjidil haram orang orang yang bukan penduduk kota makkah dan bertakwalah kepada allah dan ketahuilah bahwa allah sangat keras siksa nya
4305833 dan jika ia si terbunuh dari kaum kafir yang ada perjanjian damai antara mereka dengan kamu maka hendaklah si pembunuh membayar diat denda yang diserahkan kepada keluarganya si terbunuh serta memerdekakan hamba sahaya yang mukmin barangsiapa yang tidak memperolehnya maka hendaklah si pembunuh berpuasa dua bulan berturut turut sebagai cara taubat kepada allah dan adalah allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
4305834 allah tidak menghukum kamu disebabkan sumpah sumpahmu yang tidak dimaksud untuk bersumpah tetapi dia menghukum kamu disebabkan sumpah sumpah kamu yang kamu sengaja maka kafarat melanggar sumpah itu ialah memberi makan sepuluh orang miskin yaitu dari makanan yang biasa kamu berikan kepada keluargamu atau memberi pakaian kepada mereka atau memerdekakan seorang budak

4305838 sesunguhnya allah memaafkan bagi umatku apa yang terbetik dalam hatinya selama belum diucapkan atau diamalkannya

4305843 saya memang mengatakan bahwa pesta olimpiade yang masuk ke cina akan membantu cina membuka diri lebih lebar lagi dan reformasi yang lebih bagus
4305844 saya kira cina telah menunjukkan kemajuan dan kalau kita tanya orang awam di jalan jalan mereka akan memberikan jawaban yang sama
4305845 semua orang senang orang merasa optimis tentang masa depan mereka itu fakta
4305846 ideals defined by matrices and a certain complex associated with them
4305847 oh yeah oh my god baby that feels so good
4305848 what is it baby do you want this do you want me to fuck you with this big cock do you want to feel this inside of you huh is that what you want
4305849 yeah i do baby thats just how i like it
4305850 we want to stabilize the building thats the main thing
4305851 were all kind of curious about exactly what theyre going to do to it
4305852 its also one of the most painted every painter who comes here wants to paint this church
4305853 were running ads asking for people to show us their photos from inside the church

4305856 drilling i believe in more american production we need to have more american production and that is why i led the charge in the senate to have 8 3 million new acres in the gulf of mexico available
4305857 there isnt a person in the world im not talking about politicians im talking about oil people will tell you that drilling will lower the price of oil it takes at least 15 years before drill a hole today in the ocean 15 years before it would be in someones gas tank
4305858 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4305859 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the ceasefire agreement to be honoured
4305860 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks
4305861 while the case certainly looks sharp and may affect cooling for the better its somewhat unnecessary
4305862 recent hardware revisions of the xbox 360 hardware have largely eliminated the issues that cause the rrod and as a result the units are generally much more stable that makes this kind of mod overkill at best and a waste of money time and a warranty you may just wind up needing at worst unless youre playing in like a cramped german soup kitchen in downtown brazil at high noon in the middle of summer theres really no point to this
4305863 hey guys the other day i was rubbing my genitals on a farm tire out back and i got hit with the greatest idea for a t shirt
4305864 its a chance for the visitors to have a better time here
4305865 if they are going to the go crabbing and we hope they do dungeness crabs is a delicious meal and they should come here
4305866 who has man mans mouth or who makes him dumb or deaf or seeing or blind is it not i the lord exod 4 11 amazingly the lord not only accomodates moses condition he takes credit for it
4305867 god has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong the things that are not that he might nullify the things that are that no man should boast before god
4305868 i just lost one of my best friends at work and now i am going to be the only one stuck cleaning out the and in the face of this significant loss do i really care if we have the phone bill from january 2007 that isnt even in my name hmm no
4305869 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
4305870 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4305871 oh my god i cant wait to see this new
4305872 thats as a result of gold falling overnight and continuing to decline in the asian session today
4305873 it actually fell below the critical the us 800 an ounce level this morning
4305874 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4305875 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4305876 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4305877 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4305878 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4305879 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4305880 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4305881 we had this hard nosed feminist all women together thing and kurt russell was supposed to be a bastard and suddenly all these scenes were being rewritten and i found myself in a very awkward position because i had to cooperate with these new scenes
4305882 to see if hed be interested in putting a film together of the concert
4305883 he designed the lighting for the live show with a lighting director and found it very frustrating that he could never get the right lighting he realized that on film he would finally get the chance to get the lighting right
4305884 so we said were not crazy about split screen images and flashing images there was always one camera straight on the format was very flat it was always like a painting sort of like a robert wilson design in two dimensions but also with four moving cameras and even though there were cranes that would be observing things a lot of the time we werent even aware we were being filmed it comes across as being real
4305885 the whole staging of the show seemed to be the most obvious idea in the world to construct a show where you saw what it took to construct a show in the show and you start with an empty stage with absolutely nothing on it and you put the stuff on the stage during the show that it takes to make a show the lights the amps the instruments the players everything and then you proceed to use that stuff so everybody sees what it takes to make a show when they see that stuff put into action
4305886 theres been a kind of curse on concert movies they almost never do well commercially and im very rarely excited by them i wanted to eliminate two things that i dont like about them shots of the audience and backstage interviews with the singers
4305887 very quickly people started leaving their seats and moving up closer to the screen and also standing up in their seats by the end of burning down the house the building was literally shaking and the manager of the theater was truly sincerely freaked out he thought something terrible structurally might be about to happen and it was a big struggle with him to not stop the show
4305888 another thing i noticed was my character if i could call myself a character he takes a kind of journey in this thing he starts off as mister stiff white guy and does his very very very best to get down and get loose by the end of the show to kind of shed his inhibitions and get loose and so hes kind of changed as a person just like would happen in a regular movie with a regular story with three acts or whatever which i think helps make this movie work in a way that some other concert movies dont
4305889 no matter how hard i tried i never could develop much of an affinity for talking heads they are one of those acts that i always felt i should like but just never really did i think sms might finally have done it is it the greatest concert film of all time i dont feel that way i doubt anything will ever surpass princes brilliant sign o the times but this piece directed by jonathan demme makes a strong argument for the heads case the film presents the band cleanly effectively and evocatively it does what every good concert movie should do it makes me really wish i could see the show live
4305890 first let me say that the talking heads had a huge influence on me as a teenager they were among my favorite bands and one of the reasons that i wound up learning the bass and spending the next fifteen years playing in bands of my own though considered an avant garde art band the heads put on a surprisingly energetic presentation that shows them to be both consummate performers and accomplished musicians stop making sense comes closer to capturing the feel of a live show than any concert film made before or since if you let your self get swept up in the performance you may well be tempted to get up off the couch and dance around in front of your screen
4305891 there are a few times and places where the universe or god or the muse is caught on film talking to us through human conduits on my short list of such religious musical experiences are hendrix at
4305892 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4305893 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4305894 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4305895 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4305896 not long ago it was florida state and miami dominating college football where was the sec then
4305897 these things go in cycles the sec has had a nice run im sure that the acc or another conference will take its place
4305898 yes where was the sec back when miami and florida state were so good in the 90s

4305902 the heart warps everything around it where nothing is emptiness itself is twisted its features distorted beyond all recognition this is why people rail against the heart it is bad enough to change everything that is but when nothingness itself is altered something must be done
4305903 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites
4305904 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
4305905 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon
4305906 as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies
4305907 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
4305908 australian workers urgently need the rest of work choices to be scrapped and to have their rights to collectively bargain restored
4305909 we want to see peoples rights in the workplace respected and that includes of course if they have chosen to join a union having the union able to represent them
4305910 it is the same model we put on the table with unions during negotiations which aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
4305911 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
4305912 the government will pocket a 12 million windfall from everyone who buys and sells property
4305913 the government claims that works well in some areas but the auditor has pointed to problems
4305914 these imply the financial outcomes ie cost savings from the it transformation remain on track
4305915 the upgrade is a salient reminder of the age old telecoms equation growth in network volumes means capacity investment required
4305916 in telstras case it is comforting to see the company converting the strong data volumes into robust sales growth
4305917 the transformation spend may be indicative of some overspend delay in the transformation program while the increase in the business as usual capex is indicative of the aggressive capex sales expectations management had set
4305918 due to choppy market conditions and regulatory risks still on the horizon
4305919 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4305920 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4305921 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4305922 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4305923 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4305924 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways
4305925 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians
4305926 the robots biological brain is made up of cultured neurons which are placed onto a multi electrode array mea the mea is a dish with approximately 60 electrodes which pick up the electrical signals generated by the cells this is then used to drive the movement of the robot every time the robot nears an object signals are directed to stimulate the brain by means of the electrodes in response the brains output is used to drive the wheels of the robot left and right so that it moves around in an attempt to avoid hitting objects the robot has no additional control from a human or a computer its sole means of control is from its own brain
4305927 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
4305928 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4305929 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4305930 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4305931 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4305932 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4305933 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4305934 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4305935 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4305936 i dont think any of them are really gonna represent me
4305937 fuck it if this falls short of revolutionary so be it
4305938 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4305939 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4305940 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4305941 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4305942 it was painted as a real family event too and no one seems to have realised its wrong
4305943 they have lost the plot and it is an absolute disgrace the victim has already been through enough without having these clowns organising a fundraising day
4305944 our trial was not powered on a difference in clinical outcome between the two groups however we noted a better clinical outcome in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group with lower overall mortality and less urgent repeat primary coronary angioplasty
4305945 reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the need for fast and strong platelet inhibition it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organized hospital systems have been able to provide such a service
4305946 perhaps this could offend some people not just people of color
4305947 we are looking for the next level up in singers and you all are not it you do help make the show though you just arent what we are looking for thanks anyway
4305948 the obama nation leftist politics and the illinois senator is a dangerous radical candidate for president the book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against obama that he was raised a muslim attended a radical black rage
4305949 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4305950 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4305951 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide

4305960 well she has a pin hole in her ear drum

4305962 if we were tied 1 1 before the vote now we have returned to a tie but a 3 3 tie what use will these actors get from their victories

4305966 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
4305967 get your backside in gear before i get to three
4305968 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4305969 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4305970 it is a heterogeneous cabinet it awaits to be seen whether it will manage to work together effectively as a team
4305971 lugo is going to keep his feet firmly planted on the ground
4305972 he has to put top priority on governability and avoid ideological conflicts in order to really tackle the countrys crucial problems
4305973 the evidence leads us to believe that the spending of the ministries budget funds is aimed at emptying out the coffers of certain key institutions in order to deprive the government that will take office on aug 15 of a minimum level of funds needed for the actions it plans to carry out
4305974 i would be satisfied if the new government fulfills the three basic points it promised in the campaign
4305975 the trojans are hoping for similar luck with what carroll delicately referred to as chafing
4305976 weve had to adjust to some new equipment that were wearing that didnt work out right

4305979 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license

4305990 when the computer was first built its inventors did not have telephony in mind nor was it even on the horizon

4306002 i was told by my adoptive parents that i joined them as a family member as an infant and my biological dad was different and not like the rest of us those remarks often caused me to fantasise and wonder about just me who my birth dad really was a monster a member of the traveling circus
4306003 it was like meeting myself 30 years ago hes got a different talent but same drive and passion and certainly the same sense of humor

4306045 hello world this is my world welcome it is a world full of enjoyment in exhaustible
4306046 you would look so much better if youd cut your hair
4306047 im trying to set an example to black people that we dont have to conform
4306048 but cant you do it and look nice like everybody else at the same time
4306049 chairman angelo massone has told me motherwell have put in a bid the spl is where i want to play so id be keen to join
4306050 they play excellent football are in the uefa cup and were third in the league last season so it would be a great move
4306051 im pleased that weve got steve bruce that was the best bit of business that i ever did and i probably ever will do in football
4306052 i paid 3million for him and hes paid me back so many times already hes done a fantastic job hes got his team together hes happy with his team weve signed the players that he wanted
4306053 hes over the moon with the squad hes got and we cant wait to get going
4306054 its always difficult to win the premier league its a hard slog and youve got to produce consistent performances and results and weve proven we can do it over a number of seasons
4306055 this season it will be as difficult as ever the teams at the top will be challenging very hard
4306056 weve obviously got to maintain our levels of consistency that weve had in the previous two seasons if we do that then weve got a great chance
4306057 we dont fear anybody but i think that arsenal chelsea and liverpool are all capable of winning the league
4306058 theyve got good enough players and sometimes its just down to a little bit of luck last minute goals injuries these are things that are not in your control
4306059 his name has never even been mentioned in the eight months i have been at this club
4306060 he captained the best team in england manchester united over the last 10 or 15 years so he has a presence about him which goes through the squad we want to do well for him
4306061 we have to keep progressing and moving forward its certainly the right appointment
4306062 we just missed out on europe last season so it has to be our aim to get back in there were looking to push on and get back in there
4306063 the biggest thing about my last four managers graeme souness steve bruce mark hughes and paul ince is that theyve all been successful as players
4306064 they are no different as managers they are very ambitious have a good work ethic and want to get results
4306065 it is nothing to panic about we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4306066 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4306067 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4306068 im very disappointed at birmingham that they are pursuing this
4306069 we advertised for staff they applied for the job we interviewed them they gave their necessary notice in
4306070 weve not taken anyone from birmingham who didnt want to leave im just disappointed at birmingham for saying weve been poached their staff
4306071 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4306072 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4306073 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4306074 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4306075 there were a couple of scares by them and a good goal by them but we won convincingly in the end we are obviously in a very strong position for the second leg
4306076 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4306077 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4306078 the most encouraging thing is they wanted to carry on with the game every single time there was a free kick they went to play it quickly
4306079 it is very easy to sit here and be full of praise for the opponents if you have won if you think you have done okay but their spirit was commendable
4306080 they would have been disappointed to concede a goal so early
4306081 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4306082 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4306083 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4306084 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4306085 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4306086 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4306087 we had to go or there would have been shooting

4306120 you have no idea what its like to be dealing with a man having a heart attack only to have a nurse rush in and tell you that someone is coding in a nearby room
4306121 i had to look at that man and say you are having a heart attack but you are okay right now i have a more serious case in the next room and ill be right back thats happened to me and its very frustrating

4306127 if you pull all the paying customers out of the ers and leave only the poor the uninsured and the most severely ill and injured youll see hospitals come under even greater financial pressure in terms of operating their ers than ever before

4306130 for the past 30 years the message of the disability rights movement has been as consistent as it is simple were fine as we are we dont need fixing we need access we need respect we need work in other words we need the same things everybody else does
4306131 we believe that disability is a natural part of life its part of who we are cures if they come will be in the future we can cure prejudice and discrimination the real killer diseases right now
4306132 we are mindful that in the process of assuring quality we also act responsibly not to harm the environment this is why we do not sell any parts of animals that are classified under the endangered species and are in full support of the initiative by acres and stoc

4306140 i think the message from campaigns about climate change and the environmental impact of our actions is getting out there
4306141 maybe their products dont have as big a presence as the big companies but as a group they offer a greener choice and variety for consumers
4306142 its important to have that so that consumers can choose
4306143 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4306144 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4306145 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4306146 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4306147 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4306148 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4306149 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans
4306150 even if all countries stop deforestation tomorrow and then within 100 years global warming changes 4 5 degrees further then forget it the tipping point will have been reached

4306153 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4306154 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4306155 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4306156 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4306157 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4306158 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4306159 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4306160 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4306161 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4306162 now rank with overfishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as major global environmental problems
4306163 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine eco systems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4306164 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4306165 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4306166 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4306167 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4306168 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4306169 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved
4306170 rank with over fishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as global environmental problems
4306171 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4306172 to keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4306173 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4306174 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4306175 there have been mass mortalities that have wiped out local populations example of fisheries species mortalities that have had economic consequences
4306176 em 360 para que voc possa fazer bons neg cios
4306177 dead zones were once rare but now theyre commonplace and there are more of them in more places
4306178 but things can change and theres no guarantee that we wont be seeing blooms of algae in the future here too so we need to be really vigilant
4306179 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4306180 the conclusion is inescapable that dead zones are now a key stressor in coastal waters
4306181 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4306182 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4306183 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent
4306184 i am now looking for any team that will give me an opportunity to contribute wherever i am needed
4306185 they have to make sure they stay in shape and they need to be patient
4306186 they can help a team somewhere sometime but the need may not be there right now
4306187 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalogue
4306188 when i consider the pressure expectations and the attention that surrounded me at the time i honestly feel quite unwell
4306189 im so glad i didnt realise the intense public and media interest surrounding me back then as i fear i may have buckled under the massive weight if i had been aware
4306190 they all expect him to get a gold medal thats huge pressure on him
4306191 liu has had intensive training these days to compensate for what he lost due to the shortage of competitions before the olympics
4306192 his injuries have been cured and no longer affect his normal training
4306193 i dont know what makes me so fast and successful
4306194 i know when i see a hurdle in front of me i just attack it
4306195 the races he loses he always hits that last hurdle when he clears it its over
4306196 i always said he was the best 110 hurdler in the world ever since i saw him first run in 2006
4306197 hes got the size 6 3 seven steps to the first hurdle then his lead leg is superfast and active he keeps his trail leg tight
4306198 i feel like im learning from everyday life i feel like im my best therapist
4306199 you always hope to win a championship in anything you do ive been playing sports a long time and through high school and college i never won a championship never won a state championship never won an sec championship never won a national championship
4306200 so to finally do it at the professional level the highest level is a great accomplishment its been a long wait but every year you dont get one it makes you want it more
4306201 i didnt know what i was getting into i was pretty naive if i knew the new york media was like this i might have had a different idea
4306202 but ive never had any doubts or questioned my decisions about that even the tough times i never blamed the media for anything
4306203 i knew i had to play better football i didnt think i was playing great football and they were giving me a bad rap
4306204 i wasnt playing well i knew i wanted to play better i was trying to prove to myself and my teammates that i could play at a high level
4306205 he is a stand up guy if something goes wrong hes going to admit to it and he is going to come back and try harder the next week you are never going to see him hanging his head you are never going to see him giving up
4306206 elis had a lot of good games but theres the yo yo thing there and what youre looking for from that position is consistency
4306207 he made the plays when he had to make them
4306208 hes just becoming more and more aware of what it means to be a quarterback in this league and to have control in all of these situations and know exactly what he wants to do and his teammates have such great belief in him
4306209 he got on a roll and he got confidence once you start winning those close games and your team starts seeing that in you the skys the limit
4306210 you can make some things happen that you didnt know you could make happen
4306211 i think that the changing of the guard was coming last year regardless of certain people still being here or not
4306212 he was the super bowl mvp so this is definitely his team you get the opportunity being around him a lot to see how he looks more comfortable and hes realizing that now
4306213 we dont all get together all that often so it was kind of like old times
4306214 we were going to play golf and watch caddyshack on the portable dvd player
4306215 i dont feel differently maybe someone from the outside could say something different but i dont feel ive changed
4306216 im still a humble person i still look forward to practice i still get upset when we have bad plays i still prepare the same way from a football standpoint im doing things the same and preparing to get better
4306217 i dont think a quarterback reaches his full potential until his sixth or seventh year elis going into his fifth year
4306218 this guy can get better and he wants to get better and he works on things he has to get better at
4306219 no one can take it away but it isnt like youre finished that youve done everything you can do it was fun
4306220 you want to relive that experience and have that journey again i think we have a lot more to prove i have a lot more to prove
4306221 tortura do lado de fora da vila ol mpica um guia para os campos de trabalho da china

4306225 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play
4306226 i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires
4306227 its over with he made his mistake apologized and we moved on
4306228 theres nothing to be said he knew he messed up he recognized it right away weve moved on already
4306229 he felt remorse enough that five minutes after it happened he apologized its not something to harp on
4306230 it didnt cost us the win and if it did cost us the win it didnt cost us the season he thought he hit the ball out of the park it didnt go out of the park and he ended up at first base sori works as hard as anybody else on this team if not harder
4306231 hes one of the best in the game for a superstar to act the way he acts and work as hard as he does its very refreshing
4306232 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4306233 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4306234 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4306235 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4306236 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4306237 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4306238 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4306239 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4306240 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4306241 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4306242 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4306243 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4306244 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4306245 its going to be tough because at the moment the level is high
4306246 we have to improve our whole package to be fast at every track its only a month since the operation on his hand but i hope it can be better and better because sometimes you can feel pain for longer when you are pushing so hard
4306247 this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win the usgp and with our bike and tyres working very well
4306248 i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again
4306249 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4306250 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4306251 it would be nice if i can put pressure on right up until the last lap
4306252 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
4306253 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
4306254 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
4306255 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
4306256 the numerous whales maintained a very productive ecosystem as environmental gardeners it collapsed with their decimation
4306257 the actual employees can shoot these animals in lieu of wages
4306258 with the economic meltdown these guys are getting paid about seven us dollars a month way below the poverty line they shoot the animals and sell the meat to the locals
4306259 the people have to survive theres no food in the market so what are they going to do they are going to shoot the animals that you can understand but this is something else where is it theres a market somewhere and somebodys buying all the stuff
4306260 it is heartbreaking that the wildlife is paying the biggest price of all in the economic collapse of this country
4306261 elephant numbers appear to be stable or currently slightly increasing in zimbabwe at the moment
4306262 we have never had any reason to think they have something to hide
4306263 its clearly a country thats under a lot of pressure from a variety of directions im sure they are up against it in places given the socio economic problems there it would be astonishing if there wasnt poaching taking place
4306264 the poaching of elephants is just as much motivated by a desire to acquire the meat as it is to acquire ivory
4306265 its certainly true that zimbabwe every year kills a large number of elephants as part of problem animal control but i wouldnt have thought it was 1 800
4306266 if zimbabwe has decided to engage in culling to control its stocks thats a matter for zimbabwe they are completely entitled to do that
4306267 hemos discutido asuntos de fundamental importancia para la situaci n de los trabajadores del sector educativo en venezuela por ejemplo acordamos realizar trabajo voluntario los trabajadores vamos a organizarnos en brigadas para trabajar en horas no laborables en vacaciones para apoyar a las misiones del gobierno nacional y cualquier actividad que haga falta como trabajo voluntario en venezuela
4306268 aprobamos un sistema de carreras que va a ser planteado por el ministerio a la asamblea nacional que va a sustituir los valores de cargos y tabuladores de las universidades con un concepto de transformaci n universitaria queremos que la universidad salga de sus recintos e interact e realmente con la comunidad a la que se debe
4306269 lo que no dicen los que impugna mi candidatura es que la ley org nica del poder p blico municipal establece claramente en su art culo 29 que para el tema de los distritos metropolitanos hay una ley especial que rige cuales son los requisitos para ser electo alcalde mayor o alcalde
4306270 se requiere ser venezolano mayor de 21 a os de edad de estado seglar no estar sometido a condena mediante sentencia definitivamente firme residencia de no menos de 5 a os en el rea del distrito metropolitano de caracas
4306271 estoy seguro que no hay ning n problema con la candidatura es simplemente parte de este juego que a veces en lugar de ir a las propuestas se va por este tipo de mecanismos que utilizan los candidatos de la oposici n
4306272 dif cilmente tu vas hoy por la autopista francisco fajardo y sabes cuando entras al municipio libertador cuando sales a chacao o cuando entras a chacao y sales a sucre ese comportamiento de metr polis te lleva a que la vida en ese gran distrito se entrelace y tu no sabes donde termina uno y comienza la otro
4306273 estoy seguro que esa medida no tendr ning n tipo de impacto porque la ley es clara y establece cual es el mecanismo y dentro de ese mecanismo nosotros hemos inscrito nuestra candidatura
4306274 es en esta v a donde transita en hora pico el mayor n mero de personas por minutos en am rica latina
4306275 you can say what you think but you will live what you believe
4306276 ladies and gentleman for anyone with an open seat between them me among others we have a young mother and her infant child that need 2 seats together would anyone be willing to accommodate them
4306277 not sufficient admissible evidence to support a conviction proving the identity of the driver beyond a reasonable doubt
4306278 its the highest burden in the law proving beyond a reasonable doubt we can only base our decision on admissible evidence
4306279 we just didnt have sufficient admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt criminal liability
4306280 and the law is clear that you have to have corroboration of accomplice testimony
4306281 we didnt have that were ethically barred from filing a case unless we have sufficient corroborating evidence
4306282 i dont see how the da can convict me of racing when it takes two to tango
4306283 how can i get convicted of racing and they get let go free the same witnesses said i was racing and they were racing whered they go
4306284 i f ing killed them i know theyre f ing dead
4306285 probably because of the earlier crashes its still backed up out there
4306286 but all of us agree the crop is down and appears to be getting lighter as we get closer to harvest
4306287 the restav k practice essentially throws away the lives of children and along with them haitis future
4306288 the practice of lending a child away to go and live with well off families
4306289 if a person thus chooses to love another of the same sex or opposite and that person loves back why shouldnt they be allowed to formalize their relationship is love so frightening

4306298 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times it is a crow are you not able to understand this
4306299 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
4306300 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today

4306346 it didn t seem like we were getting very far
4306347 it is hard to play safe out here and if you do that you are going to give yourself some tough putts and you will start aiming shots and not hitting fairways
4306348 being aggressive has always been my game plan and yesterday i got away from that i will not do that anymore this week

4306350 my ball striking was definitely better of the tee yesterday and it has to be for the rest of the week for me to win this championship
4306351 i have to keep giving myself chances but it all comes down to putting
4306352 i have to be more aggressive then i was today i played it a bit too safe out there
4306353 i struggled on the putting on the back nine but overall i hit the ball pretty well
4306354 i am playing solid golf and that is what i have to do to win this week

4306381 that curriculum does matter and some curricula can produce better learning outcomes for children than others
4306382 why dont we just train the teachers on how to teach kids to read and then let them use students interests and experiences to teach

4306389 afl forwards are developing into a taller athletic mould and it has made it increasingly tough for a player of mals playing style which has seen him dominate the backline for a long period of time
4306390 the club wishes him luck with life beyond football and thanks him for providing a great defensive combination with dustin fletcher and fast tracking the development of patrick ryder
4306391 not just wicked no i never even managed to become anything neither wicked nor good
4306392 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4306393 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4306394 either ridge or sen joe lieberman would be a transformative vp pick who could help open up the republican party and deliver moderate voters and independents some mccain advisers believe mccain is seriously weighing that option sources say
4306395 but its a tough calculus a pro choice nominee would infuriate the anti abortion element of the conservative base and potentially be a bitter divorce from the religious right
4306396 in opening up the possibility of choosing a pro choice nominee just a few weeks or even days before he is expected to make his vice presidential pick public mccain is likely testing the waters to see how such a move would be received by the base voters who have long been skeptical about his conservative bona fides
4306397 if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4306398 naming mr ridge also could raise the thorny issue of immigration because by some measures immigration enforcement dropped under mr ridges tenure only to pick up when his successor michael chertoff took office
4306399 the democratic party is planning a convention designed to soften the edges on the partys support for abortion rights with a revamped platform and a speaking lineup that reinforces efforts to broaden democrats appeal on the hot button issue
4306400 with less than two weeks to go before the start of the presidential nominating conventions barack obamas lead over john mccain has disappeared
4306401 mccain is garnering more support from his base including republicans and white evangelical protestants than he was in june and he also has steadily gained backing from white working class voters over this period
4306402 ignoring the warnings that social security can derail political careers senator john mccain has infuriated his partys right wing by saying that everything has to be on the table in discussions about keeping social security solvent
4306403 in the space of one week he opened the door to an increase in social security taxes denied he would raise payroll taxes and then through an ally called a tax increase a dumb idea
4306404 he has also sowed confusion about whether he favors privatizing social security or continuing with the current system
4306405 like president bush mccain wants to privatize our social security
4306406 combined with saturdays round obama has spent close to 12 hours on the links while in hawaii
4306407 it was all part of a continuing effort by the mccain campaign to seize on the events overseas to appear presidential and in command on the world stage while at the same time not appearing to be political
4306408 it ends up i believe helping in the short run john mccain he has been somewhat prescient on this issue barack obama is playing it a little more safe
4306409 the world has learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked a cease fire that holds is a vital first step but only one with our allies we now must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to end violence permanently and withdraw its troops from georgia international monitors must gain immediate access to war torn areas in order to avert an even greater humanitarian disaster and we should ensure that emergency aid lifted by air and sea is delivered
4306410 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere russia intends to destroy not just a country but an idea
4306411 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4306412 they did not reveal what the so called list was about
4306413 latest antics show that the regime is not sincere on the dialogue process the detention is an affront to sadc to the au and to the broader international community who are working hard to peacefully resolve zimbabwes crisis
4306414 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4306415 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals
4306416 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4306417 i had a really close look and didnt recognise any buildings that i know from birmingham so i thought theres just something wrong here
4306418 im a regular visitor to the us and i thought maybe it looked a little bit like a us city i thought well actually theres a birmingham in america
4306419 so i got on to google and found a picture of the downtown area of birmingham alabama and hey presto there it was
4306420 birmingham is immensely proud of its recycling record and this leaflet has helped to get the recycling message across to thousands of our enthusiastic citizens over the last 15 months
4306421 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message
4306422 people have a tendency as you well know to get all bent out of shape over stuff

4306430 he did not make any obvious preparations to leave and left on foot without taking his mobile phone
4306431 we would anyone who thinks they have seen him to get in touch
4306432 he knew perfectly well that were he to draw the matter to the attention of the authorities no doubt steps would have been taken because of the presence of the girl in the house to terminate the situation
4306433 he should have explained he was a sex offender he should have told the mother of the child and he should have told the police where he was
4306434 i bet you didnt know that i have struggled with my eye sight for years it started in high school when it became difficult for me to see the chalkboard in class i never wanted to wear contacts or glasses so i have just kind of dealt with it i got glasses but never wore them i am getting lasik eye surgery soon and im sooo scared
4306435 kita tekah melaksanakan reformasi secara menyeluruh di berbagai sektor kita pun sudah berhasil menjalani masa transisi demokrasi sehingga indonesia dikenal sebagai negara demokrasi ketiga terbesar di dunia
4306436 apalagi indonesia dinilai berhasil memperkokoh integritas nkri mulai dari aceh yang damai papua yang stabil hingga sampit yang tenteram
4306437 semua ini bukan prestasi individu atau kelompok namun prestasi dan kerja keras seluruh bangsa indonesia
4306438 masalah keamanan harus menjadi perhatian terutama di papuas kita tahu menjelang hut opm kan tapi saya kira ini masalah yang harus dilihat dari sisi luar negeri apalagi kongres as mengirimkan surat soal opm itu harus ada pernyataan sikap yang tegas dari presiden tahun lalu bicara aceh tahun ini harusnya bicara papua papua juga butuh perhatian
4306439 dan yang penting apakah ada kenaikan bbm atau tidak di tahun 2009 presiden harus memberikan sinyal yang jelas
4306440 presiden sudah menunjukkan itu dengan menyatakan akan mempertahankan pemerintahan ini untuk menjaga stabilitas politik selain itu akan banyak juga hal hal yang berkaitan dengan ekonomi dan akan menimbulkan gejolak misalnya dalam waktu dekat puasa lebaran natal tahun baru dan lain lain pemerintah harus menjelaskan apa yang akan dilakukan untuk menjaga kestabilan kondisi

4306446 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4306447 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4306448 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her

4306457 the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities
4306458 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
4306459 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
4306460 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
4306461 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
4306462 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
4306463 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
4306464 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvellous marvellous engraver

4306536 it lifts your heart to hear these children playing and having so much fun after such a sad start in life their mother is a miracle worker
4306537 can you imagine if we could reduce the 700 billion say by thirty percent thats 200 billion 200 billion that stays home it doesnt go out the back door 200 billion creates a lot of jobs people make profits off of that taxes are paid and the economy moves forward

4306545 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4306546 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4306547 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4306548 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4306549 thats as a result of gold falling overnight and continuing to decline in the asian session today
4306550 it actually fell below the critical the us 800 an ounce level this morning
4306551 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4306552 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4306553 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools
4306554 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
4306555 football and basketball are both team sports but theres something about football and being out here
4306556 youre going through summer camp youre outside and theres just something different about it plus theres a lot more aggression its just fun and i missed it
4306557 we were kind of shocked at first but we were pleasantly surprised
4306558 hes an athletic kid though he was a little rusty last year because he hadnt played football in a long time but hes come into his own right now
4306559 i know some of the guys had hard feelings about it and i kind of felt bad about it too
4306560 but sometimes you have to live your own life and there are things you have to do sometimes it hurt a lot to make that decision
4306561 especially football you cant be away from it for a year or two and it all comes back you may be in good shape but you may not be in football shape youre getting used to contact youre learning how to tackle properly plus being in football shape
4306562 you pick up the system and play hard and you can play here
4306563 i hadnt swung a bat in three or four years
4306564 i think itd be tougher for someone to go back to football after a long absence because of all the terminology
4306565 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4306566 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4306567 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4306568 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why
4306569 that im of no further use to my country is why im considering australia that my former parliamentary colleagues seem not to want to appoint me to anything but are quite happy to accommodate others who have left or are about to so as to shut them up from whingeing from the sidelines in election year
4306570 politics was never my ambition i was coaxed into it by others
4306571 i always wanted to achieve in the entertainment industry that i succeeded in politics was as much a surprise to me as anyone
4306572 im too tarnished as a former transsexual politician to be taken any more seriously in entertainment than dancing with the stars
4306573 it seems that i am not valued for my experience in either local or central government so i guess i wasted 14 years of my life in publicly elected service and ended up unemployable
4306574 our job is to push these kids to their limits so they can perform gloriously for our nation

4306578 sending them to put out a fire in the wilderness is both overkill and unnecessary
4306579 firefighters are being ordered to take significant risks of their lives health and safety that are incommensurate with the benefits of suppression

4306591 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4306592 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4306593 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4306594 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4306595 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4306599 the anti war movement views iraqi civilians deaths as grist for the anti american mill dead sudanese are a statistic dead iraqis before the war are a vague memory dead civilians in iraq today are an exhilarating opportunity for the socialist left to undermine american liberty power and society this fuzzy math cannot stand logic times will keep from this day forward the iraq survival count

4306609 for political stability i urge all to adopt a reconciliatory rather than confrontational approach
4306610 political forces joined hands together so that all doors for the return of dictatorship are closed provinces get full autonomy and people are made the real source of power
4306611 its not in the interest of the chief of the army staff or the military as an institution to let the former chief of army staff be impeached by parliament
4306612 may say he will go on his own by the end of year

4306614 for me playing in this match would be special and if i can score that will also be nice but only if we win
4306615 i know a lot of people from my time at hearts and enjoyed playing football there i had a good relationship with the fans and also managed to score quite a lot of goals some against celtic and rangers
4306616 but this is now in the past and all i want to do is score goals for rangers and help us win games i want to show our great fans what i am capable of so all i can do is work as hard as i can in training and hope i am selected for matches
4306617 like every player i want to be involved all the time but we have a lot of forwards at the club right now and it is up to the manager what he decides to do i was very happy to score my first goal at falkirk last saturday but the main thing was to get three points and make a good start to the season
4306618 fuelling and financing drug syndicates after the afp seized 662 kilograms of pseudoephedrine worth 52 8 million
4306619 the last five weeks has seen law enforcement in australia at its most effective in dealing with the threat of drugs mr carmody said
4306620 it would appear our market here in australia is prepared to pay a premium for this sort of narcotic he said
4306621 it lifts your heart to hear these children playing and having so much fun after such a sad start in life their mother is a miracle worker

4306630 within the past week clinton advisers informed the obama team that many of clintons staunchest supporters felt strongly that something had to be done and that clinton had concluded that in part for the sake of unity their wishes ought to be respected they heard back immediately the obama campaign had always been open to having her name placed in nomination alongside his
4306631 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4306632 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4306633 the piece contains some good information regarding cpm rates at the online ad supported music services the author points out the dilemma well known to those in the field that these rates are quite low ad supported music will not escape the low ceiling of online display advertising cpms until it moves from streaming to downloaded tracks
4306634 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed excellent hands and hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard
4306635 we simply cannot allow this sort of brazen and inconsiderate defiance of state code
4306636 but nobody in the office was willing to deliver the notice while the mountain was still erupting
4306637 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4306638 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4306639 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4306640 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4306641 the capacity to have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something or the effect itself
4306642 anybody whos been in the club business knows you have to be willing to do just about anything to make money
4306643 it might not be a great fit but its better than being closed for four days
4306644 if you just look at the timing of it were lucky to be getting the republican convention instead of the democratic
4306645 what is normally one of the slowest weeks of the year will probably now be one of the busiest weeks of all time for many of us
4306646 as soon as they announced where the rnc is going to be i was probably on the phone with first avenue 30 seconds later
4306647 im interested in real deal venues like first avenue instead of some cheesy hotel ballroom somewhere and so are plenty of republicans you wait and see
4306648 theres going to be so much traffic and congestion none of our regular customers wouldve wanted to come to shows and no touring bands couldve found hotel rooms
4306649 twin cities music fans have to have somewhere to hide out with all those republicans freely roaming our streets
4306650 a lot of clubs are hurting right now because of the economy and so are restaurants and a lot of other businesses in downtown minneapolis
4306651 some places will probably make more money over five days than they have all year
4306652 hope for homeowners act of 2008 creates a new temporary voluntary program within fha to back fha insured mortgages to borrowers at fisk of foreclosure
4306653 if youre looking for 300 30 home runs and 100 rbis then i look pretty awful right now i aint the only 220 hitter in this game i aint the last one to hit 220 but its never a big deal when a lot of guys that play everyday hit in the same spot everyday and hit 220 and nobody says a thing
4306654 when the organization tells you that youre fine i cant say im not fine i have to be on the same page as the organization thats just the way it goes
4306655 i talked to my trainer and he said basically what im doing is unrealistic
4306656 he has power on base skills and dont forget that hes a 60 on the 20 to 80 scouting scale runner as well his defense is adequate but i think hes the kind of guy who is an everyday corner outfielder on a first division team he could be pretty special

4306665 computer scientists have developed a program called recaptcha which is being used in lieu of captcha by several sites to help digitize old books and newspapers the recaptcha takes entries from old and faded texts that optical scanners and digital text readers have trouble with so every time you solve that string of crooked letters you may actually be helping historians digitally reconstruct a page from the 1908 new york times
4306666 the bbc is reporting that carnegie mellon university has found a

4306668 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4306669 it was painted as a real family event too and no one seems to have realised its wrong
4306670 they have lost the plot and it is an absolute disgrace the victim has already been through enough without having these clowns organising a fundraising day
4306671 we are glad to be working with astro i believe the coverage will give the desaru pengerang triathlon the exposure we want
4306672 my bowlers are physically and mentally charged up for the event i have also drilled them on all possible oil patterns applied to the lanes at the venue sf strike bowl ngamwongwan in order for them to strike the right chord
4306673 my target is the team event my charges have collectively recorded a 200 plus pin average on the oiling patterns and its a par score good enough to pose a strong challenge in the team event
4306674 its going to be tough considering that professional bowlers will be competing in the world meet for the first time
4306675 however its not an excuse for the bowlers to end up without medals as i have covered everything with them and now its up to them
4306676 the current squad are probably slightly short of world meet experience as compared to the 2006 squad but they are a solid team
4306677 they proved their mettle by winning the team gold medal at the recent asian meet in hong kong
4306678 it means a lot to us because its the last olympics for baseball
4306679 if we win it will go down in history i think we will put up a good fight
4306680 the rudd labor government firmly believes that there is every reason to be optimistic about the future of the nations automotive industry if the right policy decisions are made now this is what this review is all about
4306681 the automotive industry is strategically critical to australia in terms of exports employment and innovation our economy benefits from the investment jobs skills research and development innovation and the exports the industry generates
4306682 the review has come at an urgent time for the australian automotive industry federation chief executive anna greco said in a statement
4306683 now is the time to commit to changes in the way we handle automotive policy so that we can create a more successful and sustainable industry
4306684 central to this needs to be a vision to produce one million cars here by 2020 mainly for export and to secure reciprocal obligations that deliver genuine opportunities for local sourcing
4306685 the australian industry most definitely has a future the future is one which is internationally competitive more globally integrated and greener it is essential that we develop considered and long term policy settings designed to encourage a more world competitive and environmentally sustainable industry
4306686 all of these things are coming together in a confluence of events thats creating tremendous pressure on the industry
4306687 thats why i think its very important for the australian government to respond in kind and respond favourably to support the domestic industry
4306688 there appears to be no end of the candidate market in sight with skills acquisition and retention still a pressing concern for it directors
4306689 rates for contractors tend to be much more volatile than salaries for staff and are prone to falling during a slowdown
4306690 during the last downturn we had reports of rates for contractors being slashed by major banks but more than four times as many it directors think rates will rise than fall which shows that skills shortages are still very much an issue

4306693 gremlins the mischief makers of the air are believed to have originated in the middle east where long before the war they made themselves something of a pest to many pilots especially those of flying boats they were reported on wingtips on floats on propellers and in the aircraft one particularly virulent species of gremlin apparently living in the clouds had a habit of entering aircraft in bad visibility when the pilot had been flying for some time in cloud without being able to catch a glimpse of the ground the gremlin would skip on to his shoulder and whisper in his ear you silly upside down of course the pilot wasnt but it unnerved him and made him jumpy
4306694 it is believed that the gremlin found in the neighbourhood of the rock is generally speaking of the hairy footed variety with extremely large rudimentary ears fastened to the head in the case of the male by a peculiar scaffolding of gristle about eight feet long the abdomen is pierced with triangular holes through which the wind whistles when in flight
4306695 the creatures observed in the gibraltar area can scarcely be called true gremlins they are probably to be regarded as belonging to a distantly related species peculiar to the warmer conditions obtaining in the mediterranean zone
4306696 it is a potent hybrid of the most powerful political tools of authoritarianism communism central planning merciless repression constant surveillance harnessed to advance the goals of global capitalism
4306697 i heart china serves as the beijing regimes succinct public response to foreign criticism of chinas human rights record if our people love our country then you meddlers from outside ought to just shut up
4306698 in chinas olympic moment foreign critics are focusing on all the country has failed to achieve from its abundant air pollution to scant human rights chinas citizens on the other hand see all that the country has accomplished after emerging from foreign domination and internal turmoil they are proud of those achievements and resentful of foreigners pointing out chinas shortcomings especially when those failings dont bother the alleged victims
4306699 china has a long tradition of people trying to fit into the group moderating their behaviour to avoid standing out conspicuously a culture reinforced by the man made collectivism of the past half century
4306700 blogs have leapfrogged this tradition acting as a catalyst to encourage young people to become more individual so this and other grassroots media are now emerging strongly to challenge chinas social legacy
4306701 we want to make clear that if you commit a crime all bets are off
4306702 we dont want to create a class of victims and witnesses that can be preyed upon because of a fear of calling police

4306715 it really depends on whats going on with the person and whether or not theyre having severe symptoms
4306716 if theyre not showing severe symptoms we may just start them with natural items people will come in on the medications and well add the nutritional supplements in and sometimes theyll get off the acid blockers altogether
4306717 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well a lot of times when other things havent worked people find apple cider vinegar does and it can be taken indefinitely

4306755 you will see projects throughout our county each year but theyre not the substantial projects that need to be done for true congestion relief
4306756 there are traffic congestion hot spots all over the county
4306757 just widening the roads it definitely helps it eases the pain a little bit and thats what we want to make an effort for the entire county
4306758 the improvements that you see on 52 should be the entire length of 52 all the way through helena to the other side of shades crest road

4306765 these storms rolled off the mountains north and east of the valley
4306766 rainfall amounts from half an inch to an inch in less than an hours time fell near the lake pleasant area with nearly 2 inches near lake roosevelt in the salt river area
4306767 this pattern is typical of a monsoon evening thunderstorm in the valley garry said
4306768 the only thing lacking was more storms from the south consequently rainfall amounts wouldnt be as widespread or heavy as they were last thursday

4306772 they are a great partner who shares our commitment to quality and innovation while respecting our independence as a studio which is very empowering
4306773 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
4306774 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4306775 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
4306776 this camera is in very condition working and cosmetic condition
4306777 it is good to rub and polish our brain against that of others
4306778 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4306779 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4306780 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4306781 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4306782 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing
4306783 a typical american employee demands a high salary good benefits a good work environment vacation time and other job related perks such as reimbursement for higher education these job related perks are expensive and may not be cost effective for the business entity a business entity is forced to commit significant resources to employ an american work force and may often find that the demands of american employees far exceed the allotted budget
4306784 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4306785 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it

4306792 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancer than all the other gene mutations discovered so far the reasonable expectation is that this will save some lives
4306793 if confirmed in larger studies this finding brings us another step closer towards unravelling the inherited risk of bowel cancer
4306794 licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies
4306795 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4306796 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
4306797 new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce
4306798 i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research
4306799 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering
4306800 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among pre school children
4306801 the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4306802 there may well be some other common factor in obesity
4306803 in terms of tonsillectomies these are frequently given to children with breathing problems such as sleep apnoea which is certainly linked to being overweight in adults and may be linked to weight in children
4306804 it is possible for there to be a link between otitis externa a different form of ear infection and obesity because of the connection between obesity and type ii diabetes which can contribute to this condition
4306805 i cant even describe it i cant tell the doctor exactly where it is but i feel it
4306806 he didnt say anything about pain but its freedom he doesnt have
4306807 he really hasnt been that ace guy its been one thing or another hes still a young man but he hasnt been able to go to the post with all the equipment
4306808 i just need rest i had this in 2006 its just fatigue im eligible to come off the 24th and ill be more than ready to go

4306810 unsupervised use of sildenafil by patients with pre existing heart disease can result in serious side effects such as sudden cardiac death heart attack chest pain and stroke
4306811 sildenafil should not be used by individuals taking any type of nitrate drug due to the risk of developing potentially life threatening low blood pressure
4306812 anyone who has this product is advised not to use it and to consult their medical practitioner if they have any health concerns related to its use
4306813 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4306814 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4306815 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4306816 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4306817 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4306818 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4306819 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4306820 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4306821 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4306822 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4306823 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4306824 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4306825 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4306826 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4306827 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4306828 we all feel confident this is the strongest album weve made
4306829 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4306830 a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4306831 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4306832 you were working to take care of shit and my selfish spoiled delusional ass went and fucked someone else because i was bored since i dont have a fucking job other than spending the money that you make from working so much
4306833 well we have a great product anyway and i gave it a shot oh well lets keep pluggin along
4306834 market conditions continue to be extremely difficult and timberwest is therefore staying the course with its harvest deferral strategy
4306835 implementing policies aimed to rewrite school textbooks throughout the european continent in order to provide a positive and non threatening view of islam
4306836 to call anyone who tries to help them child brides forced into marriage islamopohobic is an obscene betrayal of these young women
4306837 all i want now is to finish my education i want to be a lawyer i want to defend oppressed people i want to be an example for all the other girls
4306838 they kept whispering in my ear to ask why i wasnt smiling i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married i pleaded with them to help me escape but no one saw anything wrong in what was happening i begged my husband not to marry me but he told me i had no choice
4306839 it was disgusting awful i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender inside it killed me inside life became meaningless i had my childhood taken away and missed out on all my teenage years sometimes i still wonder if its worth trying to have a future many days im not at all sure it is
4306840 our divisional vice president dan turner has been in touch with susan we have come to an agreement as to how the exchange should happen and i believe susan is pleased with the outcome

4306850 its been two years everybodys talking about we couldnt defend the pick and roll couldnt do this couldnt do that its not true we did prove that
4306851 i think they are the best team in the tournament right now
4306852 they are more focused on their goals and thats why theyre favorite for me
4306853 after their 2006 loss in the semifinal against us they came over here to prove that theyre a better team and that game was something bad for them theyre a team in the real meaning of the word and thats what they show on the court
4306854 because two years ago everybody would go coast to coast everybody could make the layup for greece
4306855 and today we saw that they used their bodies because theyre a very athletic team very athletic players thats the difference between the two games we played
4306856 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4306857 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4306858 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape

4306870 and on that hollow frozen day favre realized that thine teams pass rushers would be no match for the great satans offensive line should they meet in the super bowl knowing that the fate of football rested upon that game the gunslinger sacrificed the ball he gave his last pass to the new york football giants so that they may prevail lest evil reign the interception and win that the ageless one gave would be his last play in this mortal world his sacrifice was proven worthy as the giants would go on to slay the unholy tyrants the patriots with evil defeated for one more season favre passed his reigns to the next chosen one rodgers and he ascended to football heaven to drink the sweet ambrosia beer with the legends before him and it was remembered for eons to come that the last pass of his career was the one that lead to the downfall of the great satan the patriots amen
4306871 did you say shawna alexander what are you talking about that choose your massengill brand apparatus for i wonder if hes going to break the other wrist lifting next years five million what is that a million a first down
4306872 shaun we know the type of back he can be we know he has been hurt and it has affected his play the last couple years i am not ready to buy into the fact that he hit 30 and all of a sudden he cant play anymore as i have said so many times he was the lightning rod all last season it is going to be a show me type of year though but i am not ready to write that one off yet
4306873 you called us from the super bowl and for our listeners that dont know god almighty it was like
4306874 you were mad and angry at the world you wouldnt answer any of my questions you were un matt like
4306875 well you know its tough think about it youre down at the super bowl watching the new york giants play aggrivated groan you know it could have been us it could have been us
4306876 alright but you can put on a happy face youre playing football for goodness sakes now are you tired of getting brett favre questions
4306877 no its funny did he retire or something what happened
4306878 alright ill tell you one quick story mike sherman was the head coach so it might have been 2000 special teams practice is before the regular practice obvisouly a guy like brett favre doesnt have to be at special teams practice these special teams guys theyre sprinting down covering kick after kick you know we werent playing that well at the time bretts down there with his pitching wedge hitting golf balls you know the whiffle ball kind over these guys as theyre running you know as theyre practicing and the special teams coach is cursing him out under his breath and the players are kind of upset that hes doing it and you know im kind of offended to i think its wrong and im like oh wait until mike sherman gets down here he is going to say something to him you know mike sherman comes down sees what hes doing and im playing catch next to him and he goes hey brett come here i want to talk to you and im like oh trying to get closer kind of like leaning in and listening and sherman goes ahh ahh and he wimps out he goes how do you like the gameplan and that was it unbelievable
4306879 he had his own shower and bathroom that he used it wasnt for him but really it was just his you wouldnt go hes a good dude though man
4306880 you know i was kind of feeling the set up i was feeling it
4306881 did you notice in favres wrangler commerical that they dont get any pressure on him when he goes back to pass
4306882 you mean seattle seahawk game like or what game like are we talking about here
4306883 yeah he had a great year good pass protection we had good pass pro too
4306884 heres what i think seahawks fans should embrace about him leaving and maybe youre going to me that aaron rodgers is great whatever yadda yadda yadda but i would say hey were in the business of trying to scratch out contenders and even with their loss to the giants you had to leave there thinking that okay with ryan grant and some of these other guys and favre back probably for another year
4306885 yeah well you never know they also freed up what 11 2 million dollars worth of cap space i mean who knows they could improve their team in other ways right now i dont know
4306886 she hit her head on you know something who knows
4306887 by the way thats matts trying to be you know i cant disclose too much information
4306888 well she hit it on the wall its not a good story kind of like my other story not a good story
4306889 something like stitches super glue but thats kind of what im doing im trying to play dad you know im trying to stay in shape we start back up march 31st theres guys around working out obviously the guys that had surgery the walter jones the patrick kerneys the chris spencers those guys are around every day working out working hard weve got a new coaching staff sort of a new coaching staff almost entirely offensively and those guys are in there working hard every day having meetings ive gone up a few times to meet my new quarterback coach and every time i go up to see him hes in a meeting with you know gil haskell and gilby and mike solari these guys so theyre working hard
4306890 his name is bill lazor he came from the washington redskins
4306891 very happy for zorn not really surprised i mean people are like wow can you believe hes the head coach i think the people that know him that have really gotten to know him the past five years i mean he played for 10 years and hes been coaching for 20 i think hes ready hes got the skills you look for in a head coach
4306892 is he a little bizz is there something go on are all the circuits meeting in the middle there
4306893 well think about it if youre the redskins they just had steve spurrier you know and then they had joe gibbs and both those guys theyre not normal but what makes them different or what makes them great i think is their creativity their leadership style their leadership ability and i think jims the same hes not normal he owns a porsche and rides his bike to work every day you know who does that
4306894 mike wahle when i was drafted to the packers in 98 i was a nobody i just happened to be there mike wahle was drafted that same year in the supplemental draft so he came out late from the naval academy this guy has so much talent so much ability you know he played at the naval academy he was recruited as a defensive back ended up being i think their right tackle and really had no idea how to pass block but he was just a stud as a run blocker we took him in the second round and they tried to put him in on reggie white every day and you know reggie white basically took his lunch money every day but that year that guy cause i was on the practice squad he was on the active roster he worked harder than anybody and i think its obvious to see what happened in his career i mean year two three four five six i mean he became a great player
4306895 but heres the problem the problem are the two words you used that year i think what people are concerned about is if hes that good of a ballplayer you know his former team would have gone out of their way to keep him
4306896 yeah well there was a guy last year his team the raiders they got rid of him because they said he couldnt play anymore that he was too old and injured and his name is randy moss
4306897 well i think they got rid of him for different reasons does wahle have any of randy moss attitude in him
4306898 oh you had to name the name you had to bring up the name again didnt you
4306899 thats kind of who he is and im not talking as a player im talking as a person hes the kind of guy you dont really want to cross him when hes in a bad mood you know hell bite your head off a little bit
4306900 no rob simms if you get one guy to go out with at night and if you just want to have a good time and just laugh at somebody and also you know have somebody that can bench press 550 pounds with you rob simms is your guy
4306901 my expectation would be chris gray but the thing is with chris spencer having both shoulders operated on and i think his thumb or whatever he had you know chris gray is probably going to have to play a lot of center for these mini camps which will give i think rob simms a chance to learn the right guard posittion with chris gary standing right next to him the thing thats great about chris gray is hes not one of these veteran guys thats selfish and is just trying to protect his job he truly and honestly will help the guy next to him you know he hopes the day comes when someone can actually beat him out and that he can you know kind of move into the next phase of his career which is kind of a veteran mentor but no ones beat him out every year ive been here ive heard oh well this guys gonna replace chris gray it just doesnt happen
4306902 whos going to be the starting tight end in game 1
4306903 im predicting someone thats in college or will heller or i guess we just signed a guy jeb putzier
4306904 ive heard of him i dont know much about him i kind of get away in the offseason and let the coaches work hard right now
4306905 im being a dad were going to see the wiggles and stuff like that
4306906 no no i did that once it will never happen again
4306907 what about t j duckett what do you think about that
4306908 from what ive heard guys that have played with him they love him they think hes a great guy i remember him coming out of high school my youngest brother nathaniel i think was the same year as him coming out of high school my brother was you know whatever all american football player coming out but t j duckett was like the peyton manning of that class he was the name you knew i think all four years he was a stud at michigan state first round pick i dont know too much about what his career has been
4306909 you know what these means matt i hate to break the news to you but with duckett in town to help out on short yardage situations have you processed this yet
4306910 your numbers not going to be called for the quarterback sneak
4306911 because we all know youre not a good quarterback sneaker
4306912 mitch i love matt hasselbeck i phone him all the time and hes just not a very good quarterback sneaker
4306913 no no since its robbie tobecks birthday how can you be a good quarterback sneaker with robbie tobeck in front of you
4306914 when ruskell and holmgren got together and ruskell said to holmren how are we going to advance our third and fourth and short situation
4306915 we have to go get somebody a specialist for that so i just wanted you to know that
4306916 well weve got to work on that and thats what the offseason is for
4306917 a joy to coach day in and day out clearly one of the most unique individuals ive had the privilege to work with
4306918 well if you leave what the hell happens to me
4306919 well your position no longer exists here anymore and we dont have any other positions of the same type to put you in well what do we do with you
4306920 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4306921 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4306922 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues
4306923 since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4306924 american technicians did not check for the actual problem and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate mel minimum equipment list item the plane flew another 36 passenger carrying flights during december 21 31
4306925 i didnt like the way the contract the seahawks offered was broke down
4306926 the way it was divided the way it was back loaded i went out to see what i was really worth on the market and i was told that i wouldnt be the highest paid guy and im not the no 1 guy and i disagree with that
4306927 ryan plackemeier is a great punter and a great holder but theres no snapper in seattle and there aint nobody out there
4306928 i wanted to be in a job where i was successful and had the opportunity to be successful rather than going through all the trial and error you know testing all these people out that they think are good enough
4306929 its important because its about winning plain and simple when nobody believes in you and doesnt ask your opinion when a business man thinks he knows more about field goal kicking than me thats a problem whenever youre hiring a and firing specialists you need to talk to people that know them that know what is critical in making that unit successful thats the most important thing winning thats why we play to win
4306930 because the increase is 14 percent since adam vinatieri was considered the no 1 guy and he got the highest deal every deal that is signed in the next couple years will be higher than his its time to move forward
4306931 someone with the seahawks told me that adam vinatieri was an anomaly and no one deserved to be paid higher than him
4306932 but you cant base it off that you gotta base things off situations well josh youre not 85 percent over your career no but ive had 23 attempts from 50 or more and the guy youre comparing me to has had five and hes missed every game winner and ive made all mine but one

4306944 no i think its raw i bought it from whole foods
4306945 i dont know that we believe in the curse the players dont believe in the curse
4306946 a coachs job is to put his players in a position to succeed
4306947 christine gregoire frank chopp lisa brown youre hurting the state of washington
4306948 talented physical specimen who is still improving and should be a starter pretty early in his pro career
4306949 i have to do something for my family i love my mother and im doing the best thing i can to put her in a better situation
4306950 my mother didnt want to tell me during the season because she thought that it would take me off my game
4306951 so she waited until toward the end of the season to tell me once i realized that i figured i had to do what was best for us
4306952 no doubt that chilo has a chance to be a great football player
4306953 he has all the necessary attributes to become a dominating one the right attitude the right work habits the right physical skills he has quick feet for being such a big man and he also has tremendous explosiveness
4306954 i think hell be one of those players who just keeps getting better and better i like his fierce determination he knows what he wants and hes working to reach that goal theres no reason why he cant
4306955 i think it was a classic approach of a guy who had it in his mind what he was going to do
4306956 they only talk to people that agree with them so its not much of a decision
4306957 and thats why were so adamant about guys when it fits their situation to stay in school and capitalize on the next years development to show how they can make tremendous improvement in their value in that next year
4306958 its going to be tough because at the moment the level is high
4306959 we have to improve our whole package to be fast at every track its only a month since the operation on his hand but i hope it can be better and better because sometimes you can feel pain for longer when you are pushing so hard
4306960 this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win the usgp and with our bike and tyres working very well
4306961 i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again
4306962 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4306963 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4306964 if it had to be a foreigner couldnt it have been a german
4306965 my experience of managers in england was not that positive unfortunately at nottingham forest i had two different managers whom i would call typical old fashioned english managers
4306966 there is not a good reputation for old fashioned british coaches except for bobby robson because of his personality if you look around there are simply not that many of them abroad
4306967 with no disrespect they were more like socialisers hanging out with the lads but now things have changed i think steve mcclaren can do a good job
4306968 he was interested in the passion and succeeded really well in bringing some of that back
4306969 i always wanted to work abroad to experience different countries
4306970 holland has always been a respected football country in england they produce good footballers and good coaches i am only six weeks here but now i know why you can see why holland has a conveyer belt of talent
4306971 that is in the past i am not worried about my image i know what i have done in the past and this is a new adventure for me
4306972 i am not proving anything although maybe i am proving to myself i am one of those coaches who can travel abroad
4306973 i am trying to learn dutch but my priority is learning the football
4306974 i have put a lot of pressure on myself coming here for me it is no different managing fc twente to managing england or to managing middlesbrough there is always pressure and everyone is always looking at you to deliver results
4306975 musim kemarau menjadikan daun murbei makanan utama ulat sutra red kering sehingga pemeliharaan ulat sutra tidak bisa dilakukan dengan baik karena pasokan makanannya tidak ada
4306976 lahan yang kami gunakan untuk menanam murbei tadah hujan jadi kalau musim kemarau seperti ini sulit tumbuh tapi kalau musim hujan melimpah dan bisa menjaga kelangsungan produksi benang sutra
4306977 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4306978 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4306979 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4306980 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4306981 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4306982 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from
4306983 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4306984 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4306985 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4306986 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4306987 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government
4306988 i pay homage to those tortured years ago to those persecuted and those who suffered unjustly in prison
4306989 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4306990 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4306991 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community
4306992 the optimistic scenario is he wont accomplish much but he will be well regarded and respected by the people as a president who is not corrupt and does not take bribes
4306993 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
4306994 it was a particularly strong year at cannes and up until a few weeks ago it was looking as if there would be even more titles from cannes
4306995 a lot of strong work came in right at the end and due to three films arriving during the very last week of screenings there were films we had sort of committed to that we had to replace
4306996 the quality of the french films is notable and french filmmakers are extremely active this year
4306997 but one can also see the influence of the french film industry through international financing twelve films this year are totally or partially financed from france
4306998 what happens especially at a place like cannes is that people think in terms of box office i have nothing against box office concerns but people focused primarily on the troubles that might be faced in marketing this film and that colored a lot of the reaction
4306999 but this is a film that in many ways throws down a certain gauntlet it wants to show you an example of a successful revolution and then another example of an unsuccessful revolution and each half while a fully comprehensive film is helped exponentially by seeing the two parts back to back
4307000 even people who know wong kar wais film this will feel like a whole new film
4307001 it was so butchered so dissected but this one is it
4307002 it captures the glory of the film puts in the footage that weve been waiting for smoothes out the edges and the color looks magnificent this is the film that oph ls wanted to make
4307003 tens of millions of dollars are being wasted that could be used for those that truly need assistance with enough left over to give back to the taxpayers if that isnt enough incentive for the states to act then maybe a potential loss of federal funding is
4307004 today we are celebrating the start of a new era for our fabulous ford motor company the first product of our global product development system the all new fiesta is an outstanding symbol for our one ford vision of a single global company designing and building cars for customers around the world be proud of what you have achieved and be proud of your contribution to a model that will get the world talking
4307005 the ford fiesta is very special to us in ford of europe and to our customers
4307006 over the past 32 years it has consistently been at the top of the list of europes best selling cars
4307007 its dynamic bold design and high manufacturing quality will attract a new generation of fiesta owners and appeal to existing customers i am confident that the all new fiesta will build on the success of its predecessor
4307008 were very proud of the cologne assembly plant and the vehicles produced here not only does the new fiesta bring innovative design and engineering to the small car market but it brings new manufacturing technologies as well
4307009 i tried working out and it didnt work for me
4307010 joining us from the seattle pi ladies and gentlemen here he is its supposed to be the offseason for clare farnsworth whats going on i mean arent you supposed to get to go to tahiti for two weeks
4307011 the guy that looks more like jerry garcia every day wishes he was in tahiti
4307012 well there are some photos floating around of me in my visor and sunglasses
4307013 now were not talking about jerry garcia as he looks today
4307014 so whats going on here every time i turn around theres a new running back
4307015 is this like trading cards theyre going to buying them cheap and theyre going to sell them expensive i mean what
4307016 tim ruskell keeps taking them and folding him over the spokes in his bicycle so they get worn out
4307017 lets go back to indianapolis spending a few days in indianapolis and at one point sitting down with as you described him a very refreshed mike holmgren getting ready to embark on his final year as the head coach of the seahawks he made it fairly clear to you that he didnt buy into the whole shaun alexander is shot theory and while not saying it specifically pretty much implied that shaun alexander would be back this coming year that was a t j duckett and julius jones ago what about now
4307018 and before we get to julius jones even with the duckett signing i wondered okay how are they gonna activate all these guys all these runners when they dont double as special teams guys how are all the numbers going to work out on that and that was before julius jones
4307019 yeah and then 2 you have to factor in the losses of kevin bentley and niko koutivides in free agency so they need more guys to play special teams now to fill in
4307020 right but it was described to me they could still do it the numbers could still work they could have shaun alexander mo morris and t j duckett all active along with leonard weaver all active duckett could be the emergency backup fullback and all those guys could excuse themselves from special teams and they can get backup linebackers and backup wide receivers to fill in the special teams now they go out and sign julius jones which changes the dynamic again how do you sense this changes the dynamic
4307021 its funny because the immediate thought is this is the guy to replace shaun alexander
4307022 well thats the thing thats been pointed out to me that this guy not only by people at the seahawks but scouts from other teams is more like maurice morris hes that kind of counter punch runner you saw that in dallas despite being the 16 game starter last year marion barber just kind of took over down there and jones had career lows in just about everything is the combination of these two guys enough to push alexander off the roster maybe not maybe that back comes in the draft maybe theyre not done yet despite all the stuff theyve done
4307023 or more and more assurance that he would be the featured running back do you really believe that he came in here they offered him less money than others they told him that that hed have to compete with shaun alexander told him that their plans were for shaun alexander to still be the featured back and he would still sign here without going to other places that doesnt seem kosher to me
4307024 he did go to detroit and he did go to tennessee and there was greater money and more opportunity at those two places
4307025 he doesnt catch the ball out of the backfield particularly well correct
4307026 no and hes not exactly a square your shoulders and slam it up into the hole guy either
4307027 neither is mo morris if im reading you right it sounds like clare farnsworth is convinced that as of this moment its going to be shaun alexander julius jones and t j duckett
4307028 and mo morris would be out the streets looking for a job
4307029 that gets me thinking to getting some sort of pass receiving skills out of the backfield
4307030 he was adequate he could catch three or four balls in a game and get out there can julius jones be as adequate a receiver as mo morris
4307031 yeah earlier in his career he had some catches until marion barber moved in and started pushing him out
4307032 if thats the case im fine with mo morris out and julius jones in i think julius jones no matter how limited he is gives you much more upside as a running back in terms of a featured back than mo morris does so im fine with that i just think if they go duckett jones alexander that you really dont have the guy that go out and be a factor in the passing game
4307033 how are you going to get rashard mendenhall when hes a top 15 pick
4307034 there are possibilities in the draft there are other backs as well that could step in here you know the thing that keeps gnawing at me mitch is that we know have a coach in waiting here for next season and when you look at the offense he ran in atlanta there was t j duckett the pounder back there was warrick dunn and maybe julius jones is kind of a smaller back in that vain and then you had an elusive very able to run around quarterback and gee is that seneca wallace but i guess thats fodder for a different day
4307035 do we know what mike holmgren thinks of all this
4307036 well he thinks the duckett deal was a role that wasnt fulfilled on this team and he was kind of a little excited by the julius jones thing
4307037 well after he left the building but before it was announced
4307038 so mike holmgren was excited about the possibility of bringing julius jones on board
4307039 yeah and i think the thing he really liked was that julius jones left him with the impression that this was the team he really wanted to play with that he really wanted to be here and as you know with holmgren and now especially with ruskell coming in that thats a huge factor with these guys the character of the player and the fact that they want to be part of this team
4307040 i hope mike holmgren isnt fooled into believing that julius jones is only the running back on that 30 carry 198 yard night on monday night
4307041 yes lets hope they watched more film than that one game
4307042 because you call dallas and they dont get very nice thoughts about julius jones they think hes a stiff in dallas
4307043 yeah and its the same knocks you hear on alexander that he goes into the fetal position when he gets hit he cant do this and he cant do that talking to scouts from some other teams yesterday they were surprised by this singing its kind of like well why would you sign this guy and they also bring up well hes more maurice morris than shaun alexander
4307044 assuming they can get something done with trufant which i dont think is a very safe assumption to give them some salary cap relief obviously if they cant get something done theyre done in free agency if they can get something done whats the next thing to happen in free agency a tight end
4307045 well they got jeb putzier and i think hes the third guy i think theyre looking heavily at the draft for a tight end a tight end originally that can work in the mix you have will heller here still and putzier gives you more than joppru did
4307046 have you heard anything about eric johnson the free agent out of new orleans
4307047 no and its funny when he came free from the 49ers i was surprised we didnt hear more about him but i think there are injury concerns with him theyve talked to a couple of linebackers which is what they need now theyve lost bentley and koutivides so they need linebackers who can backup and play special teams
4307048 oh thats where the sherif keeps prisoners in tents and feed them for less than the patrol dogs
4307049 what exactly looks smaller cuz i dont see nuthin doc
4307050 are you having any pregnancy symptoms still any spotting etc
4307051 gawd yes and no no spotting or anything boobs hurt nausea yup cravings yes some peeing constantly yesssssssssssssssssssss puking yes twice etc
4307052 hi cyn your number is 40 000 thats good so dr wants you to go to radiology tomorrow for a cootchie ultrasound on their fancy newer machine down there they can squeeze you in at 11 30 tomorrow morning is that ok
4307053 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
4307054 right now we have a chance to catch up with one of the up and coming stars in the seahawks backfield thats kelly jennings kelly good morning how are you
4307055 actually im in northern florida in live oak where im from
4307056 in live oak theres not much to do but sit around and visit with family
4307057 so were not going to see kelly jennings in the everglades chasing alligators any time
4307058 i love it well tell me about how your offseasons gone man i mean obviously the green bay game left a real bitter taste in everyones mouth im sure including yours but what have the last couple months been like for you
4307059 its been real laid back real chill for me i just got back from the bahamas i took a trip up to north carolina and now im back in florida just kind of relaxing and getting away from everything trying to get my body and my mind back focused
4307060 i gotta ask you who did you go to the bahamas with
4307061 good for you man outstanding you finally got somebody to take the bait i love it thats a beautiful thing congratulations on that
4307062 hey tell me about your thoughts on the way 2007 went not just the team but also for you and i guess well start with you your second year in the nfl making the jump from obviously your rookie season tell me about your thoughts on how the year went for kelly jennings
4307063 i think it went pretty good i think i made some great leaps and bounds from the previous year everything just kind of started to slow down for me i didnt have to think as much i could just use my talent and play i think theres still a whole lot of room for improvement that im going to work on here in the offseason but overall i think i did well and i just hope to get better for the upcoming season
4307064 you talk about room for improvement theres always room for improvement you could be an all pro and theres room for improvement
4307065 what about that though what about a couple of two three things that you can share with us where if you sat down with your position coach jim mora and said okay here are maybe a couple of things i want to get better at as my career goes by and maybe even more so i want to get better at right now so i can be a better player in 2008 what would those two or three things be
4307066 no 1 is just trusting myself there were a lot of times i would come back to coach in film and id be like i saw that or i had that feeling it was coming but just because i didnt want to take that chance or mess up i wouldnt do it thats the one thing just trusting myself using my instincts a little bit more two is just relaxing and getting a little bit more physical on the field
4307067 you talk about the game slowing down for you is that truly the case do you feel like its starting to slow down with you the more games you play
4307068 yeah the game is still fast but i think as you mature in the league and learn how to study and know what to expect youre not so much on the edge and so jittery that it starts to slow down for you and becomes more repetitive youre like ive seen this play before ive seen this formation before youre not as worried and trying to expect everything
4307069 whats the difference between college wide receivers and nfl wide outs
4307070 one of the biggest transitions college wide outs you have some great ones some not as great so its not as tough in the nfl youre against great receivers week in and week out and you have to be on top of your game every minute
4307071 how much did things change for you with he arrival of jim mora last year was his first with the seahawks and the defensive passer rating skyrocketed from the 06 to 07 what about you what was the biggest difference for you under jim mora
4307072 his energy he brings a lot of energy not only to the field but to the meeting room hes open to suggestions theres so many different guys in the room and so many different ways to do different things and hes open to guys talking and seeing what were more comfortable with then just well this is my way and this is the way were gonna do it i think that made it easier for everybody and we were able to play better
4307073 have you ever played in a situation where you know your position coach is going to be the head coach the next season thats got to be weird
4307074 it is this is my first time being in a situation like that its going to be real interesting to see how that goes and play into it
4307075 are you concerned with that at all theres been some thought thrown around that hey theres going to be a split camp between the mora guys and the holmgren guys this the first time youve ever played in that scenario its the first time ive ever heard of it at the nfl level i think this is pretty much unprecedented is there any concern on your part about how this is going to work in the 08 season
4307076 theres no concern im sure coach holmgren and coach mora have talked about it coach holmgren is still the head coach this year and hes going to run his system his way i guess theyll slowly implement at the end of the season or whenever they do it coach mora will implement his stuff but im sure coach holmgren its going to be his camp his way until everythings over
4307077 how much do you allow yourself to think about what happened in green bay
4307078 i try not to and its hard to get away from it because you have fans and people you see who mention the game and talk about it you have to relive it and i think its always good to relive it sometimes too because theres always things that you can take from that game and improve on and get better the next season so its not so bad
4307079 i dont know im not sure we came in and we started real well and then it all went south for us it was like once we hit that downward slope there was nothing we could do to get it back right green bay did a great job of running their offense it just turned out to be a bad day for us
4307080 were you pleased to hear brett favre is walking away
4307081 i wouldnt say pleased i mean he gave us 17 great years i loved watching him play its going to be funny to not have him playing i guess i have mixed emotions about him retiring
4307082 thats a difficult guy to replace im not sure if you can mention green bay among the top nfc teams anymore
4307083 its going to be interesting to see what aaron rodgers does im sure he studied a lot behind brett favre and tried to take things from it but brett favre is a hard person to replace hes done so much so it will be interesting to see what happens
4307084 is there any doubt in your mind that you wont be playing next to marcus trufant in 2008 is there any concern at all
4307085 im not concerned at all i know the systems going to work the way that its going to work but you know i really feel in my heart ill be playing beside tru and i hope so because me and tru developed a great relationship it will be interesting to see what happens
4307086 coming from being confined and forgetting what its like to have your freedom and to be on your own
4307087 i wish people could see me for who i am instead of seeing that i just got released from prison
4307088 its hard in the economic times that were facing right now to get people to donate money
4307089 sometimes we take on more riskier clientele and in order to be a more professional facility we need to have around the clock staff
4307090 go home no go to the doctor then go home right now and feel better
4307091 if kickers are drafted a lot of research is done to make sure they can get the job done at the nfl level i think serna is an nfl kicker especially as a field goal kicker he didnt have good kickoff stats this past season but he is so accurate and hes kicked in bad weather someone will take a really good look at him
4307092 ive got beaver fever and the only cure is more alexis serna
4307093 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly
4307094 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4307095 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa quality assurance and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4307096 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
4307097 this piece of code was left over from the prerelease versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2
4307098 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
4307099 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
4307100 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4307101 its real strength is in providing a rich framework that developers can easily build upon optimize collaborate around and then deploy on billions of devices
4307102 in this way lwuit is becoming a unifying ui layer that allows developers to focus on creating compelling user interfaces and ultimately delivering new and engaging applications across a wide range of platforms
4307103 oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
4307104 i have to know what theyre laughing at but i bet they are laughing at that freakin national anthem
4307105 why it is the most far reaching ever is the significant partnership we have with rural the rural policemen so that would be the county sheriffs and city policemen and today we have 41 parters who will be helping with the rural roads
4307106 and while a death in the family is always difficult and emotionally wrenching when a life is cut short by the unfortunate and trageic circumstances of drinking and driving the emotional and physical tramua is horrendous and overwhelming

4307110 we are for peace but not for peace at any price not peace with a gun to our heads if there is a peace agreement it must go through the proper procedures and consultations not just between the government and the milf but with the citizens of mindanao
4307111 we view this as unconstitutional there was lack of consultation the creation of the bje is tantamount to a partitioning of our country and this we cannot allow to pass
4307112 this is multi party belonging to all parties is represented at the house of representatives it is introduced by emmylou tali o mendoza from north cotabato darlene antonino custodio from south cotabato and ben climaco from zamboanga city the three ladies had put this resolution together and we see here that there is a 136 signatures by their colleagues in the house of representatives who had signed on and agreed to call for a renegotiations of this moa because they disagree that our country will be chop chop as it is envisioned in the moa
4307113 we told them that the moa was needed to build the confidence of the milf in the negotiations and that sometimes processes like this require confidentiality
4307114 the moa is not the final agreement thats one of the issues clarified
4307115 it will go through an intricate long drawn constitutional process
4307116 it is about time even long overdue to lay this obsolete concept to rest in the philippines
4307117 it is best for the sanity of the emerging national debate on the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad where more light rather than heat is needed

4307123 we dont want to create a class of victims and witnesses that can be preyed upon because of a fear of calling police
4307124 i see families living in fear i know families that havent called police
4307125 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4307126 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4307127 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4307128 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4307129 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4307130 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from
4307131 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people

4307143 it is logical that the atlantic islands will become a future region in their own right and so the azores will feature on those itineraries
4307144 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4307145 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4307146 many people know chris jericho as a wwe legend but he is also a musician and the lead singer of his own band fozzy

4307152 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4307153 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4307155 orang yang men zhihar istrinya di antara kamu menganggap istrinya sebagai ibunya padahal tiadalah istri mereka itu ibunya ibu ibu mereka tidak lain hanyalah yang melahirkan mereka dan sesungguhnya mereka sungguh sungguh mengucapkan suatu perkataan yang munkar dan dusta dan sesungguhnya allah maha pemaaf lagi maha pengampun

4307157 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4307158 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4307159 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4307160 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4307161 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4307162 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4307163 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4307164 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4307165 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4307166 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4307167 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4307168 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4307169 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4307170 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4307171 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4307172 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4307173 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4307174 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4307175 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4307176 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4307177 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4307178 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4307179 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4307180 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4307181 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4307182 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4307183 i think you can write more constructive things than this if you wanted to
4307184 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4307185 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4307186 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4307187 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4307188 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4307189 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4307190 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4307191 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4307192 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4307193 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4307194 beware of false prophets for they come in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves
4307195 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4307196 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4307197 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4307198 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4307199 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4307200 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4307201 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4307202 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4307203 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4307204 these meetings are all part of our preparation for the long term council community plan which sets out our direction for the next 10 years the council wants to work with people involved in the arts to gauge where the sector is now where it needs to go in the future and how to work in partnership to make this happen
4307205 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4307206 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4307207 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4307208 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4307209 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4307210 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4307211 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4307212 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4307213 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4307214 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4307215 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4307216 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4307217 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4307218 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4307219 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4307220 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4307221 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4307262 whereas bringing concealed weapons into the church sends a message that is at odds with what the church wants to communicate and violates the religious character of religious property and whereas the work of the church does not involve or require weapons now be it resolved that the delegates to the 2008 session of the north georgia annual conference oppose any attempts by the state legislature to allow anyone other than law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in houses of worship and be it further resolved that we invite members of other churches and faiths in georgia to join us in this effort

4307291 five years ago lightning hit it and the computer got burned out
4307292 we keep working on them to repair it but its not reparable because the older system is 20 years old
4307293 we have gotten 3 500 just today alone because community members feel very passionate about getting it repaired
4307294 well a city ordinance if you did it it would be against the law right
4307295 the firefighters out there for muscular dystrophy on the street i dont support anybody being in the street where theres traffic movement for purposes of fund raising
4307296 and there is an intimidation factor going on theyre trying to make people feel guilty if you dont give them money
4307297 for the charities they dont really do it a whole lot maybe two or three times a year ive seen them out
4307298 so i could see if they had a permit to do it just for a certain period or certain area
4307299 the problem with michael phelps is theres no competition where he is
4307300 now if he came to where im from which is the inner city liberty city in miami i was the three time charles hadley pool champ
4307301 dont laugh i know a couple people who could beat michael phelps right now seriously im telling you and im one of them
4307302 hey i love yall man im tellin you enjoy the season dont talk about me because if you talk about me im comin to look for you
4307303 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4307304 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4307305 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4307306 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4307307 the only thing it appears they can do is to either overpay for a couple of big free agents or trade jake peavy for a bunch of prospects what else can they do
4307308 if the governments statutory construction is correct and the computer fraud amp abuse act criminalizes violating a website terms of service then the statute is void for vagueness because it fails to provide warning of what is prohibited and ensures discriminatory enforcement
4307309 i think public opinion is more concerned with economic issues the economy isnt very good and there are worries about social inequalities
4307310 the japan of today is the result of the sacrifices of those who fought and died in the war and i feel a sense of gratitude to them
4307311 for china to complain is interference in japans domestic affairs
4307312 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
4307313 young people are sympathising because they see themselves and todays situation today in the novel
4307314 the sympathy is sporadic and i dont think it will lead to organised movements
4307315 things are different now from the stable employment conditions of japans period of high economic growth
4307316 life time employment is gone and its uncertain whether people will receive their pensions
4307317 the novels like a dream everyone uniting fighting and winning together
4307318 but i doubt well see that type of reaction now
4307319 a rich person would never let his child do this
4307320 if we didnt send her away to sports school she would have ended up a farmer
4307321 i have put my heart and soul into my comeback and done everything i could to get ready in time to compete in beijing
4307322 obviously this person is clearly doing this for the shock value he shes just looking for mothers attention or making some film of what its like to live in crap town in a car
4307323 sa bilis na binagsak ng krudo sa world market 146 to 139 napakaliit ang p1 50 na yan tapos p1 ngayon demand namin at least para magkaroon ng impact sa amin agad dapat at least isang bagsak p7 rollback agad yan with the sudden drop in world oil prices from 146 to 139 the p1 50 liter and the recent p1 liter rollbacks are paltry if we are to feel the effects of the price decrease we demand no less than a rollback of p7 liter
4307324 nagbabarat magbaba ang malalaki naghihintay ang big oil companies tumaas uli sa market gusto nila palabasin dapat natuwa na tayo sa rollback the big oil firms are waiting for prices to go up again so they dont have to roll back prices again they even want us to be grateful to them
4307325 di natin niru rule out ang ganoong option na patuloy sila nakita nating parang niloloko tayo kasabwat ang gobyerno sa panloko sa atin we are not ruling out that option especially if they are deceiving us we dont want a government that connives with oil firms in making fools out of us
4307326 im in love with you i want to spend forever with you and when its been forever ill ask for one more day
4307327 the people were saying why didnt he pitch against sabathia
4307328 sheets is every bit of what sabathia is this guy started the all star game a matchup like that is what a competitor loves to do
4307329 absolutely i did get upset a little bit it did give me some motivation
4307330 what a big day for the guys to come back and beat a guy like ben sheets especially after hes been so dominant
4307331 any time you match up with somebody like that you know runs are going to be at a premium those are fun days and days youre not going to forget
4307332 they both know that they are elite pitchers and theyre trying to outdo each other
4307333 you would be hard pressed to find another game where you have two competitors of that magnitude on the mound in the same game
4307334 you could sense right away that was going to be a good one
4307335 those pitchers dont give up many runs so you have to try and scratch when you get a chance
4307336 he gave me some pitches to hit and fortunately i was able to do something with them
4307337 the balls werent hit too hard they hit them where we werent
4307338 i dont think anyone should get in the way of what i want im not going to feel bad if i go out and race my heart out and end up winning
4307339 the most important thing is being able to separate the two races and just most on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me is the psychological part
4307340 he just loves to get in and race the best and that pushes michael and that pushes aaron peirsol
4307341 i think aaron and michael both know that hes a threat when hes on and i think those are going to be two very exciting races to watch
4307342 thats a swim to get me into the meet a little bit
4307343 its been a long week waiting and watching a lot of ups and downs finally im in the meet and i can relax and do my race a little bit better
4307344 i didnt have much speed the first 50 but i think i came home pretty good i just need to put myself out there a little more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4307345 ill just try to set myself up for a good final and go from there
4307346 its nothing you can control and its going to happen so theres no real reason to get all huffy about it
4307347 ive had a great time this year i see a lot of future in this team i left an organization in tampa that has gotten good id hate to leave this place and see them get good as well
4307348 the preliminary stuff i got is they just want to shut him down for a while

4307351 i thank you so much for the densifier 5000 after my 3rd daughter was born i tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked then i figured out that losing weight wasnt the answer but getting dense was now thanks to the densifier 5000 i finally have the tight sexy body that ive always wanted and i did it without exercise diet or drugs my husband jim was so excited when he saw me that he rushed over and picked me up in a loving bear hug or at least he tried to that poor man pulled something in his back and now he just cries and cries i still weigh 300 pounds and get winded walking from the couch to the fridge but i look great
4307352 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4307353 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4307354 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4307355 it tells us where the kids are sitting right now and what the teachers are actually doing in school
4307356 despite all of these external problems going on our teachers stayed on focus on target with these students and the students were able to close this off
4307357 lt hamilton conducted a reconnaissance of the dalmation islands to plot alternate shipping routes in event of german invasion which then was starting he was strafed by german planes and conducted himself in a brave manner

4307360 comparing the current episode to the last 20 years which includes the recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s the level of claims was higher during those downturns than it is currently but the level never got as high as it is now without going even higher
4307361 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
4307362 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me
4307363 if im so fine can you get off my fineness then

4307366 okay well it better be nice and let me make one thing clear
4307367 i will not sleep in the same bed with you
4307368 of course there just futons so we could always scoot them together
4307369 now i want to know why you are here i thought you wanted to live a normal life as much as possible
4307370 i dont know it was boring not really having anyone to talk to its not like its easy to make friends now that i dont go to school or anything so i thought i would try to find you because youre nice to me
4307371 i shouldnt try to interfere so much with your work but seriously miki

4307374 thats as a result of gold falling overnight and continuing to decline in the asian session today
4307375 it actually fell below the critical the us 800 an ounce level this morning
4307376 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4307377 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4307378 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4307379 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4307380 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4307381 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4307382 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4307383 its difficult to even to think that i could be compared with those great names like seve ballesteros he was an idol of mine
4307384 i have always been good in those situations the more my back is to the wall the better i get i have always been good in those situations you just have to be
4307385 on 16 17 and 18 i had to make those putts on 18 i said if i hole this putt i will win the pga championship if i lag it down there i could go into a play off and i would have less control over things
4307386 the worst things you can do in a major championship is let anyone else have chance
4307387 i can hit all the shots and have all the belief but you
4307388 my idols have not necessarily been the unbelievably talented ones but the guys who have worked hard at their game and got the most out of their talent
4307389 ben hogan went from being a struggling professional to being probably the best ball striker of all time and definitely one of the best players of all time
4307390 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4307391 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4307392 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4307393 by firing the laser through the beam control system for the first time the atl team has begun to demonstrate the functionality of the entire weapon system integrated aboard the aircraft
4307394 this is a major step toward providing the ultra precision engagement capability that the warfighter needs to dramatically reduce collateral damage
4307395 fired its high energy chemical laser through its beam control system the beam control system acquired a ground target and guided the laser beam to the target as directed by atls battle management system
4307396 by firing the laser through the beam control system for the first time the atl team has begun to demonstrate the functionality of the entire weapon system integrated aboard the aircraft
4307397 its been great of course playing for 30 minutes feels like five minutes on stage the guys dont really get to solo but theres an unspoken sense of camaraderie there with the other artists jack bruce is great and were having a lot of fun with flo and eddie
4307398 yes but surprisingly there are a lot of kids too the children and grandchildren of the original fans theyre all looking for something meaningful in music thats going to create a sense of unity and purpose
4307399 i was never a hippie but i was always hip i didnt care much
4307400 touring with all the airports tour buses hotels and taxis
4307401 otherwise i enjoy being home reading books watching films riding my motorcycle i enjoy the best of both worlds in that i can go to the store without getting mobbed by fans like some of my contemporaries
4307402 i have a lot of new material i need to sort through when i get home from this tour for the time being im releasing a limited edition cd box set of my two latest studio albums my secret life and soul of a man with bonus material hopefully for christmas
4307403 his music let it be known what his true persona was a big guy with a big heart as real as his music bo taught me dont stop for nothing just keep rockin stand your ground he was a perfect gentleman at all times he taught me to never lose my sense of humor
4307404 i was put out of business in the united states
4307405 some progress has been made but much more needs to be done
4307406 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4307407 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4307408 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4307409 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4307410 hed known for a really long time that he was no longer a really good writer
4307411 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4307412 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4307413 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4307414 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4307415 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4307416 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4307417 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4307418 but it certainly is not rehabilitation by any stretch of the imagination and it is not re naturalization which is a term they use and im not really sure what that means but it is cleanup i would describe it as cosmetic cleanup theyre taking out the trash
4307419 theyre covering their compost pits with a little bit of soil which could attract bears
4307420 theyve covered up slit trenches without really cleaning anything theyve covered up fire pits with branches and trunks of trees these folks interchangeably use cleanup and rehab and they like to use rehab but based on what im seeing its not rehab
4307421 i was told they put watermelon rinds underneath and put soil on top and then placed pine needles and lodgepole pines on top and placed on top of that dead and downed materials like needles and pine cones from the forest
4307422 the basic procedure is to break it up and re level the area and if necessary you seed it but the new seeds dont take until the rains come
4307423 the duff retains moisture and is full of local seeds and it prevents the ground underneath from drying out and it also helps it blend into the landscape
4307424 its just like mulching your garden the natural mulch is the forest litter under the tree canopy
4307425 its not a native plant but it outcompetes the plants that are native and we want to manage the forest for native plants
4307426 between security and corporate payoffs the dnc will cost over 100 million dollars for a party we think the people deserve that money
4307427 join us as we encircle the denver mint and use our collective power to raise the mint building in the air and shake the money out of it for the people
4307428 were going to have a couple thousand people surround this entire building and theyre going to be bringing all their magic all their energy and everything that they have with them and the idea is were going to raise this building up in the air with a little bit of singing a little bit of dancing
4307429 the way we look at it there is so much disparity between the rich and the poor right now that we want to take some of that money out of the hands of the greedy and what better place than the denver mint
4307430 the united states mint police do work with the secret service and during that week obviously there will be a lot more security details located in the city but the facility of the united states mint will be protected by the united states mint police and it will be like i said business as usual
4307431 we call ourselves recreate 68 and we want to do a little something to remember abbie hoffman and jerry rubin and the folks that came before us
4307432 and this is kind of our ode to them and also our respect to the poor communities here cause poverty is a killer and we think this is a good way to bring some attention to that issue
4307433 the protesters ought to spend their time doing something else if you ask me
4307434 he cares about his on court performance more than he ever has in his life
4307435 whatever adelman needs me to do come off the bench be the sixth or seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4307436 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4307437 we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far
4307438 how that will work out on the 360 with microsofts process remains to be seen
4307439 led to huge changes in british society and changes which i think we are still living with now
4307440 its going to be tough because at the moment the level is high
4307441 we have to improve our whole package to be fast at every track its only a month since the operation on his hand but i hope it can be better and better because sometimes you can feel pain for longer when you are pushing so hard
4307442 this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win the usgp and with our bike and tyres working very well
4307443 i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again
4307444 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4307445 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4307446 it would be nice if i can put pressure on right up until the last lap
4307447 ze vroeg of het vuur in het olympisch stadion s avonds uit werd gedaan ze zou wel eens kunnen verrassen
4307448 vijf maanden geleden zag ik dat mijn tegenstanders sneller vooruit waren gegaan dan ik het heeft me wakker geschud ik voel me nu beter dan ooit maar doe geen voorspellingen meer
4307449 ik moet zelf weer jagen op anderen waardoor je de sport anders beleeft het is me op een harde manier duidelijk geworden dat ik beter voor de dag moet komen
4307450 waarschijnlijk leefde ik te ontspannen naar dat wk toe ik was iets te gemakkelijk nu is de felheid weer terug
4307451 deze winter dacht ik vooruitgang te boeken door iets zwaarder te gaan rijden omdat ik met mijn leeftijd meer kracht op de pedalen moet kunnen overbrengen het was zeker geen verkeerde keuze maar de oude kleinere versnelling voelt weer goed
4307452 met de dag begin ik hier sneller te rijden ik heb een kleine week last gehad van een jetlag en ook aan de baan moest ik weer even wennen met de teamsprint staan we er goed voor de wetenschap dat ik een sprinter ben die in een toernooi groeit sterkt me de individuele sprint is over drie dagen verspreid dat is zeker in mijn voordeel
4307453 if i moved out of here theyd hang me and bury me in a pot field
4307454 im glad they got it off the street but you know theres more
4307455 the guys who sold us back our 100 pounds of diesel soaked marijuana
4307456 but if they made it legal id probably grow it
4307457 you think id be out here in the heat if i was growing marijuana
4307458 i call for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and the cease fire agreement to be honored
4307459 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks and people out here at the agency have been incredibly helpful
4307460 different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4307461 largely the violence has died down over the last 24 hours
4307462 this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win the usgp and with our bike and tyres working very well
4307463 i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again
4307464 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4307465 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4307466 it would be nice if i can put pressure on right up until the last lap
4307467 its going to be tough because at the moment the level is high
4307468 some do it to beat up cars but a lot of guys go out there to be the last man standing
4307469 you always want to win but if you dont its still a good year
4307470 they were more than excited to jump in and help
4307471 its a great chance for them to pick up tools theyve never used and do something theyve never done
4307472 it got them away from the playstation for a while
4307473 it was nice working with all of them it was nice to get out and do something
4307474 working on a car and using all the tools was the best part
4307475 i hope i can show up well for them they put in a lot of work
4307476 its intense twelve or so cars in a football field going at it its fun to watch and probably to be in too
4307477 i told a lot of people about it and they made fun of me for it
4307478 i am sure they are going to go for this after seeing these pictures
4307479 i love just the noise from the cars the horsepower the loud exhaust and the metal flying every where
4307480 people are angry at life people are getting laid off and gas prices are on the rise
4307481 i dont know of a better way to take out those frustrations than to hit that yellow car
4307482 we kind of got away from our own process and our own focus of winning games of football and started looking behind our back a bit
4307483 i dont know exactly what i am going to do after the olympics but i am going to take a long break and think about something else
4307484 for how long i dont know it could be one month six months a year but i am definitely going to think about something else and spend more time with my family and friends especially esther baron a swimmer who didnt qualify for the games who is not here
4307485 i really want to see all those who are close to me and werent able to be here with me
4307486 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played

4307493 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
4307494 is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale
4307495 its been insane since early this morning i think there were like 500 people waiting outside to get in

4307724 the absence of medfly appearances anywhere else in the continental u s besides california over the past two decades strongly supports the argument that the medfly has never been completely eradicated in our state
4307725 the reappearances of the medfly in the same cities and even in the same locations within these cities is due to a long term established population

4308169 for years since the fall of the soviet union russia has been resisting western attempt so woo the breakaway states that surround it inherently paranoid russia sees such encroachment as a threat and in various ways it has tried to demonstrate that displeasure with acts which have been condemned by the rest of the world such as cutting off a pipeline which runs through the ukraine when displeased with that country essentially russia wants barrier states between it and the west who it still really doesnt trust it understand s i think that the former eastern bloc nations it once held under its influence are pretty much lost to it but the former soviet states which border it are not
4308170 for the slither of american working men and women who belong to unions because if you re not in a union you re not working apparently there is some good news from colorado according to ben degrow of the independence institute as of today the entirety of colorado state government is officially unionized how do they do it first democratic governor bill ritter signed an executive order state employee partnerships last year rather than allowing a debate in the legislature or bringing the issue to the people then 7 669 workers imposed unionization and so called protections on 24 305 workers who didn t vote for it presto the state of colorado is ready for the democratic national convention
4308171 in theory cultural competence in the classroom can involve nothing more than training teachers to be more effective with children from diverse backgrounds for example a teacher may take a student s race into account when assigning readings in history that are most likely to interest him but the term is notoriously vague and elastic in its application this is not surprising after all its two component words culture and competence are themselves difficult to define most of the formal definitions that are offered in policy statements clarify little
4308172 when leases on private land pay royalties of 12 to 25 why should taxpayers only receive 12 to 16 what about decades of royalty underpayments on taxpayer owned land and indian tribal land and allotments what about the 68 million acres already being leased but not being drilled why grant more oil shale leases when the five current demonstration leases are years from producing commercially viable oil from a source whose promise of bonanza has failed three times in the past 120 years bankrupting dozens of companies and soaking up hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies nonetheless the rush is on and the republicans have an ace up their sleeve the ban on additional off shore leases must be renewed each year by september 30
4308173 in the georgia we experienced the dislike of russian interference was nothing if not ramped up during the soviet takeover of the country we were nowhere near south ossetia which is the current powder keg yet there is no reason to doubt that both russian and georgian political forces have been muddying whatever the real local sentiment might be and there s surely more than one given the long history of troubles in this area there s no real way of trying to identify who started it either but all this really highlights a fundamental problem of today s nation statism issues and ideologies get so conflated and combined that historical grievances are compounded rather than relieved and shot through all this is the messy truth that underneath all the political posturing and firing there are individuals on all sides who just want to be left alone to try to eke out whatever living they can and who are being killed simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time
4308174 electricity is so commonplace that no one gives any thought to not having access to it few give any consideration to how it is generated but we are now being inundated with the most virulent nonsense about how wind or solar power is clean and practically free every week there s some new proposal to cover the nation with wind farms and solar panels the problem for everyone who wants to get rich with these energy sources or those who think they are the answer to our energy needs is that neither wind nor solar can ever power anything more than relatively small projects like a farm or a local stadium a nation of more than three hundred million people however needs a lot of generation capacity

4308179 as early as 1992 the adam smith institute propagated the use of marketable permits for tackling high co2 emissions this cap and trade system means that while the government has limited the overall value of emissions firms polluters can trade their pollution permits the incentive to reduce emissions is created by the cost of buying extra permits and selling your surplus if you are more efficient so only 13 years later the eu entered phase i 2005 2007 of its emissions trading system that sought to do just that over the same time period co2 emissions in the eu rose 1 9 why does the market approach appear to have failed

4308186 barack obama can say it but it doesnt make it true
4308187 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
4308188 were pleased to see that because there is tremendous uncertainty over obamas plans for the economy and for the stock market and for the markets overall

4308191 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4308192 basically you are looking at an even race in virginia
4308193 but we think mccain is a republican who matches up very well in virginia
4308194 they are now seeing the same things we are seeing which is it is really close in virginia
4308195 we are making a strong effort there and we are making that strong effort because we absolutely believe that virginia is in play

4308198 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4308199 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4308200 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4308201 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4308202 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem

4308206 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4308207 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4308208 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4308209 goodness me a barbecue for lunch in the middle of winter thats just crazy because its been so cold and we have even had snow and if its not snowing its raining and all the water has made a mess of the lawn although mind you it wouldnt be as bad if it hadnt been mown so short back in autumn but thats only because the guy who the fixed the mower set the blades too low even though i told him to please be careful not to but he didnt listen and then the thieving beggar had the cheek to charge me 120 dollars which is highway robbery because the damn motor doesnt even idle properly now and i have a good mind to ring up and complain but thats just the way tradesmen are these days and its all because of the labour government
4308210 were very confident in our ability to offer residents an effective school district
4308211 we are asking voters to approve that because honestly that is the only way we can improve our financial situation
4308212 this is a great school district we are determined we know we have mandates coming we recognize we are at a critical point financially we cannot continue to operate our district on 1998 money and pay 2008 bills

4308222 if you lost your job at a target store reportedly because you wrote on a wall it doesnt logically follow that you would drive 30 miles to the states democratic party headquarters and fatally shoot its chairman
4308223 indeed maybe there are no conclusions to be drawn from wednesdays fatal shooting in little rock other than that a disturbed gunman killed somebody and then was himself killed
4308224 still in this time of bitter politics you have to wonder was the murder of arkansas democratic party chairman bill gwatney by timothy dale johnson some kind of partisan hate crime

4308288 rush its over whats the big deal why stick with edwards
4308289 after covering john edwards and liking him for years what i thought i knew about him was wrong but reporters often misjudge candidates
4308290 five days after edwards flat lined on nightline i am still embarrassed by how badly i misjudged him both in print and in my personal feelings
4308291 without overstating these bonds i naively believed that i knew edwards as well as i understood anyone in the political center ring yet i never saw this sex scandal coming partly because i accepted the mythology that surrounded the edwardses marriage and partly because i assumed that any hint of a wandering eye would have come out during the 2004 campaign but then rielle hunter and the national enquirer brought us all into the real world
4308292 i do not want to dwell long on the specifics of this modern day no love story but even though some facts remain in dispute at every moment when judgment was called for edwards made the wrong choice my mistake about john edwards was believing all his public boasts about his nearly perfect marriage i allowed myself to judge him through the prism of his union with elizabeth when i would have reached a far different conclusion if i had gazed through the lens of his dalliance with rielle hunter
4308293 if there is a moral here other than the obvious truism about the danger of women who inspire jay mcinerney novels it is about the need for humility when writing about a candidates marriage his religious beliefs and other deeply personal matters there are things that reporters and readers simply cannot know for certain without empowering journalistic gumshoes to do bed checks
4308294 twenty first century americans are not for the most part sexual prudes as should be apparent from prime time tv shows polls and a persuasive array of anecdotal evidence but we have created a political culture in which marriages are on the ballot in november michelle obamas center stage role on the opening night of the democratic convention is emblematic of this buy one get one free trend that began with ronald and nancy reagan

4308310 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4308311 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4308312 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4308313 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

4308320 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4308321 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4308322 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4308323 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution

4308366 the dhb has responded to all queries from the ministry of health any delays will result in the dhb incurring additional costs
4308367 we started the process of re assessing the chamber and it became evident to us that continuing with a ceo was no longer appropriate so there was no point in delaying that step
4308368 the board is extremely talented and skilled and will actively support the chamber the chamber remains to be the independent voice of the business community in marlborough

4308372 we had to put in television monitors for the folks in the front row
4308373 the campaign really wanted to actually get the deck down lower so he would be more like at a town hall meeting setting

4308382 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
4308383 this book and books like it destroy our political culture undermine fair elections inhabit the slippery space between politics and slander
4308384 these books destroy civic debate on purpose and are fundamentally at odds with democracy
4308385 that is not just factually wrong it is wildly immoral whether or not corsi published lies is not even half the discussion we should be having
4308386 it is hard to conceive of an america in which journalists use their broadcast power to protect our civic culture rather than promote shadowy figures who seek to destroy it but imagining it is the first step
4308387 cuando hay estos comit s casi nunca surgen problemas y los partidos deber an hacer lo mismo

4308394 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4308395 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4308396 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4308397 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4308398 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4308399 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4308400 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4308401 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4308402 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4308403 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4308404 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4308405 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4308406 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4308407 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4308408 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government
4308409 i pay homage to those tortured years ago to those persecuted and those who suffered unjustly in prison
4308410 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4308411 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4308412 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community
4308413 our fathers have left behind for us no formula of concord which authentically interprets the word of god but only confessions of which more than one begins with the admitted reservation of further and better insight
4308414 we narrow things down and search quickly being able to have the three dogs is important one of my goals was to have enough dogs to be able to search all the schools
4308415 dekalb county is very fortunate in the fact we have obtained three new weapons to combat drugs
4308416 we are well blessed in dekalb county with the drug dealers and drug users well blessed
4308417 there is no way one dog can check a school by himself
4308418 this way youre letting one rest all the time while you are still checking the schools superintendent charles warren is real supportive of this and students knowing we have these dogs is going to deter a lot of things
4308419 barangsiapa yang tidak niat untuk melakukan puasa sebelum fajar maka tidak ada puasa baginya
4308420 barangsiapa tidak niat untuk melakukan puasa pada malam harinya maka tidak ada puasa baginya
4308421 apakah engkau punya santapan siang maka jika tidak ada aku akan berpuasa
4308422 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah memerintahkan puasa asyura maka ketika diwajibkan puasa ramadhan maka bagi yang mau puasa asyura diperbolehkan dan yang mau berbuka dipersilahkan
4308423 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menyuruh seorang dari bani aslam untuk mengumumkan kepada manusia bahwasanya barangsiapa yang sudah makan hendaklah puasa sampai maghrib dan barangsiapa yang belum makan teruskanlah berpuasa karena hari ini adalah hari asyura
4308424 ketika turun kewajiban puasa ramadhan maka ramadhanlah yang wajib dan ditinggalkanlah asyura berartti puasa asyura tidak wajib lagi hukumnya pent
4308425 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4308426 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4308427 dahulu sahabat nabi shalallahu alaihi wa sallam jika salah seorang diantara mereka puasa dan tiba waktu berbuka tetapi tertidur sebelum berbuka tidak diperbolehkan makan malam dan siangnya hingga sore hari lagi
4308428 dihalalkan bagimu pada malam hari bulan puasa bercampur berjima dengan isteri isterimu
4308429 dan makan minumlah sehingga terang kepadamu benang putih dari benang hitam yaitu fajar
4308430 kami mendengar dan kami taat wahai rabb kami ampunilah dosa kami dan kepada mu lah kami kembali
4308431 sehingga terang kepadamu benang putih dari benang hitam yaitu fajar
4308432 makan dan minumlah hingga jelas bagi kalian benang putih dari benang hitam
4308433 fajar itu ada dua yang pertama tidak mengharamkan makan bagi yang puasa tidak halal shalat ketika itu yang kedua mengharamkan makan dan telah dibolehkan shalat ketika terbit fajar tersebut
4308434 janganlah kalian tertipu oleh adzannya bilal dan jangan pula tertipu oleh warna putih yang memancar ke atas sampai melintang
4308435 makan dan minumlah jangan kalian tertipu oleh fajar yang memancar ke atas makan dan minumlah sampai warna merang membentang
4308436 hingga jelas bagi kalian benang putih dari benang hitam yaitu fajar
4308437 jika salah seorang dari kalian mendengar adzan padahal gelas ada di tangannya janganlah ia letakkan hingga memenuhi hajatnya
4308438 ini dimungkinkan bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwasanya muadzin adzan sebelum terbit fajar
4308439 telah dikumandangkan iqamah shalat ketika itu di tangan umar masih ada gelas dia berkata boleh aku meminumnya ya rasulullah
4308440 termasuk perbuatan bidah yang mungkar adalah yang diada adakan pada zaman ini yaitu mengumandangkan adzan kedua sepertiga jam sebelum waktunya di bulan ramadhan serta memadamkan lampu lampu yang dijadikan sebagai tanda telah haramnya makan dan minum bagi orang yang mau puasa mereka mengaku perbuatan ini dalam rangka ikhtiyath hati hati dalam ibadah tidak ada yang mengetahuinya kecuali beberapa gelintir manusia saja hal ini telah menyeret mereka hingga melakukan adzan ketika telah terbenam matahari beberapa derajat untuk meyakinkan telah masuknya waktu itu sangkaan mereka mereka mengakhirkan berbuka dan menyegerakan sahur hingga menyelisihi sunnah oleh karena itu sedikit pada mereka kebaikan dan banyak tersebar kejahatan pada mereka allahul mustaan
4308441 jika malam datang dari sini siang menghilang dari sini dan terbenam matahari telah berbukalah orang yang puasa
4308442 kami pernah bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dalam suatu safar perjalanan ketika itu kami sedang berpuasa di bulan ramadhan
4308443 wahai fulan dalam riwayat abu daud wahai bilal berdirilah ambilkan kami air
4308444 kalau kalian melihatnya niscaya akan kalian lihat dari atas onta yakni matahari
4308445 jika kalian melihat malam telah datang dari sini maka telah berbuka orang yang puasa
4308446 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengajari shalat dan puasa beliau berkata
4308447 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4308448 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak

4308458 one of the more sympathetic figures on the national stage
4308459 a lot of different things will be argued about this case from both sides but the one thing we do know for sure thats not arguable is the fact that he signed this deal indicating that this company was free and clear of lawsuits and then midway through the case we find out he was mired in a major lawsuit over the assets of the company we would never have moved forward with this deal knowing what we know today
4308460 we had high hopes for the both the relationship and the technology provided by xflix llc however the assets and services failed us time and time again which is why we had to move away from their platform and onto our own proprietary one

4308464 tony blair granted him something of the power that walter bagehot ascribed to a constitutional monarch the right to be consulted the right to advise and the right to warn
4308465 since 1997 republicans have received only a slight majority 56 percent of the 4 76 million in campaign donations from the murdoch family and the news corporations political action committees and employees since democrats won control of congress in the 2006 elections the company and its employees have given more than twice as much to democrats as to republicans
4308466 some aspects of news corps programming positions and alliances serve conservative political ends and others do not but all are consistent with the use of political influence for corporate advantage

4308504 theres a lot of potential for bulk wine because of the bulk harvest
4308505 in recent years exports of bulk wine from new zealand have been around 4 5 percent of total exports
4308506 after a good vintage a winery may have a bit more wine than it can sell so it will go into bulk wholesale between wineries
4308507 there was a lot of debate in the early 1990s that bulk would be bad for the industry but evidence to date is sales of those products has not damaged the reputation of the industry
4308508 what it has done is expose different drinkers to our sauvignon blanc
4308509 in terms of bulk wine trade compared to prices a year ago yes its cheap but bulk imports to new zealand have been as low as 50c to 60c litre

4308523 first of all this seeming to respond asymmetrically is a myth thats just not borne out by the facts
4308524 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for exmple ryan howard is from st louis and st louis it seems like they support their team theyre out there encouraging in philly cant be no punk
4308525 because of the expressed support by malaca ang and the statements coming out from the proponents in the house of representatives a lot of slippery and winding roads loom ahead that pose danger to the charter change move
4308526 the previous negative reception to the idea of charter change
4308527 put the issue to extensive public consultation and debate so that the public may be informed on the nature of this latest move to amend the charter

4308552 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today

4308840 teacher i brought my son so you could heal him he is possessed by an evil spirit that wont let him talk 18 and whenever this spirit seizes him it throws him violently to the ground then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid d so i asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit but they couldnt do it
4308841 you faithless people how long must i be with you how long must i put up with you bring the boy to me
4308842 since he was a little boy 22 the spirit often throws him into the fire or into water trying to kill him have mercy on us and help us if you can
4308843 chantelle what do you mean if i can restore you what do you mean if i can heal you what do you mean if youre gonna make it
4308844 what do you mean if im going to follow through on the purposes and plans ive laid out for your life from the foundations of the earth
4308845 because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
4308846 father when i did believe you it didnt turn out the way i thought it would
4308847 father i have done nothing but good to this person and yet i dont have favor in the situation
4308848 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4308849 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4308850 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4308851 our sympathies go to the families of those that have been lost and seriously injured
4308852 there are cases we choose to settle for less than all of the claims
4308853 its a recognition that life is short and rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end
4308854 she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society
4308855 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4308856 if we make a difference in one soldiers life and possibly that of his or her children we have been successful but to impact so many soldiers and families is simply overwhelming and fills the heart with pride
4308857 this program has grown so large for us that nearly everyone feels the positive influence of this family interaction
4308858 i cannot be more proud of our ministry team and the positive impact they have had on our daily mission
4308859 its a wonderful blessing to be able read to my daughter on video receive a video in return and be able to watch her sit and follow along with the book
4308860 it helps with the separation and i get to help teach her to read at the same time
4308861 many soldiers do not have the time to come to our reading room so we take our video camera and books to them
4308862 the main idea for this program is simply to keep soldiers in touch with their families the greatest reward however is the knowledge that someone back home will cry smile or laugh as they see their loved one in living color live before them on tv
4308863 military showers of appreciation assists active duty military families from all branches that are expecting new babies with various items they will need to care for their new baby
4308864 because many of these pregnant mothers have babies alone with new fathers deployed we pay special attention to pampering these spouses and supporting them positively during this time
4308865 this shower shed a little sunlight on a difficult time that many military spouses experience during constant deployments
4308866 many people do not realize the sacrifices the entire military family makes during a deployment it is important to the north star group that military families know they are appreciated and that they are not alone
4308867 everything from baby bottles to a bassinet the gifts helped us out a lot the entire event was just a very supportive caring atmosphere i really enjoyed it the baby shower also provided me an opportunity to meet and make new friends with other pregnant military moms
4308868 we will make every attempt to do something special for expecting families even if they miss the shower cut off dates
4308869 these quarterly showers are currently held at camp pendleton and twentynine palms california base locations with plans of expanding to bases in other states in the future all military servicemembers in california willing to travel to the shower from any military bases in the area are welcome to apply

4308872 reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could or did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient to ground the exercise of personal jurisdiction
4308873 were very concerned about the standard this case sets on jurisdiction
4308874 the court said that even if they could foresee the attacks that wasnt enough thats a very tough standard
4308875 obviously this is a welcome ruling they upheld the district court on every point except the ones they didnt have to reach
4308876 my clients have felt from the beginning offended that they would be accused of knowingly assisting osama bin laden they stripped him of his citizenship kicked him out of the country and seized his assets over 10 years ago i know there may be a petition for certiorari to the supreme court but this is a big step toward the successful conclusion of the case
4308877 to characterize plaintiffs claims expressly predicated on a state sponsored terrorist act as sounding in tort
4308878 because the defendants specific alleged conduct supporting muslim charities that promote and underwrite terrorism is not conduct in trade traffic or commerce
4308879 an individual of a foreign state acting in his official capacity is the agency or instrumentality of the state and thereby protected
4308880 an agency is any thing or person through which action is accomplished
4308881 it is easily open enough to include senior members of a foreign states government and secretariat
4308882 the act of state doctrine precludes our courts from sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory including acts committed by individual officers of foreign governments
4308883 it was created for a national purpose channeling humanitarian aid to bosnia muslims the kingdom actively supervises it
4308884 we decline to read the statute in a way that would deprive the terrorism exception or its limitations of meaning
4308885 did not delegate to victims their counsel and the courts the responsibility of the executive branch to make americas foreign policy response to acts of terrorism committed by a foreign state including whether federal courts may entertain a victims claim for damages
4308886 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4308887 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4308888 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4308889 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4308890 i dont blame you hiring a coach etc therapist copywriter trainer consultant can be a big decision can you share with me what specific aspect of my services you are concerned about
4308891 yes i can see how this can be a big decision you know i found that typically my clients are initially concerned with one of the three things is the problem important enough to solve it now is this the right solution for your situation can you afford the solution which one of those concerns you the most
4308892 hmmm i see let me ask you lets say we get started on this project what are the downsides
4308893 great what kinds of questions do you think they might they ask
4308894 good idea i always discuss decisions like this with my partner or spouse but let me ask you a question what will you do when your partner doesnt like the idea of us moving forward with this
4308895 yes its a sold investment i tell you what i know this is only worthwhile if you produce solid results right whats the one result you would want to be absolutely sure we could produce in the next month months six days 90 that would have you really happy you hired me great why dont we make this our top priority and get started right away
4308896 not really how does this price compare to what its costing you to do nothing about this problem
4308897 hmmmm how long have you been dealing with this issue if you havent solved it on your own so far what makes you think you can do it now
4308898 yes i suppose you could but let me ask you something when was the last time you saw heard of a heart surgeon performing an open heart surgery on himself
4308899 with all the respect i must disagree if you thought you could solve this problem on your own we wouldnt be talking right now tell me how would things be different if you could rely on an unbiased opinion to give you a fresh perspective of this problem
4308900 yes it will take some time to address this issue how much more time per week could you devote to other revenue generating activities if you could eliminate dealing with this problem on ongoing bases
4308901 thats funny you just told me it takes you 10 hours a week to deal with this problem wouldnt it make sense to hire someone like myself and solve it so that you can use your time on more productive tasks
4308902 wow if you are that busy and you are still not getting the results you want perhaps it would make sense to start the project by helping you better prioritize your activities and leverage your time more effectively
4308903 today i was supposed to be getting a medal for my grandfather
4308904 i guarantee if he was still alive i would call him and tell him what happened today and he would probably say well i won my bowling tournament whether he did it or not i think about that he wanted me to know one of us was winning so i still owe him
4308905 i just came out and tried to work a few things and it worked out
4308906 hes gotten a whole lot better i think even bigger and stronger his wrist is like the size of vcr tapes
4308907 a lot of honor is in your heart when youre wrestling in front of your people you want to give them a medal because sometimes there are people out there who deserve it more than you my hats off to him thats a tough loss for him and his home crowd he brought it he was really trying hard i was just able to hold him off
4308908 he came out real fast so i was ready for it
4308909 i got out there and saw that he was feeling it just as much as i was and my offense wasnt working for me in the end like when i really needed to i tried to hit that gut wrench as many times as i could and it didnt pan out
4308910 thats my go to move and it wasnt there for me
4308911 my lift i wasnt able to get off on him hindsight is always 20 20 looking back i know for a fact i should have been doing a whole lot more on my feet
4308912 i already know coach army staff sgt shon lewis is going to say that right off the top
4308913 i missed a couple of key opportunities to score on my feet and ill never get em back and this is not the place where you should walk around saying anything like that
4308914 in competitions like this youre looking to see your soul out there gasping on the mat for air and it didnt happen today
4308915 i walked off i wasnt tired i was like man if im not tired then i didnt do everything i shouldve done
4308916 usually we say you get back to the hotel room and your mirror will be the most honest thing youll ever see
4308917 i dont even have to make it that far to know i dropped the ball today and i apologize to anybody i let down theres more fight in me theres a whole lot more fight in me and im going to have to make sure thats shown the next competitions the next major ones the next olympics
4308918 if these rules were something that started last week i would probably have a whole lot to say about it but ive won some matches the same way
4308919 its something we know its an occupational hazard i guess but we accept it the way it is
4308920 greco roman wrestling regardless of the rules and what changes they make when it boils down its wrestling
4308921 and if you dont go out there and wrestle head down then you get no anthem no flag thats the way it is
4308922 theres something in us that makes us keep going it might be just drive determination american spirit me and my background soldiering i dont know but theres just something in here that says its never time to quit weve got something we can accomplish here so were going to hit it hard these next four years and do everything we have to do
4308923 honestly its a lot smaller tournament than what i thought
4308924 and i couldve brought a whole lot bigger fight im kicking myself for that
4308925 i think there was times when i was holding back
4308926 i always joke that i can outrun anybody on a treadmill i dont have to think when im on a treadmill but if im outside running i forget what im doing but on the treadmill im a heavyweight king running a marathon sometimes it happens in wrestling ill be out there and my mind will wander
4308927 people are very friendly architecture is amazing the great wall experience was awesome
4308928 you cant put a cap on the fight in an americans heart
4308929 were just craving another chance now this is just fuel for something bigger and the only thing bigger is the next olympics
4308930 i might make it home and get some of mommas cooking
4308931 it lifts your heart to hear these children playing and having so much fun after such a sad start in life their mother is a miracle worker
4308932 i served four years in germany vietnam and key west fla and was with missile outfits everywhere except vietnam after i left the military i spent 29 years working for procter amp gamble and am now retired and living in north carolina i retired early and was lucky now i am living my second childhood and playing golf every day
4308933 i was pretty overwhelmed i can honestly say it was a dream of mine but i also knew there were a lot of people who were probably more qualified than i it was not something i was expecting maybe years later but i was overwhelmed to find out i was inducted it brought tears to my eyes
4308934 i have a couple one of the greatest i have is coming back from losing to michigan state in the ncaa soccer semifinals on a friday we had lost to michigan state on a thursday and it was a great event playing in the ncaa final four we headed home on friday and saturday night when the puck was dropped against princeton i was on the ice it still gives me chills to think that coach jack riley even though i only skated on weekends because of soccer practice put me on the ice when the puck dropped in the first game of my yearling year i was on the ice two days after losing to michigan state that was a memorable moment in hockey in baseball i will never forget hitting the ball very very hard in all of my at bats at navy we beat navy my junior year but i will never forget getting back on the bus and i was being voted team captain and playing in three final fours with joe casey who i consider to be the best soccer player in army history as my captain
4308935 i was recruited to play hockey and my objective was to graduate and play sports so my life was all about sports
4308936 in my mind as much as anything it validates the quality of the teams i played on in that era three ncaa final fours two eastern intercollegiate baseball championships and three pretty successful hockey teams even though we didnt make it to the ncaa tournament to me its a validation of the teams i played on and my teammates
4308937 my family my dad and three brothers and sister my dad was so supportive i listened to others who had demanding fathers my dad loved sports and was so supportive from the time i started playing i had three older brothers and they bought me gloves skates sticks and introduced me to the sports my little sister was my teammate in the neighborhood i had three great coaches all hall of famers and not just at west point eric tipton in baseball jack riley in hockey and of course joe palone in soccer i had great teammates too when it was all said and done my dad brothers and sister were so influential and supportive
4308938 the cadets seem to have a lot more freedom and the curriculum changed in terms of being able to select majors and things like that its a different place and i will say its probably a better place id like to think the people who make the changes are graduates themselves and the changes that have been made are positive
4308939 no more waiting for buses looking for teammates collecting money from other team members or having to swap out team members
4308940 all 10k runners will start the race at the same time the winning team will be determined by collective fastest times of team members
4308941 situations like this reinforce my global view of the important mission this unit provides to our global partners
4308942 ive seen our airmen do some amazing things in a very short time we routinely train for this type of situation and its a great privilege to possess the ability to aid a regional partner during a crisis
4308943 our primary goal for international pilot training is to build a foundation that will enable us all to carry out operations as coalition partners
4308944 and this wing has the people equipment and experience to do just that
4308945 over the last 19 years the wing has trained more than 750 pilots from 23 of the 24 nations that fly the f 16 its a mission we know very well
4308946 enhancing the air capabilities of other nations is what we do and as senior leaders often point out its an undertaking of the utmost significance in our post cold war environment
4308947 what the last 25 years have shown is that the threats can emerge almost anywhere in the world but our own forces and resources will remain finite
4308948 to fill this gap we must help our allies and partners to confront extremists and other potential sources of global instability within their borders
4308949 by the time an initial student pilot arrives in tucson he already has his pilot wings and hes graduated from the defense language institute so we can be sure he knows how to fly and how to communicate in english
4308950 our job is to start the student out in the f 16 from square one
4308951 first and foremost the 162nd has a tremendous safety record because our maintenance personnel here average 18 years of experience specializing on the f 16
4308952 there are very few places in the world with this kind of airspace for military training
4308953 finally we average 17 000 flying hours per year and were able to do that because of arizonas year round good weather less than 3 percent of scheduled sorties here are canceled due to weather thats practically unheard of in other parts of the world
4308954 the students get the best possible flight education when they come here
4308955 our pilots average 10 years of instructor time and 2 300 flying hours in the f 16
4308956 on its most basic level its about flying together operating together and training together so if we have to we can fight together
4308957 on a deeper level its about friendships with more than 4 000 f 16s in operation around the world creating the foundation of a relationship is absolutely invaluable
4308958 some countries dont have enough need for airlift to purchase their own c 17s
4308959 with a full payload the c 17 can go a distance of 2 400 nautical miles and fly at an altitude of up to 28 000 feet
4308960 it can convert to airline or cargo seats it can handle a combination of passengers vehicles track vehicles cargo medical evacuations hummers fire trucks helicopters an abrams tank up to 75 metric tons and can land on short austere landing zones
4308961 initially there will only be u s personnel manning the c 17s
4308962 but with training the countries will be able to use their own pilots and loadmasters it will take a year and a half to train the countrys crew and for them to be comfortable with the c 17 to fly on their own
4308963 we have the legacy we have the present and were also talking about the future
4308964 a lot of questions we get is whats the difference between the air national guard and the air force reserve and the active duty and air national guard
4308965 a lot of times were known as the hometown air force we have deep ties with the community
4308966 today its awareness with the public to show them all aspects of the air force since it is a total force and to bring that awareness that were all interwoven we all have the same rank structure the same type of training ones just more of a part time component as opposed to a full time component
4308967 since its air force week the kids said we have to go to the air and space museum and here we are
4308968 i think its a neat insight to air force operations since were navy and we live the navy life to be stationed here and get to see it in further detail is great
4308969 we get to mix in with the kids and the crowds and they get to see what we do on a daily basis
4308970 i love being out here letting the people come through and see what the medical field is all about in the air force
4308971 we wanted to make sure people see our equipment and understand our capabilities
4308972 people pretty much understand this is just a big shower we use to get people clean before we treat them
4308973 i think the kids have enjoyed seeing a different side of the military
4308974 its a non threatening environment considering what the military is all about
4308975 we must be conscious that there is a war on the roadways of the entire world where everyday hundreds of people die for many different reasons immediate intervention is needed to reduce the number of victims because it is becoming a real destruction it will not be easy but it is a challenge that should be faced with great determination
4308976 one day will be devoted to each of the four sub sectors for which guidance is needed the first day will be dedicated to road users truckers automobile drivers those who travel by train and all who work in transportation related services the second to women on the streets the third to children on the streets and the fourth to the homeless
4308977 the most important thing to keep in mind is that the church is committed to raising awareness and helping people who use the road to gain a sense of responsibility to decrease traffic accidents the contribution of the christian community is necessary but in addition to the church schools families and institutions must also work to further this cause and work to create respect for applicable laws
4308978 the scary statistics we hear on the television and read in the daily newspapers that demonstrate a lack of respect for life that is why we have called this summit in october in bogot to look for a way to confront the problem it will begin with the continental conference and will later focus on the parish and diocesan environments another important topic tied to the street is that of children being forced to beg or rummage through garbage
4308979 they tell me about their joys but also their worries their family problems and those at work the hopes which they carry in their heart and the anguish and uncertainties which humanity is living this moment
4308980 he who prays never loses hope even when he finds himself in difficult situations
4308981 i am ready for everything jesus is here among us i have been able to pray well and have said with all my heart ave crux spes unica
4308982 30 year history of advocating and acting in support of legalized abortion
4308983 there are many goods you are trying to weigh where you have someone in public life who is not living in their public responsibilities consistent with the catholic faith i think you are concerned about that individual
4308984 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was
4308985 i think you have concern for that individual and in wanting to try to bring about enlightenment and conversion you also have a concern for the rest of your people thats the problem with the individual thats in a public position when they act contradictory to their faith then it can create within the church what the church means by scandal which means leading others into error
4308986 frankly after the pastoral action i did take with the governor
4308987 there were several people who communicated with me that we didnt realize how extreme she was
4308988 i also am concerned about young catholics that are thinking about public service and public life
4308989 they cant go the road of these so called pro choice catholic politicians and really be faithful to your faith
4308990 to my mind you have to pursue it in that way you have to attempt to meet with the individual instruct the individual make sure that youve given them every chance to consider their position before you take extreme action
4308991 to my knowledge she hasnt gone to communion since this second request to her so in that sense from an indirect way shes honoring the request
4308992 she has not communicated with me at this point at all and shes told other people in the media that shes going to respond to me personally but that hasnt happened at this time
4308993 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics
4308994 but i hope that it alerted senator obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the church on this very critical and important area
4308995 so i think it would be a bad judgment on senator obamas part to select someone who was in conflict with the church
4308996 we can have a serious impact on the positions that the individuals and parties are taking
4308997 if were just taking care of gods children until he wants them back then after spending 13 years with ben i know why he wanted him back
4308998 he was a special person a good boy so theres no doubt hes in heaven
4308999 we are just grateful that we had him for 13 years
4309000 it still feels like hes going to walk in the door
4309001 i dont know how people could do this without god
4309002 without our faith id feel like i was jumping off a 50 story building and nobodys catching me with faith i feel like theres this net every day i slip a little but it just kind of bounces you back up and keeps you right where youre supposed to be
4309003 through the whole thing i just kept saying i would know i would know in my heart if ben was gone
4309004 i dont think we got scared until they got to the third list of names and bens name wasnt on it
4309005 i told them they didnt fail at bringing him back he just wasnt coming back he was already in heaven his soul just soared as fast as it could
4309006 it was a tornado nobody took him from us its just something that happened
4309007 how can we be angry about our child being in heaven
4309008 there was nothing to look back on and say we wish we wouldve done this or we wish we wouldve done that
4309009 they handed over a rather significant volume of information concerning membership and the programs that they run
4309010 we are fully in agreement with what the archbishop has asked us to do
4309011 a fascinating examination of gods sovereignty and human free will
4309012 what does it mean to submit your physical bodies to gods sovereign care
4309013 for me using hormonal birth control indicates that i dont really trust god with every area of my life
4309014 it is an effort on my part to control something that i really believe god can be trusted with
4309015 shown that we had a lot to learn about nfp and that there is a dark side we werent aware of
4309016 i feel like it really works in harmony with the way that god designed our bodies to work
4309017 in contrast with the pill which works by altering and suppressing our natural systems nfp works by supporting those systems in harmony with their functions it goes with the flow so to speak there is a wisdom and a rightness to that which i really appreciate
4309018 crazy or irresponsible to consider not being on the pill
4309019 my guess is that most churches are not talking about sexuality
4309020 these discussions between the roman catholic church and the anglican communion have been going on for 42 years
4309021 we would like to bring these down to the local level
4309022 they make it clear that they no longer believe there is truth in the anglican communion and the only way they can find truth is reunion with rome
4309023 as an organization of lay men that has a strong history and commitment to life we think it is very important to highlight the issues faced by those fathers whose children are aborted
4309024 there are three victims of every abortion the child and both of his or her parents and it is our hope that this conference will be the beginning of a ministry within the church to these fathers who grieve the death of their unborn child in isolation and silence
4309025 voter guides are a way to empower voters to make well informed choices on election day pro life americans want to get beyond the spin and know the truth based on the record about where the candidates stand
4309026 pro life voters are a key constituency that both democrats and republicans ignore at their peril americans united for life is looking forward to helping pro life americans across the country vote their values in this election
4309027 is the last chance for peaceful change in ecuador for democratic and constitutional change and yet there are some who want to keep us in the past
4309028 let them catechize 6 or 7 year olds because we should reflect on this and not have to put up with sermons or instructions from anybody
4309029 we need to say yes to the future without being afraid and without the old fear of the clergy or the vengeance of the devil
4309030 who is lying and who is telling the truth who wants to move the country forward and who wants to leave it in the darkness in which it has always existed think about it and dont let them teach you
4309031 those arrogant people who want to give us orders instructions catechesis have the answer they deserve
4309032 several topics of general interest were discussed such as the popular initiative against abortion and the upcoming elections but no agreement or formality was established
4309033 in 1936 anti catholic militias of the spanish civil war during the government of manuel azana trapped brother marcos vergara knowing that they were going to kill him he came up with an idea and gave a pen he had in his shirt to his captor
4309034 moved by the gesture the soldier let him escape and kept the fancy pen for himself
4309035 began to flee and upon returning to colombia he learned that his seven companions who were between the ages of 23 and 29 had been massacred in the name of christ
4309036 he did not fall with them because he was in another city in malaga working with victims of the christian persecution the others were carrying out their labors in the ciempozuelos mental hospital near madrid where they were finally surrounded
4309037 as a survivor of a war that left more than 7 000 bishops priests and religious dead years later he became the head of his community and the director of the san rafael clinic he died 19 years ago and his testimony until now unknown has reappeared in a book that brother clemente lopez of the same order is seeking to publish
4309038 as a technology partner to physicians and payers we are committed to developing innovative clinical it solutions that improve patient safety increase workflow efficiency and reduce costs
4309039 david brings to prematics executive team deep experience managing the development of successful clinical it solutions that reaffirms our companys vision and promise
4309040 prematics has designed an incredible network platform that has the power to drive strong adoption and continued utilization of clinical it solutions within the physician practice by making it easy to automate common clinical processes such as prescribing
4309041 i look forward to leading the development of new solutions that leverage this critical foundation to further improve utilization of clinical it solutions in the practice setting
4309042 if done properly overall behavioral targeted advertising could prove quite valuable to consumers and could dramatically improve their online experiences while at the same time protecting their privacy

4309045 receiving reaccreditation further solidifies the air forces museum as one of national prominence and prestige
4309046 the commitment of the board staff volunteers and foundation to uphold the highest standards of the museum practice is shown with this award
4309047 no more waiting for buses looking for teammates collecting money from other team members or having to swap out team members
4309048 all 10k runners will start the race at the same time the winning team will be determined by collective fastest times of team members
4309049 they are very excited this is a capability that they dont have
4309050 they cant wait to give this a test run and hopefully it can save some lives and make their jobs a bit easier
4309051 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
4309052 man i didnt think it would take such a fast time to make it back for semis or finals
4309053 holy crap he can kick the skin off the ball

4309057 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames

4309086 i love this episode its hilarious and a really original idea i love when greg asks nick where his car is
4309087 and the forementioned car was stolen from a parking lot filled with police cars
4309088 last nights new epi was a lot of fun wasnt it
4309089 it doesnt mean policies are discarded some will be reconfirmed but all policies are being assessed they will be either reinstated or adjusted
4309090 rabi siapakah yang berbuat dosa orang ini sendiri atau orang tuanya sehingga ia dilahirkan buta
4309091 bukan dia dan bukan juga orang tuanya tetapi karena pekerjaan pekerjaan allah harus dinyatakan di dalam dia 9 4 kita harus mengerjakan pekerjaan dia yang mengutus aku selama masih siang akan datang malam di mana tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat bekerja 9 5 selama aku di dalam dunia akulah terang dunia

4309093 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective
4309094 you are mourning the loss of what is not real god is not ripping the carpet from under you he is easing you gently into what you truly want who you truly are only joy is present for those who choose with god
4309095 so forgiveness is not forgiveness of errors it is recognizing that the truth of us
4309096 we are equal we are spirit if anything other than love and peace is between us it is from our egos
4309097 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4309098 you dont have much time five minutes hes just riding his bike up there and back you better leap to it

4309100 belum ada yang pasti tapi kami terbuka untuk kemungkinan itu indonesia merupakan salah satu negara yang kami lihat
4309101 saat ini e mail adalah komunikasi dasar pengguna internet pada akhirnya semua orang akan menggunakan situs jejaring sosial dan bahkan bisa menggantikan e mail sebagai cara dasar berkomunikasi
4309102 tahun ini kami melihat perkembangan yang sangat tajam kenaikan spam mencapai 280 persen
4309103 hal itu membuat indonesia masuk ke dalam priority watch list nya ustr united states trade representative sejak 2001 sampai 2006
4309104 sehingga sekarang indonesia naik peringkat di mata ustr dengan hanya menjadi watch list
4309105 kedubes rusia he alexander a ivanov akan menghadiri acara pelepasan simbolik dan pemberian penghargaan kepada lima pemuda bangsa
4309106 mereka terpilih mewakili indonesia karena prestasi gemilang mereka menjuarai kompetisi sains dan matematika tingkat nasional dan internasional
4309107 kelima pemuda bangsa ini akan mendapatkan kesempatan seumur hidup untuk menyaksikan peluncuran satelit ini dan akan mengunjungi beberapa tempat menarik di rusia seperti star city tempat legendaris pelatihan astronot di rusia
4309108 i have my list of things that you all gave me to do and i just want to let you know some of the things that have been completed
4309109 council members danny douglas wilhelmina johnson and anne warr all sat right here and said they didnt want to tear up that runway
4309110 then they went in there monday to that council meeting and voted to tear it up they sat right up in here and lied so you tell me what kind of people do we have in there
4309111 from that meeting we concluded along with what i thought was the commission that we needed to go ahead with tearing up runway 34
4309112 if you vote against the commissions recommendations well stick by the decision
4309113 but at least show us the courtesy of listening to what we have to say
4309114 if the very first recommendations we make arent even heard or considered it kind of thwarts our enthusiasm what are we here for i could be at home playing with my grandchildren
4309115 i think this has been a real bone of contention and i think things will calm down now
4309116 i think there was a bit of confusion and i think if we can get over this then council will gladly accept any of the commissions recommendations
4309117 so now i guess we need to figure out where we go from there and see if there is a point to having a commission
4309118 we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4309119 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tentpole release for midsummer
4309120 summer season is an ideal window for a family tentpole release
4309121 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4309122 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4309123 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4309124 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4309125 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4309126 our focus on environmental restoration and infrastructure construction has provided a foundation to provide increased value to our client and its recycling programs in tennessee
4309127 these projects are integral to our growth strategy as they help us establish a foothold in the infrastructure construction business
4309128 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4309129 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the ceasefire agreement to be honoured
4309130 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks
4309131 thats the sichuan cats you need to win tough competitions to volunteer at beijing

4309140 fundamental contribution by italian troops in restoring the ardennes front after the german offensive
4309141 instead the usual semi articulate conspiracy which aims to saddle

4309143 anything hitler was blamed for was a way for german generals to wash their memories
4309144 i know it seems its a pet peeve of yours that italians are equated with lousy soldiers running at the first sight of a tommy but i think most of us in here know differently
4309145 italy in wwii had some elite units that were not
4309146 i know it seems its a pet peeve of yours that italians are gt equated with lousy soldiers running at the first sight of a tommy but i gt think most of us in here know differently

4309150 i know it seems its a pet peeve of yours that italians are equated with lousy soldiers running at the first sight of a tommy but i think most of us in here know differently
4309151 i resent the a380s aviation historical pretensions most of which pertain to its size the pane is enormous yes but revolutionary it is not when the 747 debuted in 1970 it was more than double the size of any existing competitor and its economies of scale changed air travel forever the airbus is only about 30 percent larger than a 747 overall and in some configurations will carry fewer passengers then we have jets glaring physical shortcomings the 747 is one of the most elegant icons of industrial design dignified in the fashion of a grand ocean liner the a380 is big for the sake of big a steroidal beluga with a malformed forehead the fact that virtually all overseas carriers from air canada to ethiopian airlines outclass their u s counterparts is something many americans still fail to grasp that maybe is one reason these a380 puff pieces have so much traction full flat sleeper cubicles in business class wide screen personal video in coach a gleaming airport singapores changi with a complimentary movie theater and swimming pool it all seems so decadent so unlikely so foreign that being said i believe that two recent announcements rank as perhaps the most impressive efforts by any u s contender in recent memory
4309152 its been a long while since ive had a round with no bogeys
4309153 i had plenty of them last week thats for sure
4309154 its always nice to get one early in a tournament
4309155 i only slept two hours so it was tough to get up early in the morning
4309156 but im very pleased it was tough out there today with the wind
4309157 you have a loft with a great view of the airport
4309158 hi my name is emma want to be my friend
4309159 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4309160 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4309161 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4309162 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4309163 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government
4309164 i pay homage to those tortured years ago to those persecuted and those who suffered unjustly in prison
4309165 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4309166 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4309167 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community
4309168 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
4309169 if you have a green party i want to join
4309170 these imply the financial outcomes ie cost savings from the it transformation remain on track
4309171 the upgrade is a salient reminder of the age old telecoms equation growth in network volumes means capacity investment required
4309172 in telstras case it is comforting to see the company converting the strong data volumes into robust sales growth
4309173 the transformation spend may be indicative of some overspend delay in the transformation program while the increase in the business as usual capex is indicative of the aggressive capex sales expectations management had set
4309174 due to choppy market conditions and regulatory risks still on the horizon
4309175 agu ntese hasta el verano dijo un viejito cuyano y en agosto se muri nosotros estamos vivos despu s de haber compartido el olvido y la traici n
4309176 as i told you after my first match im just looking to find my rhythm which i found tonight
4309177 i was happy to not spend too much time on the court
4309178 my arm gets really tired and i cant practise as much
4309179 i played some balls deep into the corners and down the middle and she didnt have a chance to step up and play her game
4309180 in the first set she made a lot of unforced errors
4309181 i think we both were a little nervous i dont think we both played our best in the second set she was more aggressive and played a lot of long points when i was down 3 0 and 4 1 it was only one break so i didnt panic because i knew with one break im back in it
4309182 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4309183 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4309184 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4309185 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4309186 we dont want to see something like this torn down if theres anything we can do to save it
4309187 if they get rid of this right here that will take away 20 percent of business on parsons avenue
4309188 okay evan now that youve sliced the melon pieces into perfect triangles of a uniform width and height you can place the tips on the points each 72 degrees from its neighbors that i laser etched in the dish
4309189 if you can make it through the training camp the hard part is done
4309190 so its kind of like why make it through training camp and stop now you made it through the hard part the fun part is about to start im looking forward to that and hopefully being a part of the turnaround that we can have this year
4309191 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the offseason
4309192 but hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4309193 im finally putting everything together as far as what they want and how they want it to be done
4309194 now i can start adding my twist to it and going out and playing football
4309195 yo se quien le puede gustar a chito m nica tello

4309275 love is not about romance or passion love is about a state of grace you experience it when you accept the absolute truth of the other person both the cruel and the divine and they accept these things in you and you find that you still long to share a life with them to know the worst in another and still want them with all your soul to know that they feel the same it is a sense of security and power and once you have arrived at this the richness of romance and passion that appears is not blinding instead it is invulnerable and forever
4309276 single guys rejoice a new 30 year study from michigan state university released monday suggests that never married men are quickly becoming as healthy as their married counterparts however marriage is still meaningful the authors said as widowers reported themselves in poorer health than husbands the gap widened every year msu author hui liu assistant professor of sociology said monday the study shows that policy promoting marriage for health may be outdated as other forms of long term commitment become more common the study also suggests that widows and widowers need strong reinforcement and community support help to keep themselves mentally and physically healthy
4309277 liu studied more than 1 million surveys taken by people 25 to 80 years old between 1972 and 2003 each year more never married men described themselves as healthy a number starting to catch up with married men
4309278 people live longer and the marriage duration increases over time

4309288 well i cant possibly be a part of white privilege only adjective white people are
4309289 well i deserve a pat on the back because ive been good enough to verb for coloured people
4309290 this is probably the best rebuttal to the whole fat bigotry is just like racism argument that ive read you dont come off as trying to play the victim olympics you just dont want people to usurp your experience for their cause which makes perfect sense to me
4309291 while thinking about this whole thing today something occurred to me its something thats pretty damn obvious and really shouldnt be all that much of a lightbulb over my head but it is i am a fat white woman in a mostly black part of town and when i see the reactions i get from the men and women in my area they are responding to me as a fat white woman i cannot interpret that as how they would treat a fat black woman or a fat asian woman or a fat woman of any other color than white my own experiences with being a fat white woman in a predominantly black neighborhood cannot be translated across color lines im not saying this because i think i should get a pat on the back for finally realizing the obvious im saying it because i wanted to thank you for making me think in such a way that i learned something that i think is important
4309292 im not exactly sure what is meant by the comment added to this link but i know that i have said stupid shit like
4309293 i think it was pretty clear that she was directing her anger at the white fa bloggers who engage in that behavior
4309294 defensiveness makes sense to me denying the reality of other peoples lived experience because of that defensiveness really doesnt
4309295 though if it has to be buried that deep you might wonder whats the point in trying anymore because its never going to be good enough
4309296 if you want to make god laugh tell him your plans

4309299 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4309300 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4309301 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4309302 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4309303 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4309304 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4309305 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4309306 he can believe whatever he wants in his heart but on paper he cant convert
4309307 i announced this now because i was taken to state security and interrogated for hours
4309308 they kept asking me whether an organization had put me up to this or if i was doing it for money and fame
4309309 the real reason that peter gohary has the courage is because of muhammad hegazy
4309310 this is not about fame because i am already famous google me and you will see
4309311 i am so surprised by the administrative court verdict refusing the case of hegazy this is against all the international conventions as well as the egyptian constitution and islamic law which guarantee the freedom of belief
4309312 according to islamic law islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore muslims already practice full freedom of religion cannot return to an older belief christianity or judaism
4309313 christians are expected to be quiet because of their faith
4309314 police are at the door of the cathedral and they wont let me in that is a major reason behind my decision
4309315 so i dont know why he is doing this now unless he just wants fame and money and this timing is very bad for the country
4309316 when we pray we dont make it public we go into our room and pray to god in a personal manner
4309317 what they do and especially now with all the tensions between christians and muslims across the country is wrong
4309318 they have a right to believe whatever they want but to go public and try and get famous for their conversion is wrong and is probably not the best thing for a country struggling with our religious differences

4309325 what is normally one of the slowest weeks of the year will probably now be one of the busiest weeks of all time for many of us
4309326 as soon as they announced where the rnc is going to be i was probably on the phone with first avenue 30 seconds later
4309327 im interested in real deal venues like first avenue instead of some cheesy hotel ballroom somewhere and so are plenty of republicans you wait and see
4309328 theres going to be so much traffic and congestion none of our regular customers wouldve wanted to come to shows and no touring bands couldve found hotel rooms
4309329 twin cities music fans have to have somewhere to hide out with all those republicans freely roaming our streets
4309330 a lot of clubs are hurting right now because of the economy and so are restaurants and a lot of other businesses in downtown minneapolis
4309331 some places will probably make more money over five days than they have all year
4309332 its a step in the evolution of podiums theyve come down lower and lower
4309333 it was so high that the delegates in the front row couldnt see the speaker
4309334 we had to put in television monitors for the folks in the front row
4309335 the campaign really wanted to actually get the deck down lower so he would be more like at a town hall meeting setting
4309336 you dont want the delegates waving signs to obscure your speaker from the television cameras but that shouldnt be a problem

4309393 the state expresses its antipathy to the pernicious practice of employers of hiring contractual employees working for a fixed period of time and rehiring them afterwards to prevent them from acquiring the status of regular employees and from enjoying the benefits accruing to the same said practice prevents these employees not only from acquiring security of tenure but also the enjoyment of other rights appertaining to regular employees
4309394 the proposed measure seeks to discourage this practice by increasing the salary of contractual workers by fifty percent of their monthly and or daily compensation with a proviso that if they are rehired and allowed to work for a period of one year they will be considered as regular employees of the company where they are working
4309395 lest we be accused of tolerating the exploitation of the working masses
4309396 contractual employees who have been rehired and who have served for a cumulative period of at least one year whether the said period be continuous or broken shall be considered regular employees

4309424 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4309425 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time

4309448 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4309449 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4309450 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4309451 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders

4309590 im not going to sacrifice what i can do on the field for marketing opportunities or other different things

4309608 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4309609 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4309610 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4309611 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u s ground based missiles that will protect the united states of america and most of europe from ballistic missiles this agreement will also provide poland with u s patriot missile defense batteries that have the capability to defeat and defend against short range ballistic missiles deploying a united states strategic asset that protects the national security of the united states in the country of poland further enhances the security and sovereignty of poland 72 of the american public supports this missile defense agreement with poland to view the most recent public survey regarding missile defense at www missiledefenseadvocacy org and click on surveys

4309617 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4309618 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4309619 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4309620 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it

4309630 i think that dion will have to make up his mind and i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4309631 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4309632 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4309633 its mr harper and his house leader and his whip who have been orchestrating the dysfunctionality of this particular parliament

4309689 the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would harm the economy is supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history
4309690 how could anyone mccain whos been paying attention think bush is better now than ever
4309691 the middle class is crunched which is why we need a more
4309692 heres a good question given its proven that whenever they lower tax rates percentages they wind up collecting more overall in tax dollars why oh why would obama want to raise tax rates again unless he wanted to reduce revenues

4309695 this is a disneyland original little long playing record and i am your story reader i am going to begin now to read the story of acting out the abcs you can read along with me in your book you will know it is time to turn the page when tinker bell rings her little bells
4309696 i view the next 15 20 years of my life as some of the best years im going to live i wanted to make sure those years were going to make me ultimately the happiest person i could be
4309697 its kind of getting to be a departure from this society a wife a husband have kids live in the suburbs and instead is more maybe we dont want to have kids
4309698 for me its an ultimate decision and therefore i did not want an escape hatch
4309699 i live in a small area so some people are already aware of this i bring it up quickly theres no reason to waste anybodys time if someone has a different idea for themselves i dont want to get in the way
4309700 after thinking about it it really isnt a factor to me in wanting to have kids or not
4309701 but you really should look at is a permanent solution
4309702 they didnt want to offer their opinion they wanted it to be my decision
4309703 any birth control were seeing more and more men taking control of family planning and in extreme cases like this making the decision that they absolutely dont want children and deciding to have a vasectomy
4309704 its theoretically possible but you make the best decision you can make with the information available at the time
4309705 this adds to our knowledge that lifestyle personality how we think feel and behave are very importantly tied up with risk for this terrible illness
4309706 it may suggest new ideas for trying to delay the onset of this illness
4309707 im pretty good about pacing myself so as to get things done on time
4309708 its having self discipline and energy doing the healthy things
4309709 we felt overall that the most likely explanation was probably a psychological one where for some people you have an unusually high degree of irritability aggression and impulsivity
4309710 cuba offered us full scholarships to study medicine here in exchange we commit ourselves to go back to our communities to provide health care to underserved people
4309711 health care is not seen as a business in cuba when you are sick they are not going to try to charge you or turn you away if you dont have insurance
4309712 when medical doctors graduate in the united states they are usually in debt between 250 000 to 500 000 and spend the first 10 years of their careers paying it off
4309713 in dental research bad breath is neglected because it is not a disease that will kill people
4309714 but its a huge problem everybody suffers from bad breath at one point in their lifetime
4309715 its warm its moist its like a large incubator of bacteria
4309716 there have been documented cases in japan of people committing suicide from this
4309717 in our culture its a difficult thing to talk about
4309718 i didnt know i died i didnt feel anything i still dont believe it
4309719 i looked at his face and i was looking at a dead man
4309720 that was the most frightening thing i ever saw in my life and i knew my husband was gone he was gone
4309721 it decreases cellular injury when the cells are deprived of oxygen so with less injury we are able to do a better job of getting people back
4309722 we really believe that that is going to save lives in a way that we havent even seen
4309723 our grasp on life is so tenuous its so fragile that it doesnt really matter what you worry about tomorrow because you might not have it you have to live as if youre going to die tomorrow
4309724 well okay if i have to eat the stuff too then i will
4309725 if a human received burns this bad they would be in the hospital for two or three months then begin a rehabilitation program

4309735 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4309736 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4309737 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4309738 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4309739 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4309740 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4309741 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4309742 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4309743 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4309744 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4309745 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4309746 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4309747 its kind of stylish to include page before the page number isnt it its just a matter of personal style who could be hurt by including it if i like the way it looks
4309748 does she think i dont know that the numeral that appears on every page refers to the number of pages does she think im going to go nuts and suddenly decide that it is a statistic or part of the title
4309749 there is no public evidence of her ever using the word whitey

4309756 there are several familiar faces in this stanford superstars squad but there are some exciting new additions
4309757 there were some high quality performances from these individuals in the stanford twenty20 tournaments
4309758 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4309759 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4309760 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4309761 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play
4309762 i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires
4309763 i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4309764 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4309765 as i told you after my first match im just looking to find my rhythm which i found tonight
4309766 i was happy to not spend too much time on the court
4309767 my arm gets really tired and i cant practice as much
4309768 i played some balls deep into the corners and down the middle and she didnt have a chance to step up and play her game
4309769 in the first set she made a lot of unforced errors
4309770 i think we both were a little nervous i dont think we both played our best in the second set she was more aggressive and played a lot of long points
4309771 when i was down 3 0 and 4 1 it was only one break so i didnt panic because i knew with one break im back in it
4309772 unsupervised use of sildenafil by patients with pre existing heart disease can result in serious side effects such as sudden cardiac death heart attack chest pain and stroke
4309773 sildenafil should not be used by individuals taking any type of nitrate drug due to the risk of developing potentially life threatening low blood pressure
4309774 anyone who has this product is advised not to use it and to consult their medical practitioner if they have any health concerns related to its use
4309775 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away
4309776 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4309777 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beaut trips with him
4309778 and we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow
4309779 we dont really know what the real cause is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4309780 she made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo

4309790 there is no way you can convince me that kid was just born look at him
4309791 i dont know of any bands in the area playing rock like this at one point it became something more than a concert the crowd didnt matter if it was a cop a kid a couple they were transfixed it was like i was watching a fire dance or something the band in a tight circle rockin out guitar player and singer bouncing in unison to a pulse that the drummer and bass player were locked into like everyones lives depended on it
4309792 ive been using paypal for my internet business and i feel they are a bit expensive is there another service you suggest using instead

4309807 god doesnt like their sin he cant even look at them because they committed their sin
4309808 he who knew no sin became sin for us so that in him we would become the righteousness of god
4309809 man you need to change your ways i cant have anything to do with you unless you leave your life of sin

4309819 la ventaja es que la bacteria viva colabora en la degradaci n de la mancha act a directamente sobre el producto del derrame acelerando el proceso natural
4309820 el uso de microorganismos para limpiar matrices ambientales no es nuevo
4309821 la ventaja es tener un producto nuestro que es compatible con nuestro medio ambiente
4309822 lo novedoso es el emulsificante y la forma de hacer el producto esto es lo que podr amos patentar en uruguay
4309823 el compuesto se produce ofreci ndole al microorganismo un ambiente que tenga los nutrientes necesarios para que se desarrolle de d nde sacamos los nutrientes de desechos lo cual tiene cero costo
4309824 el proceso de elaboraci n no es complicado desde el punto de vista tecnol gico y estamos pensando en hacer todo en la planta que elijamos como fuente de efluentes
4309825 sustituye el tratamiento cl sico de efluentes en vez de tener un problema generamos un producto
4309826 el emulsificante podr a venderse sin problema el producto que contiene la bacteria viva depende de la legislaci n de cada pa s si permite ingresar organismos vivos
4309827 la limpieza no es completa y demora mucho tiempo eso restringe su uso a situaciones donde la contaminaci n no es muy grande y no hay urgencia por una descontaminaci n r pida
4309828 para usarlo en alimentos tenemos que purificar el compuesto es un proceso m s complicado y lo vemos a m s largo plazo
4309829 m s de una crema que se utiliza para el tratamiento de la piel contiene sustancias emulsificantes a las empresas les servir a por un tema de marketing de tener un nuevo producto y tambi n por la estabilidad las emulsiones que se hacen con este producto son muy estables y eso importa en cosm tica que la emulsi n no se corte como ocurre con una mayonesa
4309830 si ma ana hay un derrame nos ponemos a preparar
4309831 el fin de esta investigaci n no es la universidad sino que esperamos que el producto termine en manos de una peque a empresa que se asocie con otra a la que le sirva tratar sus efluentes generando en conjunto un producto que tiene valor

4309843 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4309844 in order to preserve the capital value of the unitholders investments in the fund and until such time that the above assessment and audit have been completed the board has determined that the fund will not pay distributions from the months of july and august
4309845 we understand that many of our unitholders staff and directors are relying on these distribution payments in what has been a challenging year
4309846 but the board must ensure that the value of the funds assets and unitholders investments are preserved and this can only be done by ensuring the projects financed by the fund are completed in an orderly manner
4309847 the board have considered the interests of all stakeholders and believe that the terms of the proposal are designed to protect the interests of all parties so that unitholders will get full value for their investment yet there will be no dilution of value to ordinary shareholders
4309848 loans scheduled to be repaid during september and october should generate sufficient funds to fully repay the funds finance facility leaving it debt free at the time the offer opens to unitholders

4309865 i cant stop thinking about how i got here i mean even you said that there was no way i walked anywhere with a broken leg
4309866 i was about to jump the last five stairs but i caught my foot on the bag and fell

4309875 horizontal ad networks are doing a complete disservice to their advertisers and publishers by creating a commodity ad brokering business that undervalues publishers inventory and doesnt take into consideration marketer branding goals apart from bulk pricing
