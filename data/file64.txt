640001 yes i know why this packet of postcards is here you had them in an album and decided it was taking up too much room so you took them all out and put them in boxes and that pretty but pale greetings card of a white sea unicorn swimming in sea breakers by jan brett was a particular favourite of yours and you put it in a cheap and ugly old frame which you eventually got rid of as it was just annoying you but you kept the card and here it is amongst the old postcards

640052 i prayed to god for his mercy that all might go well to his greater glory and the symphony began
640053 i immediately feel vibrations that thrill my whole being these are the spirit illuminating the soul power within and in this exalted state i see clearly what is obscure in my ordinary moods then i feel capable of drawing inspiration from above as beethoven did straightway the ideas flow in upon me directly from god and not only do i see distinct themes in my minds eye but they are clothed in the right forms harmonies and orchestration measure by measure the finished product is revealed to me when i am in those rare inspired moods the power from which all truly great composers like mozart schubert bach and beethoven drew their inspiration is the same power that enabled jesus to work his miracles it is the power that created our earth and the whole universe

640059 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
640060 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
640061 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
640062 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
640063 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
640064 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
640065 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
640066 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
640067 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
640068 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
640069 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
640070 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house

640085 theyre going to tell you i dont look like you
640086 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
640087 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
640088 i personally would want to see our tragic history acknowledged weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
640089 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
640090 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
640091 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
640092 i think is sic a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
640093 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
640094 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
640095 and what that means is that were going to try to get things done at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
640096 i think is sic a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
640097 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
640098 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
640099 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
640100 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
640101 but dont worry bill youre still dominating that important demographic 65 to dead
640102 crows about the ratings and then gets them wrong again
640103 and bill o the clown gets caught with his ratings down
640104 bill o crows about the ratings and then gets them wrong again in worst persons
640105 ive got your reality check right here goober in july countdown was the number three rated show in all of cable news adults 25 to 54 behind bill o and hannity we were the number two rated show in all of cable news adults 18 to 49 and we were the number one rated show in all of cable news adults 18 to 34 and bill o was third since i was off for two weeks in july i want to thank rachel maddow for kicking the asses of laura ingraham john kasich and e d hill but dont worry bill youre still dominating that important demographic 65 to dead
640106 finally finally the ratings for july are in the tv ratings causing a true reality check for cnn and msnbc fox news ranked number six in prime time thats among all cable channels cnn 22 msnbc 30 right behind the tomato channel since i was off for a few days in july i want to thank laura ingram john kasich and e d hill for keeping the numbers up

640109 five steps to the door a hundred to the street three hours until sleep
640110 did it bite molest or otherwise threaten you in any way
640111 no but i touched it could i get a disease you think
640112 thats not surprising the raccoon is a wily creature much more so than the fox
640113 no i am saying that it is highly likely that a raccoon stole your wallet
640114 nature is broad in her scope and sinister in her machinations
640115 since the advent of fire nature has occasioned the demise of man coddling him to render him weak and dependent and turning on him at his most vulnerable taunting him with favors only to ultimately sabotage his endeavors but man will not be so easily stymied oh no he has fought back valiantly with the tools of industry with the skyscraper with the neutron bomb
640116 the mighty hand of human progress leaves its fingerprints everywhere and yet the banshee is relentless still man will persevere i believe in man did you know for instance
640117 that the u s government now has the ability to manufacture and control weather patterns im not kidding you we have the technology the power and about a million reasons to make nature our slave yeah were hot on her tail all right
640118 most people dont know this but the misappropriated term natures bounty refers not to her yield but to the price on her head
640119 nature is a filicidal whore and the raccoon just one of her scheming little minions send out to achieve the unthinkable by accomplishing the illogical what appears to us to be an underlying order is really just a coalescing of the unidirectional homicidal impulses of queen bitch herself the mother of all matriarchs and do you think im going to stand idly by like some chump just waiting to get done in by the nipple ive suckled for six million years that goddamn nipple full of poison i wont do it i wont go out like that i was made for better things
640120 look im trying to help people ok im a people person
640121 see i know how it feels one time a raccoon stole my wallet it had my drivers license my credit cards pictures of my kids son of a bitch
640122 i went out for some cigarettes one night reached into my pocket to pay and nothing no wallet then i remembered when this happened to a buddy of mine some raccoon pilfered his wallet on a crowded city bus at any rate i called animal control and they recovered my wallet under a tree somewhere what was weird though the pictures were gone those things cost me over 200 at the sears portrait studio
640123 so how do you know that a raccoon stole it
640124 how do think it got there a fucking squirrel whats a squirrel going to do with a damn wallet
640125 eaters of garbage and purveyors of general filth and iniquity the world would be better off without them
640126 i like flowers and apples and trees and dogs and
640127 why dont you tell nature to give me back my fucking pictures
640128 i bet you work too much why dont you take a walk or something get a little fresh air
640129 you promised us a large hot meal you owe it to us you gotta feed us those are the rules
640130 eat up eat plenty and well and who cares if you spill spill all over the goddamn place you are our guests
640131 come on outta there you two toned motherfuckers pretend youre us and you can shit us out and make the grass grow
640132 we nailed shit to other shit just for the hell of it for a time we could discern blood type just by the way it tasted really our lives are so much better now
640133 may we bore you with the details of last nights dream
640134 you know the rules you listen and then disagree those are the rules
640135 we know were not very powerful but were at least a little powerful
640136 hm it must be my half of our double tree inn intercourse i forgot to throw it away

640146 then id take the pieces of our last intercourse and have them bronzed then i would have intercourse with our bronze intercourse and glue that half intercourse to the side of our intercourse then i would have intercourse with that intercourse and glue that half intercourse to another side of our intercourse and so on and each consecutive half intercourse would cling barnacle like to the ballast of our last intercourse in memoriam

640148 my wife lara and i are in the market for a house right now
640149 so i have to win and win big in order to get a down payment
640150 that was a technical error on my part when somebody is shooting in on you youve got to be kind of a counterpuncher like chuck liddell and i was a little too over aggressive
640151 i went for the kill early and all he wanted to do was go the distance and i gave it right to him by going for it every time i didnt use my range effectively or my footwork
640152 mccrorys the kind of guy whos going to come straight out and look to dominate

640155 ive got to acclimate myself i think theres a mountain range i might go up there and maybe hike a little bit theres a bunch of organic farms out there i might want to visit
640156 i like to say that dieting is like your homework and you can go to the gym you can go to class but if you dont do your homework youre really not going to get good grades
640157 this way all my energy will be available for the task at hand
640158 the days leading up to the fight im going to rest as much as possible and do what i can to build my mineral reserves
640159 ive got a bunch of shows already scripted because its something i want to do so if anybodys reading this and theyre a film student or they want to get involved in something like that id love for them to contact me
640160 i would say that its more like an anxious anticipation rather than being scared if anything there would be a fear of just wanting to do my best my opponent and i are going in there to hurt each other so you know if i wasnt nervous thered probably be something wrong with me

640215 tapi saya pulang ke papua nugini pada kamis 23 agustus
640216 hanya beberapa menit setelah kami turun api menelan pesawat dan kami mendengar ledakan
640217 ketika api membesar ada ledakan besar dan para penumpang masih di tengah tengah evakuasi
640218 slide perosotan darurat itu otomatis terkembang beberapa menit sebelum pesawat hangus terbakar
640219 saya prihatin karena pesawat itu meledak tapi beruntung semua orang bisa selamat
640220 itulah yang memicu timbulnya api dan memaksa kru mengevakuasi seluruh penumpang
640221 pesawat berhasil mendarat dengan selamat karena itu penyelidikan lebih kami fokuskan pada penyebab munculnya api
640222 api muncul akibat ledakan di mesin sebelah kiri sesaat setelah pesawat memasuki tempat parkir
640223 selain terpenuhinya pasokan gas untuk kebutuhan di dalam negeri jepang harus meyakinkan investornya untuk menanamkan investasi bidang migas di indonesia
640224 bila ingin mendapat kepastian pasokan ekspor gas investor jepang harus membantu indonesia meningkatkan produksi gas alam cair
640225 itu kita minta kerja sama jepang katakanlah kalau pabrik pupuk kita sudah tua tua itu akan makan gas terlalu banyak sehingga mengurangi potensi gas yang bisa diekspor
640226 kami telah melihat proposal dari depnakertrans yang isinya meminta pemerintah jepang untuk menerima tenaga kerja lebih banyak
640227 ada peningkatan signifikan terhadap kebutuhan tenaga kerja suster dan perawat orang tua

640230 tapi masih ada sedikit kekhawatiran dan pesimistis terutama dari kalangan pengusaha yakni masalah hambatan nontarif yang masih dihadapi pengusaha indonesia terutama untuk memasukkan produk produk pertanian yang sangat diutamakan keunggulannya oleh konsumen jepang
640231 saya mengharapkan pergaulan antara pengusaha kedua negara atau pertukaran pimpinan usaha ditingkatkan dan akan saling memahami situasi serta sistem di kedua pihak
640232 hambatan nontarif yang kita pahami oleh dunia usaha antara lain tentang mutu produk kita yang dipasarkan di jepang untuk memenuhi persyaratan teknis dan barangkali termasuk persyaratan kesehatan atau medis
640233 indonesia juga menyambut baik dan berterima kasih atas tawaran kerja sama dari jepang dalam konteks ini agar ada satu pelatihan satu sosialisasi dan penjelasan untuk membantu kita dalam produk produk pertanian perikanan manufaktur atau pengolahan bahkan karantina untuk komoditas tertentu dengan demikian diharapkan atau dipastikan semua itu sudah sesuai yang dipersyaratkan pasar jepang
640234 lima tahun terakhir pertumbuhan volume perdagangan kita 14 4 persen
640235 saya menyambut baik dan memberikan apresiasi yang tinggi terhadap konsep cool earth 50 yang telah diinisiatifi pm jepang ini akan sangat penting konsep yang jelas tujuan dan sasaran siapa dan harus berbuat apa bagi konvensi internasional tentang climate change yang akan dilaksanakan di bali pada desember mendatang
640236 kalau berbicara mengenai pasar otomotif indonesia salah satu hal yang krusial adalah menyangkut infrastruktur untuk ekspor khususnya pelabuhan tanjung priok yang butuh pengembangan
640237 berbagai langkah positif akan mendorong upaya produsen jepang untuk meningkatkan kapasitas ekspor yang dimilikinya
640238 kami akan berupaya sebaik mungkin karena mengubah kebijakan berarti memperbaiki birokrasi aparat dan tidak bisa mengubah birokrasi dengan mudah
640239 keidanren dan kadin sendiri berharap bahwa dalam lima tahun ke depan investasi yang masuk dari jepang ke indonesia menjadi usd 7 miliar meningkat dari 2005 yang hanya usd 1 6 miliar
640240 mereka jepang tidak bisa menaruh basis produksi di thailand atau malaysia yang berpenduduk 80 juta untuk memasok negara berpenduduk 220 juta jiwa
640241 mulai masalah mutu hingga standar kesehatan produk produk indonesia harus disiapkan dan dibuat perjanjiannya
640242 saat ini nilai perdagangan indonesia dengan jepang mencapai usd 15 miliar
640243 perjanjian ini akan memperkuat hubungan bilateral kedua negara yang akan berusia 50 tahun pada tahun depan
640244 kami indonesia lebih fokus pada hal hal yang konkret terlebih dahulu menyangkut lng extension itu masih sedang dikaji
640245 kami telah melihat proposal dari depnakertrans yang isinya meminta pemerintah jepang untuk menerima tenaga kerja lebih banyak
640246 ada peningkatan signifikan terhadap kebutuhan tenaga kerja suster dan perawat orang tua
640247 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
640248 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
640249 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
640250 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
640251 yes thats yr friend ernie he flew a lancaster didnt he

640259 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
640260 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
640261 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
640262 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
640263 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
640264 when we were in france we told them about the syrian position on irans nuclear issue but they asked us if we have details of the iranian programme
640265 in this trip we got details so in future if we are asked again we know irans position
640266 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
640267 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
640268 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
640269 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
640270 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
640271 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
640272 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
640273 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
640274 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
640275 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
640276 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
640277 we are requesting the media and the public for privacy
640278 we want to look at their safety systems to make sure that the systems are operating the way they should
640279 all these things are stated in manuals we want to make sure that what is in the manuals is being done
640280 our operations are first class and are continually subject to the scrutiny of australian and overseas regulators as well as our own internal audits
640281 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen we agree and are totally confident these checks will confirm the integrity of our engineering and maintenance operations and our commitment to safety
640282 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
640283 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
640284 now it appears we have got to do the best job we can possibly do within a budget
640285 and its not just a love y dove y story it has a bit of suspense on the side really cool

640481 la leggenda narra di un uccello che canta una sola volta nella vita pi soavemente di ogni altra creatura al mondo da quando lascia il nido cerca e cerca un grande rovo e non riposa finch non lo abbia trovato poi cantando tra i rami crudi si precipita sulla spina pi lunga e affilata e mentre muore con la spina nel petto vince il tormento superando nel canto lallodola e lusignolo una melodia suprema il cui scotto la vita ma il mondo intero tace per ascoltare e dio in paradiso sorride al meglio si perviene soltanto con un grande dolore o cos dice la leggenda

640485 if future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than sorrow we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology we must leave them a glimpse of the world as god made it not just as it looked when we got through with it
640486 only now i realize that it is a shift that will take some time when one wants to train the trunk of a miniature bonsai tree to turn in a new direction one cannot simply bend it in that direction all at once or the trunk will break one must wrap the trunk with wire and slowly ever so slowly shape it in small increments only then can it survive the stress
640487 living things resist precipitous transformation organic things from cellular organisms to the belief systems that take root in the fertile soil of our thoughts prefer homeostasis in a living universe a universe constantly awash with restless and dynamic forces resistance to change even has a certain amount of survival value that is why change often takes such a long time but in a dynamic universe change is also inevitable and this too is how it must be it is like growing bonsai
640488 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
640489 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
640490 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
640491 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
640492 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
640493 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
640494 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
640495 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
640496 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
640497 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
640498 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
640499 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
640500 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
640501 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
640502 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
640503 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
640504 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
640505 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
640506 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
640507 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
640508 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
640509 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
640510 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
640511 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
640512 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
640513 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
640514 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
640515 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
640516 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
640517 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
640518 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
640519 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
640520 some wonder why so many are so evil in the face of such rampant wickedness perhaps we should ask how any turn out to be good the answer is that god has placed the broad principles of his law in every human heart romans 2 15 the good moral man responds to the law in his heart even though he may not know god

640523 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
640524 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
640525 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
640526 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
640527 the overwhelming support and help weve had through this would indicate that people would do everything they could to help but if theres a sinister side to it someone might be sitting on something that they know or saw
640528 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
640529 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
640530 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
640531 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
640532 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
640533 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
640534 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
640535 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
640536 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
640537 today was our first bump in the road in terms of having too many negative things happen in practice and i think thats a credit to their focus and their energy level and staying true to its training camp
640538 everybody is going through it and theyve done a really good job no one is really talking about it frankly

640544 services like google were born on the desktop and then moved later to mobile when moving the service to mobile something gets lost in the translation a desktop user will use search 5 times a day or more but a mobile user that discovers google mobile or yahoo onesearch typically only searches once every 5 to 7 days we believe that to get people to use mobile search 5 times a day or more in other words to make mobile search a mass market service rather than a niche service then you have to give it a social context mobiles are supersocial devices so if your service isnt relevant to you in a social way it wont get used that often
640545 so the number of virginia delegates who wil vote for huckabee is exactly what it should be zero

640548 governor romney s recent conversion to conservative and pro life principles is not credible

640583 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
640584 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
640585 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
640586 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
640587 recently newspapers and wire services across the country reported that the u s governments deficit is expected to surge to an astounding half trillion dollars next year heres the kicker that figure doesnt include billions more dollars that will likely nay most definitely be spent on the iraq war and if the economy doesnt pick up that figure will undoubtedly grow even bigger as washington officials try to correct our economic woes by pumping artificial money into the hands of unsuspecting americans folks this is big we are facing the largest deficit in terms of dollar amounts in u s history and no one seems to care at least our presidential candidates dont seemed shaken by the bleak news neither barack obama nor john mccain are proposing any budget cuts rather obama is promising to expand social programs health care and education initiatives mccain is promising tax cuts across the board and will keep troops in iraq without budget cuts in other sectors both candidates campaign platforms are a recipe for disaster

640593 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
640594 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
640595 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
640596 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that make up the feathers
640597 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
640598 if the study results are good then we will apply for a patent and publish the study

640602 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
640603 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
640604 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
640605 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
640606 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
640607 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
640608 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
640609 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients

640722 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
640723 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
640724 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
640725 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
640726 i am not really ready for movies yet it calls for a bit too much commitment

640744 i think we both agree no issue is more important to families in northeast wisconsin than the skyrocketing cost of gasoline

640746 when john returns the 50 000 hes taken from oil and gas special interests

640754 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time

640759 and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said does not your master pay tribute greek pay the double drachma which was the exact amount of the annual temple tax he says yes peter was embarrassed and apparently not honest with his answer and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him greek prophthano to get an earlier start of forestalls or anticipated him saying what do you think simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute taxes of their own children sons or of strangers peter said unto him of strangers jesus said unto him then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first comes up and when you have opened his mouth thou shall find a piece of money gk statar the exact temple tax for two that take and give unto them for me and thee

640762 bring ye all the money into the pastors bank account
640763 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he jesus is so are we in this world
640764 then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men
640765 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps
640766 give to him that asks you and from him that would borrow of you turn not thou away
640767 the churches in macedonia and achaia you see have thought it a good thing to make a contribution towards the poor christians in jerusalem they have decided to do this and indeed they owe it to them for if the gentiles have had a share in the jews spiritual good things it is only fair that they should look after the jews as far as the good things of this world are concerned
640768 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over
640769 i have showed you all things how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive
640770 but this i say he which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposes in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity gk compulsion as in a commanded law for god loves a cheerful giver
640771 but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own household he has denied the faith and worse than an infidel
640772 pay your church bills the same way i pay my living expenses with a check
640773 here paul here is my payment according to the tithing law with regards to my thousand dollar paycheck
640774 sir money is not a tithable commodity furthermore tithes can be paid to the levitic priests only and i am not a levite i am from the tribe of benjamin furthermore as a believer in jesus christ you are also freed from the law of moses jesus christ has taught us that freely you have received freely give
640775 well if this 100 is your tithe where is your offering dont you know that the tithe is commanded and demanded by law you have only given me what is commanded by law of you to give you have not really giving me anything until you give me money in excess of your tithes
640776 and the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess
640777 in that he says a new covenant he has made the first old now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away
640778 and no man puts new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish
640779 for yourselves know how you ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you neither did we eat any mans bread for naught but wrought with labor and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any man not because we have not power but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us
640780 for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god
640781 i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel yea ye all of you yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me i have showed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive
640782 for i think that god has set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honorable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel therefore i beseech you be ye followers of me
640783 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free

640787 tithes in christendom the earliest authentic example of anything like a law of the state enforcing payment appears to occur in the capitularies ecclesiasticals of charlemagne at the end of the 8 th or beginning of the 9 th century tithes were by that enactment to be applied to the maintenance of the bishop clergy the poor and the fabric of the church in the course of time the principle of payment of tithes was extended far beyond its original intention thus they became transferable to laymen and saleable like ordinary property in spite of the injunctions of the third lateran council and they became payable out of sources of income not just farming and herding but other trades and occupations and salaries paid in the form of money not originally tithable
640788 as the church expanded and various institutions arose it became necessary to make laws which would insure the proper and permanent support of the clergy
640789 will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation
640790 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat bread in mine house and prove me now herewith says the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that thee shall not be room enough to receive it
640791 that there may be meat bread in mine house gods house not the granary
640792 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
640793 bring ye all the tithe money and extra offerings of money to the church bank that there may be money in the church
640794 how do i starting today actually obey this prophecy of malachi to stop
640795 opening the windows of heaven and pouring out a blessing
640796 behold i will send my messenger but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
640797 and i will come near to you to judgment not just the priests but many of the people as well and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me says the lord of hosts
640798 you offer polluted bread upon my altar if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil
640799 and now o ye priests this commandment is for you i will curse your blessings behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your face
640800 but you have departed out of the way ye have corrupted the covenant of levi therefore i have also made you contemptible and base before all the people
640801 behold i will send my messenger but who may abide the day of his coming he is like a refiners fire like the lake of fire a nd he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
640802 then they that feared the lord spoke often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them and they shall be mine says the lord of hosts in that day when i made up my jewels and i will spare them then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serves god and him that serves him not do you not know that the saints shall judge the world
640803 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse
640804 for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come
640805 if then i be a father where is mine honour my fear o priests that despise my name
640806 and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil the sick and the lame is it not evil
640807 i have no pleasure in you neither will i accept an offering at your hand
640808 ye are gone away from mine ordinance and have not kept them
640809 and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses
640810 our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
640811 meat in my house and prove me now herewith says the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a
640812 to pluck off or pull to pieces to supply with food as in morsels
640813 moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father gives you the
640814 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and
640815 bring ye all the tithes into the store house that there may be meat bread in mine house and prove me now herewith says the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it
640816 and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto your governor will he be pleased with you or accept your person says the lord of hosts
640817 pure religion and undefiled before god and the facher is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world
640818 take ten percent of the social security checks and welfare checks of the
640819 love the world and the things that are in the world
640820 motivated by greed they will exploit you with their counterfeit arguments
640821 in their lust they will exploit you with cunning arguments
640822 in their greed for money they will trade on your credulity with sheer fabrications
640823 now all these things happened unto them for examples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come
640824 ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward
640825 o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
640826 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken a contrite heart
640827 the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saves such as be of a contrite spirit
640828 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat
640829 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he jesus is pure
640830 offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the lord
640831 and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing
640832 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
640833 and the levite because he has no part nor inheritance with you and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within your gates shall come and shall eat food from the land and be satisfied that the lord your god may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do
640834 aujourdhui j tais la nounou de 3 petites g es de 3 5 et 7 ans on regarde bambi et quand la m re meurt les larmes me montent au yeux pas aux petites qui sont venues sur me genoux pour me consoler mexpliquant que ce n tait quun dessin anim vdm
640835 and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he
640836 for this melchizedek king of salem priest of god most high who meets with abraham returning from the combat with the kings and blesses him to whom abraham parts a tithe also from all now behold how eminent this one is to whom the patriarch abraham gives a tithe also of the best of the booty and indeed those of the sons of levi who obtain the priestly office have a direction to take tithes from the people according to the law and here indeed dying men are obtaining tithes and so to say through abraham levi also who is obtaining the tithes has been tithed for he was still in the loins of his father when melchizedek meets with him
640837 and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and if god will keep me in this way that i go and if god will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou shall give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
640838 and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks and there ye shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee
640839 and even though there were no levites in jacobs day nonetheless there were
640840 and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lords it is holy unto the lord and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof and concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock even of whatsoever passes under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto the lord he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it
640841 but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance and the lord spoke unto moses saying thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the winepress thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lords heave offering to aaron the priest
640842 but the tithes of the children of israel i have given to the
640843 the god who makes the world and all that is in it he the lord inherent of heaven and earth is not dwelling in temples made by hands
640844 for you are the temple of the living god according as god said that i will be making my home and will be walking in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
640845 and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flock and there ye shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the lord and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you you may not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of the flocks nor any of thy vows which thou vow nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of your hand but you must eat them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose
640846 thou shall truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field brings forth year by year
640847 and you shall eat before the lord your god in the place which he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy wine and of your oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks that thou may learn to fear the lord thy god always and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath blessed thee then shall thou turn it into money and bind up the money in your hand and shall go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose and thou shall bestow that money for whatsoever your soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever your soul desires and you shall eat there before the lord thy god and thou shall rejoice thou and thine household and the levite that is within thy gates thou shall not forsake him for he has no part nor inheritance with thee at the end of three years thou shall bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shall lay it up within thy gates and the levite because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of your hand which thou doest
640848 when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year which is the year of tithing and has given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filled
640849 i want to suggest that you finish what you started to do a year ago for you were not only the first to propose this idea but the first to begin doing something about it having started the ball rolling so enthusiastically you should carry this project through to completion just as gladly giving whatever you can out of whatever you have let your enthusiastic idea at the start be equaled by your realistic action now if you are really eager to give then it isnt important how much you have to give god wants you to give what you have not what you havent
640850 what a precious heirloom that can be passed from one generation to the next honoring your commitment to the lord
640851 for we are not as the majority who are peddling the word god
640852 to sell at retail with the insinuation of improper profit either by overcharging or adulterating
640853 for we are not as the majority who are peddling the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god in christ are we speaking
640854 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps and brought in the offerings and the tithes
640855 and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough and our offerings and the fruit of all manner of trees of wine and of oil unto the priests to the chambers of the house of our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites that the same levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage and the priest the son of aaron shall be the levites when the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the treasure house
640856 and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures for the offerings for the fruitfruits and for the tithes to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites that waited
640857 and he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests
640858 then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries
640859 come to bethel and transgress at gilgal multiply transgression and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three years
640860 and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a flesh hook of three teeth in the hand and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the flesh hook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desires then he would answer him nay but thou shall give it me now and if not i will take it by force wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord
640861 now may it not be mine to be boasting except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything but a new creation and whoever shall observe the elements by this rule peace be on them and mercy also on the israel of god
640862 god who also makes us competent dispensers of a new covenant not of the
640863 for not that which is apparent is the jew nor yet that which is apparent in flesh is circumcision but that which is hidden is the jew and circumcision is of the heart in spirit not in letter whose applause is not of men but of god
640864 now those who are in the flesh are not able to please god
640865 whoever are baptized into christ jesus are baptized into his death
640866 we then were entombed together with him through baptism into death that even as christ was roused from among the dead through the glory of the father thus we also should be walking in newness of life
640867 yet you are not in flesh but in spirit if so be that gods spirit is making its home in you
640868 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove that is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
640869 every man according as he purposes in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver

640881 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
640882 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that new program up
640883 we are working on a larger contain air volume a bigger section width taller tire larger bead diameter
640884 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
640885 that was the most pathetic racing tire ive ever been on in my professional career

640890 so much creative musical talent among todays independent and unsigned bands
640891 when a long running event like the exotic erotic ball acknowledges this by actively looking to the indies to discover the right talent for their event and then gives that talent vip treatment and the chance to play before an audience size usually reserved for signed acts this is something we can get behind we heard great things from the bands they selected last year and look forward to offering up our platform again for them to discover 3 new bands in 2008
640892 ich w rde hier am liebsten f nf stunden lang sitzen bleiben und einfach nur zusehen wer raus und reingeht
640893 die stimmung an bord war gro artig die basketballer freuen sich riesig
640894 alle chinesischen m dels wollten mit nowitzki fotografiert werden und ein autogramm von ihm haben
640895 er hat es alles mit sehr gro er geduld gemacht
640896 die sind es gewohnt die beine ber die bettkante h ngen zu lassen
640897 real hat ein angebot gemacht dass der hsv nicht akzeptiert ich bleibe so lange kapit n des hsv bis etwas anderes passiert
640898 er ist momentan mental nicht zu 100 prozent da deshalb kann ich ihn nicht gebrauchen
640899 es w re besser wenn jetzt ruhe in die bude kommt der rummel um van der vaart in den letzten wochen hat uns nicht gutgetan
640900 wir haben verst rkungen im auge werden noch den ein oder anderen transfer machen es ist aber nicht leicht einen spieler seiner g te zu einem akzeptablen preis zu bekommen
640901 ich habe immer meine eins tze bekommen habe gespielt bei den bayern in der nationalmannschaft wir haben titel geholt sind jetzt vize europameister geworden sonst h tten mich die trainer doch nicht eingesetzt
640902 die wertsch tzung fehlte mir manchmal aber ich kenne die mechanismen wie schnell man hochgejubelt und dann wieder extrem fallen gelassen wird manchmal reicht daf r ein spiel
640903 er ist sehr direkt und hat ganz klare vorstellungen auch wenn 99 prozent der menschheit sagen so und so wird das gemacht hinterfragt j rgen klinsmann vieles und sagt dann auch nein wir machen das anders
640904 ihm ist egal was au enstehende denken und er steht zu dem was er tut auch wenn es anfangs vielleicht nicht popul r ist das gef llt mir
640905 ich werde auf jeden fall eine sprache lernen ich will mein schulenglisch verbessern
640906 ich denke der fc bayern ist in dieser saison auf jeden fall in der lage gegen mannschaften wie den fc chelsea oder manchester united bestehen zu k nnen sie auch zu besiegen
640907 wir m ssen uns nichts vormachen die qualit t der bundesliga ist auch abh ngig von tv geldern und da haben die engl nder spanier und italiener uns einiges voraus
640908 dort hatten wir auch nicht die spielerische qualit t von portugal holland oder brasilien aber durch die mannschaftliche geschlossenheit und den teamgeist haben wir das ausgeglichen
640909 dann ist das nicht das einzige aber ein gutes mittel das k nnte uns unterscheiden von anderen mannschaften
640910 das wir viele vergleichbare spiele haben ist doch gut f r uns dann sind wir nicht so berechenbar ich sehe das nicht als nachteil f r mich sondern als vorteil f r uns f r den fc bayern m nchen
640911 als gr te operative stiftung in europa m ssen wir mit unseren vorschl gen und unserer arbeit sichtbarer werden change soll einen beitrag dazu leisten mehr menschen mit spannenden gesellschaftspolitischen fragen zu erreichen
640912 ich muss jetzt auf jeden fall positiv nach vorne gucken
640913 mehrere rzte haben mir schon best tigt dass es vom becken her kommt
640914 vielleicht laufe ich im herbst einen marathon ich will aber nicht spekulieren ber das wann und wo
640915 die mannschaft wird sich bei olympia trotz der absage auf einem hnlichen niveau wie bei der wm im letzten jahr pr sentieren
640916 ich bin im sommer ausgebootet worden was soll ich da gro erwarten
640917 bisher hat niemand angerufen und mit mir gesprochen ich will aber auch niemanden dazu auffordern
640918 ich habe abgeschaltet und freunde besucht ich war in irland bei meinem fr heren mannschaftskollegen dirk heinen und in amerika ich habe versucht das alles auszublenden aber wenn man nach deutschland zur ckkehrt wird man nat rlich an allen ecken und enden damit konfrontiert
640919 ich wei nicht was der bundestrainer vorhat ich bin keine neue generation ich bin 29 jahre alt
640920 ich wei ja dass das gesch ft hart ist aber jetzt habe ich es am eigenen leib gesp rt
640921 unser neuer trainer unai emery macht wirklich tolle arbeit ich hoffe dass es in dieser saison etwas ruhiger wird wir haben ja jetzt den dritten pr sidenten innerhalb eines jahres
640922 ich w re im olympischen dorf und sie w rde nur auf der trib ne herumsitzen da sehen wir uns sowieso nicht
640923 deshalb wei ich dass ich eine gute chance habe eine medaille zu gewinnen aber es wird sehr hart ich muss schon einen perfekten tag erwischen weil so viele jungs um edelmetall k mpfen
640924 es wird sehr hart den ersten platz zu erringen weil yang wei sehr stark ist

640927 its a charity i feel particularly strongly about and am very keen to support
640928 le storie che cadranno in parole sono fuori di ogni storia pur se imprescindibili dalla
640929 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
640930 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
640931 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
640932 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
640933 the overwhelming support and help weve had through this would indicate that people would do everything they could to help but if theres a sinister side to it someone might be sitting on something that they know or saw

640936 mccains 2000 campaign was so tech savvy that it scared me it was the whole reason i started focusing on the tech stuff for the democrats
640937 i am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
640938 if i were counseling john mccain i would have him standing in line for an iphone
640939 i would make sure the next time john mccain is around a group of photographers hes on his iphone and hes checking out meghans blog
640940 for the love of g d dont let him be photographed using the web as if its something to photograph him doing
640941 it will just remind everyone of that time they taught their grandpa about email
640942 he should just drop it into conversation say yeah i only use firefox
640943 i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day
640944 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself

640946 fully capable of browsing the internet and checking web sites
640947 our doctor john marzo was almost right there and got to him immediately
640948 he just felt like its probably an anterior cruciate and itll take its course
640949 we met with him during the free agency period and we were all impressed with him
640950 we know a good deal about him so its a real good signing for us probably a little bit fortunate and a little lucky that hes available hopefully it will work out really well for everybody
640951 weve talked about signing him a good deal we talked about it earlier in the week and thought it might be a good idea as soon as alvin suffered the injury we knew it was more than a good idea it was almost a necessity to get it done
640952 it will give us a chance to study the tape of it and learn a lot more about our young guys some of them we dont know a lot about
640953 this is the first time weve seen them other than their college tape in live action it will be a good thing
640954 there is a limit to what we can do in pakistan
640955 the fact that were reduced to trying to send messages to the pakistanis by putting stories in newspapers tells you we dont have any good options
640956 it also suggests that the high level face to face contacts havent worked so far the trouble is these kinds of public threats are likely to backfire
640957 pakistan problem cannot be solved without an all out attack on pakistan destroying its intelligence network that support the terrorists purge its army of the islamists and teach paksitanis how to forget about puppet regimes and worry instead about their bread and butter
640958 the karzai government is totally in the hands of india
640959 why are we always trying to allay u s fears
640960 one of the biggest blunders of our elite is to see america as a friend and ally
640961 release earnings issue guidance a few weeks later lower earnings a few weeks after that take more write downs raise more capital start it all over again next quarter
640962 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
640963 what you have here is raising money just to pay off previous equity commitments
640964 potentially limitless dilution of existing shareholders if and when the bank goes to the market for more capital at ever lower prices
640965 the communists like the emperors before them have gone to great lengths to create their own history and mythology

640970 not many people expect someone from the townships to be on the olympic team
640971 the opportunity of being in the olympics is it doesnt get any bigger than this
640972 it is an overwhelming feeling something i have to take with both hands and make the most of
640973 especially root for athletes from countries where just showing up in beijing is a miracle like the zimbabweans and hopefully the iraqis
640974 the olympics tend to mint a different hero in the one you least expect
640975 the magic of the games is that there is a rulon gardner a mary lou retton or a billy mills waiting in the wings

640988 dal mio angolo non sentirai mai frasi tipo ammazzalo uccidilo mai si batte il nemico punto

641012 a finally is placed after a try or try catch block
641013 and will execute in most circumstances regardless of any executions that occ
641014 yes but there are some situations that cause that code to not be
641015 okay but lets say something catastrophic happens like the process is terminated
641016 actually the clr handles that through process marshalling can we move on now
641017 but what if you just say pull the plug a finally block wont execute when the computer is turned off
641018 thats why you should never put critical business transaction code in finally blocks

641044 o carro do maldonado estava jorrando leo que ca a sobre as rodas traseiras e o deixava sem ader ncia como eu vinha logo atr s tamb m estava escorregando um pouco e precisava ficar afastado
641045 n o pensamos em nenhum momento que causaria tantos problemas
641046 ningu m de nenhuma organiza o incluindo o mi5 falou com meu marido nem comigo antes ou depois de ele falar com o jornal
641047 confesso que gosto mais do futebol feminino n o acompanho muito os outros esportes talvez a nata o mas algo mais em segundo plano
641048 n o sou muito de acompanhar vejo mais os jogos da sele o feminina mas at gosto da gin stica de solo
641049 sei que elas alem s s o fortes e t m um apoio grande dentro do pa s mas n o conhe o muito
641050 somos dois jogadores que atuamos com a camisa 10 mas isso apenas um detalhe na sele o tudo depende de um encaixe algo que j estamos conseguindo
641051 venho tendo mais liberdade de jogar na frente mais vontade em termos de marca o com essa responsabilidade
641052 passei por muitas coisas para estar com a sele o nas olimp adas al m da concorr ncia pela posi o tive que negociar com meu clube mas n o foi for ado como muita gente disse sempre conversamos a respeito tanto que no dia da apresenta o conversei com eles ao meio dia e 1h da tarde estava embarcando
641053 mudou que eu casei que eu moro em outro pa s e que eu tenho mais experi ncia
641054 eu n o me importo com o que as pessoas est o achando eu me importo com o treinamento que eu venho fazendo

641058 estar inclu da no c digo n o s ao lado do tsukahara dono de um monte de t tulos como de outros ginastas importantes maravilhoso n o tenho nem palavras para dizer como isso importante entrar na hist ria da gin stica fant stico e possibilita poder se sentir de igual para igual com os grande nomes do esporte
641059 os dois valem 0 7 a maior nota que tem para uma diagonal do solo nas regras atualmente e eles s o movimentos at bem parecidos o duplo twist esticado uma meia volta com duplo mortal para frente o tsukahara uma pirueta com duplo mortal os dois s o na mesma posi o s que um tem meia volta e outro uma pirueta completa
641060 mas porque ele lan ou uma nova tend ncia foi ousado ao proporcionar um salto novo que fez a gin stica evoluir bastante
641061 eu fiquei muito contente quando vi essa placa ensinando meu movimento o tsukahara sempre foi um exemplo para mim e ver o hyp lito descrito numa placa foi muito gratificante
641062 o resultado n o vem saindo mas estamos mostrando valentia infelizmente n o estamos conseguindo as vit rias o fluminense n o consegue se encontrar em campo temos de acertar todas as coisas que nos envolvem
641063 temos de nos unir conversar para que a bola de neve n o cres a e nos complique ainda mais tem de haver muito di logo para encontrarmos o caminho e deixarmos esta situa o e confio nisso pois ainda tem muito jogo pela frente
641064 infelizmente ainda h machismo por mais que voc fa a um bom trabalho tenha atletas de destaque ainda v o te olhar diferente porque voc mulher

641167 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
641168 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
641169 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
641170 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
641171 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives

641175 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
641176 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
641177 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
641178 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
641179 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
641180 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
641181 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients

641206 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
641207 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
641208 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy

641306 typical of republicans so one sided on all the issues lol very symbolic that the lights went out on them sign of the times
641307 zif this isnt a cry for attention i dont know what it is cause i knoe these people arent that stupid to think that off shore drilling is a good idea but the mahority of the american people are dumb enough to buy into it
641308 there was a vote to adjourn sir but ill put you through to the comment line
641309 posted by george august 01 2008 at 12 52 pm wish granted
641310 so the gop wont leave until they give the oil companies more tax breaks way to go guys
641311 this is your boss calling to find out why you left work early today to go on your 5 week vacation
641312 it wont make any difference in gas prices for 10 years
641313 the most dangerous type of person is not the one trying to gain power rather the one trying to hold onto power
641314 i would like to regrister a complaint i called back thanked him for the transfer to a recorded message and asked him when she would receive it and he said later that evening to which i answered giving him an ear full turn the lights on now
641315 we are helpless we are awful somebody stomp on us the usa is evil
641316 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
641317 http www eia doe gov oiaf aeo otheranalysis ongr html
641318 be nice to the poor criminals he had it bad he did not mean to cut up forty people and blablabla
641319 the energy bill offers no immediate resolve for high gas prices
641320 when they refused to stop the proceedings the chairman did something unprecedented he simply picked up his gavel and walked out and just in case anyone missed the point sensenbrenner shut off the lights and cut the microphones on his way out of the room
641321 if clinton approved drilling anwr back in 2000 we would have it today
641322 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
641323 i started driving home for vacation and realized i didnt have enough money to pay for gas
641324 for weeks pressure has been mounting in congress to approve more domestic oil drilling but house speaker nancy pelosi has held the line using her power to block a vote on offshore drilling
641325 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
641326 we the little people who dont count and are to be ignored
641327 it wont save us anything at the pump 6 10 years
641328 also republicans can thank shadegg for turning on the microphones the first time
641329 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
641330 but it wont help now it will be at least 10 years
641331 no one is covering this not even fox or townhall
641332 looks like the only drilling to be done over the next 5 weeks is going to be by mister pelosi
641333 it will take years for that oil to make a difference
641334 no one is covering this not even fox or townhall
641335 how about house members work like the rest of us 8 to 4 5 days a week
641336 zif this isnt a cry for attention i dont know what it is cause i knoe these people arent that stupid to think that off shore drilling is a good idea but the mahority of the american people are dumb enough to buy into it
641337 i knoe thse people are not that stupid to think off shore drilling is a good idea
641338 the house is not in session blah blah blah we cant turn the cameras on
641339 the dems cant post any facts to back them up
641340 until we can get rid of the vast majority of you you will continue to be a cultural and social boat anchor around the neck of the rest of the country
641341 where are the rpublicans during the rest of the time
641342 what do we do in areas where the wind doesnt blow
641343 nancy pelosi nancy pelosi the american people can not afford gasoline
641344 im trying to save the planet im tryng to save the planet
641345 cause i knoe these people arent that stupid to think that off shore drilling is a good idea but the mahority of the american people are dumb enough to buy into it
641346 rub our nose in the manure cause the democrats are going to rule with an iron fist forever after obama gets the change vote
641347 i just emailed george w asking him to please call congress off of their vacation and back to the floor for a vote to resolve this issue that they keep putting off for purely political reasons
641348 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
641349 major combat operations have ended the united states and our allies have prevailed
641350 what happens in 30 yrs when theres no more oil
641351 of the people by the people and for the people
641352 the service industry we provide a service for iraq they pay us for it at least give us a tip
641353 where were you when the lying republicans were in power
641354 really contribute and cheer myself hoarse go mc cain wake him up viagra vitamins a bull horn he should be there now go mc cain jezzika
641355 a new poll just came out saying that 69 of the american public wants to lift the ban but you know what i am smarter than they are so i will decide what is best for them
641356 house republican leaders pressured 13 of their members to switch their vote from
641357 my main job is to see that bush doesnt get any legislation passed
641358 there is too little oil there to make a difference
641359 in fact the amount of oil there would only be able to supply about 1 2 of our energy needs
641360 what we would end up with is high gas prices
641361 the only people who would benefit are wealthy oil companies
641362 while the american people would suffer from polluted and ruined environments
641363 and increased contamination from pollution of offshore oil drilling which cannot be done safely
641364 expense accounts to pay for their chauffered limosines and they are flying all over the country
641365 im glad the democrats are locking them out the war pigs have had 8 years to do something about gas and oil and they havent lets lock these neanderthals out of the house when they can come up with a better plan that doesnt involve the word drill then maybe we will listen besides the drilling thing is a royal scam by bush to open up lands to his oil cronies this whole energy crisis was deliberately started by the bush white house i can see the right wingers are out in force here its because left wingers are out right now doing things normal people do rather then sitting in their parents basement like all the fascists are doing
641366 if democrats were serious about reducing gas prices now they would pass the legislation that would close the enron loophole that allows speculators to drive up the prices you know the same democrats who are in the majority
641367 get your commie backsides back to washington and be about the peoples business

641369 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
641370 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
641371 i am a man without wealth and times have become tough on us and these disagreeable years harass us and we have neither material possessions nor merchandise and this woman khadeejah sends men from among your people to do business with her wealth and they gain profit
641372 o cousin indeed i like in you our blood relationship and the undoubted nobility of your descent your trustworthiness and sincerity as well as the integrity of your character and the truthfulness of your speech
641373 he is the stallion whose nose cannot be touched i e he is strong
641374 the angel caught me forcefully and pressed me so hard that i could not bear it any more
641375 never by allah allah will never disgrace you you keep good relations with your kith and kin help the poor and the destitute serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity afflicted ones
641376 listen to the story of your nephew o my cousin
641377 this is the same one who keeps the secrets angel gabriel whom allah had sent to moses i wish i were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out
641378 anyone man who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility and if i should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then i would support you strongly
641379 i came to makkah during the days of ignorance and i wanted to sell on behalf of my family some clothes and perfume i went to al abbaas b abdul muttalib
641380 while i was at his house i looked at the kabah the sun came out when a young man came until he was close to the kabah then he raised his head toward the sky and faced the kabah while standing then a youth came and stood on his right it did not take long before a woman came and stood behind them then the young man bowed then the youth and the woman bowed then the young man raised his head and the youth and the woman raised their heads then the young man prostrated himself and the youth and the woman prostrated themselves
641381 so i said o abbaas indeed i see a great man
641382 a great matter do you know who this young man is
641383 this is muhammad b abdullah b abdul muttalib my nephew do you know who this woman is
641384 this is khadeejah bint khuwaylid the wife of this nephew of mine this nephew of mine who you see has reported to us that his lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth and that he has ordered him to this religion that he is following i swear by allah that i do not know of anyone else on earth who is following this religion other than those three
641385 verily allah has given you better than that old woman
641386 no by allah i swear that allah has never given me better than her she was the wife who believed in me when everyone else disbelieved in me she affirmed my truthfulness when everyone else accused me of lying she supported me with her money when everyone else deprived me and allah provided me with children through her when no other woman has given me chilren
641387 o allah if the messenger of allah s s anger abates i will never again say anything like i said
641388 i was never jealous of any of the other wives of the prophet s like i was jealous of khadeejah r
641389 it is as if there were no other woman in the world other than khadeejah r
641390 how can i forget her she also gave me children most loving
641391 the messenger of allah s almost used not to leave the house before he would mention khadeejah and praise her
641392 if it was me she would have been turn my into a muthafucka without a chance
641393 im not interested in my standard of living my health my job my rights my freedoms my future or any future
641394 i trace the rainbow through the rain and see the promise is not in vain
641395 funnily enough id never even considered entering into the producers competition
641396 i really think you should enter the 500 commission contest
641397 hi lyra are you sitting comfortably im pleased to tell you that you are one of our four winners
641398 i stumbled upon 4talents advert for the producers day by complete accident i emailed in my 3 ideas that they asked for 3 short films about the creative industries in northern ireland i then got news back that i had been accepted and that they wanted me pitch my idea my friend dan i was well pleased this idea was my favourite too so on tuesday i arrived at the black box to find a really informal open and trendy atmosphere the first 45 mins was used for everyone to get talking have a cup of tea say hello really i thought this bit was great it gave everyone time to settle in and even do a bit of networking we watched a couple of short profiles and documentaries that had been previously made this was really informative because there were people there who had made the previous films so this meant we could ask any questions or queries we had regarding the process then it was our turn to pitch our ideas i was about 4th or 5th to go so i felt lucky enough to have seen other peoples pitches but not have to wait until the end i pitched my idea the best way i could kept it simple it is simple so i was quite pleased with myself just because its hard to stand in front of a load of people i got quite nervous everyone pitched their ideas and we had lunch this was the time for the judges to decide who deserved the commissions i had a few strong contenders of my own there were more than a couple really interesting exciting ideas and there is a lot more happening in northern ireland than i thought lunch drew to a close and graham went through everyones pitches and announced the winners i couldnt quite believe that i won just because i am not on the scene havent a degree i didnt expect it it just goes to show if you can conceive it and you can believe it then you can achieve it so now the next thing i have to actually make the film
641399 this was the first pitching event i have ever been to so i was slightly nervous about standing up and delivering a pitch especially when i thought of how much experience the guys on the panel must have but they were actually really cool and on our level it wasnt half as daunting as i thought it would be as we presented our pitches the panel gave us feedback i found this really insightful allowing me to grasp if even only a little how a commissioners mind works im starting to learn the key to commissioning is to learn how to bowl the big cheeses over with a great idea it wasnt until the end of the day that i realised we had came closer to this than i had anticipated the panel congratulated us on being one of four pitch ideas to win a commission my first commission i meet some new people that i will definitely keep in touch with so it proved not only to be a successful business venture as we won a commission but also a great chance to network with like minded people i hope that 4talent will hold this kind of event again soon if your interested in how commissioning works and you have an idea or two in mind i definitely recommend coming along if they hold the event again i know ill be there
641400 ive just moved back to belfast and been slightly worried that it might be a bit of a creative wilderness so at the c4 4talent event i was delighted and amazed to meet so many aspiring digital producers bursting with ideas and energy there seems to be a real wave of optimism and creativity sweeping ni at the moment and its great that c4 4talent is tapping into this the event was a bit like being in the dragons den but without a dragon in sight the panel was not at all scary i pitched along with emma for a short video about a youtube star called whataboutadam hes a local 17 year old who is a youtube superstar with a global following i feel that the rest of us creatives have so much to learn from young people like him the producer event was held in the black box venue but there was nothing dark and gloomy about the day it was sparking with creativity and everyone seemed consumed by a real hunger not for the scones but for making films about the new northern ireland
641401 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
641402 the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord
641403 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
641404 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ i die daily
641405 saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
641406 and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him
641407 who in the days of his flesh when he jesus had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in thai he feared
641408 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
641409 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unco you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him who knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent
641410 then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs
641411 but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
641412 for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
641413 touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father
641414 and answering said unto them the children of the world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and then resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
641415 and as they the disciples thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of an honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them
641416 and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death
641417 and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
641418 for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings
641419 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice
641420 but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless
641421 and some jews said what will this babbler say other some he paul seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection
641422 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
641423 and straight way he paul preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
641424 so then after he lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god
641425 usually old folks ask me to pull up my pants and i do to respect them but when i walk away they go back down its how i feel comfortable
641426 instead of getting their education these kids are picking up a style that came from prisons
641427 and if they keep it up although id hope not two thirds of these people with the pants below their butt will end up in prison
641428 the older folks think that if you take off the sagging jeans and the hat youll be less likely to engage in criminal activity
641429 they just cant grasp what the younger generation is thinking
641430 its just disrespectful for you to go around showing everybody your underwear
641431 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
641432 hamas raided our family burnt our houses and terrified our children thats why we ran from gaza
641433 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
641434 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
641435 there were gunmen firing on israeli territory the soldiers extracted them under fire we fired at the group of hamas gunmen to keep them away
641436 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured

641447 as a prominent republican you should think of our partys interests and put them above personal interests

641457 exist a una reticencia a que los laicos participen en la vida p blica
641458 una serie de personas que se adelantaron a ese cambio

641469 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
641470 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
641471 that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else
641472 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
641473 that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
641474 thus saith the lord i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god
641475 for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else
641476 and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear 0 israel the lord our god is one lord
641477 we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one
641478 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
641479 then the angels called to him zechariah while he was standing in prayer in the chamber saying allah gives you glad tidings of john i e the baptist believing in a word from allah i e jesus son of mary noble keeping away from sexual relations with women a prophet and one of the righteous
641480 for he barnabas was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord
641481 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
641482 but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb
641483 so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord
641484 go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest
641485 and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah
641486 and the ravens brought him elijah bread and flesh in the morning bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook
641487 then went he naaman down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god elisha and his flesh came again like unto a flesh of a little child and he was clean
641488 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see
641489 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria
641490 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha
641491 and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived
641492 and he elisha went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm
641493 and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet
641494 and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
641495 and if 1 by beelzebub case out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore shall they be your judges
641496 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works
641497 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible hey shall deceive the very elect
641498 but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you
641499 and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went around about the villages teaching
641500 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
641501 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
641502 behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep

641555 youre talking about the pope dont you know he is sinless

641567 you have gathered today to tell the whole world that we are a voice of justice and values and humanity that we are a voice of coexistence and a just and rational dialogue
641568 thats why the conference invitation was extended to face the challenges of isolation ignorance and narrow horizons so that the world can absorb the good message of islam
641569 our brothers in the kingdom of saudi arabia have presented a great message to all humanity in the world
641570 before we speak with other religions we must speak among ourselves and reach an understanding on a particular islamic path

641577 we do not want to use force or to be unjust but we dont want to hand over our rights to others
641578 the u s is greedy and wants to control our countries and to pressure us and plunder our wealth and resources

641687 its time spent away from duty at the publics expense the police environment has gone mad we give time to this while the amount of training given to police officers on law has dwindled

641701 apelurile pe care le am facut inaintea sezonului cu privire la arbitraj au fost in zadar din prima etapa am fost dezavantajati la 0 0 cu craiova neprimind un penalty pe cae l a vazut o tara intreaga
641702 nu sint vreun smecher sa spun ca puteam bate cu 3 0 daca primeam acel 11 metri si nu vreau sa diminuez meritele universitatii insa pot sa afirm ca jocul curgea altfel daca berbecaru lua masura ce se impunea
641703 abordam meciul cu iesenii la victorie vreau continuitate iar pentru asta ne dorim sa jucam cit mai bine
641704 poli iasi este o echipa incomoda dar acest lucru nu ma sperie pregatim cit mai bine acest meci si trebuie sa confirmam ca rezultatele obtinute pina acum nu sunt intimplatoare
641705 poate fi un avantaj faptul ca meciul se disputa cu portile inchise dar asta vom vedea dupa meci

641712 het is de deugd die maakt dat zelfzuchtige liefde kan transformeren in onbaatzuchtige liefde
641713 die opvoeding had in bepaalde opzichten haar tijd gehad ze was autoritair en dogmatisch en hield weinig rekening met de individuele en sensitieve aspecten van het bestaan vandaar dat de huidige oproep van een jongere generatie om terug te keren naar de oude deugden mij niet meteen enthousiasmeert als ik de huidige neoconservatieven hoor spreken over de deugden vrees ik dat zij de belangrijkste vraag over het hoofd zien hoe wordt de deugd weer deugd wat is de bron van deugd
641714 dat zijn negatieve begrippen die suggereren dat je alles maar passief hebt te ondergaan wat je overkomt
641715 zeker bij hem is gelatenheid een houding waarbij ons denken spreken en handelen niet wordt bepaald door zelfzuchtige motieven maar wordt gedragen door een innerlijke stilte hij spreekt ook van een wijdte die de ziel omvangt die wijdte is een staat van pure ontvankelijkheid die zich in ons kan openbaren op voorwaarde dat we gelaten zijn en gelaten wil zeggen dat je alle fixaties waarin je gevangen zit loslaat dat je alles loslaat wat niet echt van binnenuit komt
641716 een toetssteen is hier het gevoel er bestaat geen duurzamer vreugde volgens eckhart dan een vreugde die is geworteld in wat echt bij jou van binnenuit komt je moet niet handelen zegt hij om wat dan ook dat buiten jezelf ligt maar uitsluitend om wat in jou je eigen wezen en je eigen leven is zo schrijft ook nietzsche opnieuw in een van zijn laatste brieven dat hij het geluk bereikt heeft dat voor hem was weggelegd hij wist zich beloond voor zijn trouw aan een creatieve bestemming die hem als kind al riep
641717 nee bij eckhart mag je onder het eigen wezen de godheid verstaan
641718 bij de gangbare klassieke deugden die we kennen uit de griekse oudheid en bij de religieuze deugden uit de middeleeuwen geloof hoop en liefde kom je gelatenheid niet tegen toch is gel zen s n gelaten zijn voor eckhart de hoogste deugd
641719 dergelijke vragen moest ik mijzelf ook stellen bij het schrijven van deze studie
641720 er moet iets zijn dat de deugd tot deugd maakt weet u wat de bron van de deugden bij aristoteles was
641721 ja phron sis verstandelijk overleg was voor aristoteles de hoogste deugd die de andere mogelijk maakte phron sis zorgt ervoor dat je bij alles wat je doet het juiste midden betracht en daardoor is die deugd de bron van alle andere deugden zo is de moedige verstandig omdat hij het midden weet te houden tussen lafhartigheid en roekeloosheid
641722 er is een prachtige uitspraak van de chinese filosoof lao zi uit de zesde eeuw voor christus het grote tau raakte in vergetelheid menslievendheid en rechtschapenheid deden hun intrede schranderheid kwam in aanzien het grote gehuichel nam een aanvang lao zi verstond onder het grote tau niet de rationaliteit niet de kunde om verstandelijk te kunnen overleggen maar eerder een innerlijke ruimte die nodig is wil er werkelijk sprake zijn van deugd meister eckhart noemde deze ruimte een louter niets dat de ziel ontvankelijk maakt voor de goddelijke instroom die instroom stelde hij zich heel concreet voor wanneer is werkelijk sprake van rechtvaardigheid of van vriendschap als er in het handelen rechtvaardigheid heerst of als uit de geste vriendschap spreekt
641723 ja eckhart vond gelatenheid terug in de kleinste handelingen van het leven zo zegt hij dat als iemand de kunst van het schrijven wil leren beheersen hij zich eerst moet concentreren op elke letter afzonderlijk om zich het beeld daarvan heel goed eigen te maken daarna wanneer hij de kunst nu beheerst raakt hij dat beeld kwijt en hoeft hij er niet meer aan te denken dan schrijft hij ongehinderd vrijuit hij gebruikt dit voorbeeld weliswaar ter vergelijking zoals je bij het schrijven de beelden van de letters moet doorbreken zo dien je dat in de verhouding tot god ook te doen met elk beeld van god met elke gerichtheid op god maar feitelijk vragen zijns inziens al de meest elementaire handelingen om gelatenheid
641724 neem een goed gesprek vaak zijn gesprekspartners zo gefixeerd op hun eigen gezichtspunten dat het gesprek niet van de grond komt een echt gesprek ontstaat als de partners hun fixaties loslaten en zich houden aan de zaak die aan de orde is die zaak moet in het midden mogen blijven het midden in aristoteles ethiek is een midden tussen uitersten bij eckhart gaat het om een heel ander midden een leeg of open midden
641725 zintuiglijke indrukken recipi ren we met onze oren ogen neus begrippen vernemen we met ons verstand herinneringen danken we aan ons herinneringsvermogen fantasie n aan onze verbeeldingskracht maar waar ontvangen we die leegte in voor meister eckhart in een leeg gemoed hij noemt dit het grootste geschenk van gods barmhartigheid aan de mens de ontvankelijkheid van een leeg gemoed of een zuiver hart gaat aan denken en willen vooraf en maakt het mogelijk dat het goede wordt geboren in onze handelingen
641726 door het leren loslaten van jezelf dat leert als het goed is elke activiteit maar de snelste weg erheen is volgens eckhart het lijden voor wie dit vergund is kan elk langdurig lijden op een punt brengen waar het duister transformeert in licht waar de afgrond blijkt te dragen tot je verbazing keert de levenslust terug eckhart noemt dit de godsgeboorte in de ziel en met recht denk ik want de teruggekeerde levenslust blijkt een andere grond te kennen die grond is niet meer het eigenbelang het eigen succes maar een wonderlijke alles omvattende ontvankelijkheid nietzsche ervoer een toestand van volkomen gelatenheid maar dat was vlak voordat bij hem het licht uitging volgens eckhart heeft een volkomen gelaten mens nog nooit bestaan en die zal ook nooit bestaan zelfs jezus van nazareth voelde zich op getsemane verlaten en huilde

641764 shows how the band would linger in a groove to find that elusive magic
641765 a riff that the band had been playing off and on in the studio for several years the vocal riff where theyre singing i got a feeling tonight everything is going to be all right
641766 unlike most bands that when they reached the end of a take would have stopped and talked about it the watts band would simply play
641767 the best elements of that showed a side of the band that isnt really documented elsewhere on record it had a kind of propulsive quality i associate with the meters or can or some james brown records where the band is exploring the groove i wanted to find some way to make that available so people could hear this side of the watts band that hadnt really been heard before
641768 let me be clear no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
641769 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
641770 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
641771 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
641772 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
641773 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
641774 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
641775 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
641776 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons
641777 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i dont have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
641778 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
641779 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
641780 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
641781 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
641782 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
641783 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

641789 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
641790 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
641791 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
641792 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
641793 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
641794 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
641795 i definitely wanted some live stuff i was influenced by james browns live at the apollo and thought it was something i could pull off with my band
641796 after grooving on funky broadway the band laid down a simple rhythm line and began to build in power wright saw an opportunity emerge i looked down at the dance floor and everybody was dancing and thats how i coined the phrase everybody get on the floor do your thing now the moment was spontaneous and could have happened on any other night but that night the machines were running when wright took the recordings home and listened to that passage he heard more than just a rhythmic interlude there was a song buried there we recorded on saturday night he said on monday i went to the studio and i cut it out and took it home after some editing do your thing was born

641916 sachin was brilliant yuvraj then batted well he is an aggressive player and i want him to bat for a long period our bowlers also did well
641917 it does not matter that i missed a century what matters is that the team has won
641918 our batsmen especially yousuf did well and i think the total was defendable but we gave away too many runs when bowling that was the difference
641919 hanuman you and your vanara sena had built this bridge several centuries back with great diligence and devotion it is remarkable that it has withstood the ravages of the climatic and geographical changes over centuries it is indeed an amazing feat especially considering the fact that a bridge at hyderabad built by gammon using latest technology collapsed the other day even before they could stick the posters on its pillars
641920 jai sri ram it is all because of your grace we just scribbled your name on the bricks and threw them in the sea and they held no steel from tisco or cement from ambuja or acc was ever used but lord why rake up the old issue now
641921 well hanuman some people down there want to demolish the bridge and construct a canal the contract involves lot of money and lot of money will be made they will make money on demolition and make more money on construction
641922 times have changed since we were down there they will ask us to submit age proof and we dont have either a birth certificate or school leaving certificate we traveled mainly on foot and some times on horseback and so we dont have a driving license either as far as the address proof is concerned the fact that i was born at ayodhya is in itself under litigation for over half a century if i go in a traditional attire with bow and arrow the ordinary folks may recognize me but arjun singh may take me to be some tribal and at the most offer a seat at iit under the reserved category also a god cannot walk in dressed in a three piece suit and announce his arrival it would make even the devotees suspicious so it is a dilemma to say the least
641923 i can vouch for you by saying that i personally built the bridge
641924 my dear anjani putra it will not work they will ask you to produce the lay out plan the project details including financial outlay and how the project cost was met and the completion certificate nothing is accepted without documentary evidence in india you may cough but unless a doctor certifies it you have no cough a pensioner may present himself personally but the authorities do not take it as proof he has to produce a life certificate to prove that he is alive it is that complicated

641984 sienna and balthazar were in new york for a few days together and then he told her he was going to la to work and see his kids but the reality is he is desperately trying to get back with his wife
641985 he realizes hes made a terrible mistake he is trying to keep sienna at arms length and hasnt told her it is over yet so she is going frantic
641986 she has been calling and texting him constantly and is planning to go to la herself as she believes she can win him back if they have a face to face meeting
641987 shes devastated that he has distanced himself from her both emotionally and geographically
641988 i cant comment when im ready ill issue a statement its because of the children
641989 balthazar and sienna seemed infatuated with each other when they were in new york last week but i heard the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon
641990 as soon as balthazar arrived back in la on monday he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house but she wouldnt let him in he stood outside crying
641991 he came back to a hotel and was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house
641992 in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids
641993 he stopped ringing his counselor and stopped going to meetings rosetta is convinced that him not being sober is the key to the whole mess with sienna
641994 she is saying the only way she will take him back is if he agrees to addiction and marriage guidance counseling he humiliated her but he is still the father of her four children
641995 sienna has been on the phone to her mother in tears asking her for advice jo knows balthazar as she was with them in italy
641996 jo has been telling sienna to give balthazar space but sienna is worried if she gives him too much space she will lose him she already knows he is drifting away
641997 if she knew he was at the house with his wife she would not like it at all

642022 the war is a plan and i am a strategist the problem is finding security in north kivu we are going to force the mandate monuc doesnt want a solution because no war means no jobs thats what the population says about them but this confusion will not last forever

642085 this raucous low down commentary on hollywood filmmaking war movies narcissistic actors and the thin line between makebelieve and reality is the most giddily entertaining wickedly smart and cinematically satisfying comedy in a season overloaded with yuk em ups if theres any justice thunder which opens aug 13 should be the breakthrough moment for ben as a director
642086 tropic thunder undeniably provokes quite a few laughs but of the most hollow kind ben stillers star laden farce makes every effort to be outrageous as it pokes knowing fun at a troupe of spoiled self centered actors who get more than they bargained for making a rambo like rescue drama in southeast asia apart from startling out there comic turns by however the antics here are pretty thin redundant and one note
642087 after a summer devoted to superheroes indeed stillers co stars robert downey jr and kung fu panda how gratifying it is to experience a movie taking the mickey out of super impossible heroics
642088 its by no means a perfect comedy nor would you want it to be gags and stunts are all over the place yet the film does de stiller erize the essence of contemporary movie comedy even as it has fun with outrageously crude jokes
642089 was probably more fun to make than it ultimately is to watch w hile stiller tries to stop it from becoming a simple genre spoof it does parody war classics including saving private ryan its more successful though as an industry satire poking fun at self involved actors grovelling agents ranting moguls and even dvd format wars the danger of course is that the in jokes will be lost on audiences outside los angeles and other industry centres

642096 or perhaps its more like when ultra high harry met super stoned sally but either way pineapple express showcases some of the funniest weed culture insights since the arrival of dazed amp confused which i wouldnt call a full bore pot comedy but it sure isnt shy about passing those joints around best of all while judd apatow collaboration will score big time
642097 putting a violent spin on the superbad formula envelope pushing raunch plus unexpectedly sweet affirmations of male friendship pineapple express emerges as a fitfully funny tonally trippy but not entirely satisfying effort from the judd apatow comic fraternity
642098 this is certainly one of the better looking efforts to come off the apatow assembly line composed in crisp widescreen images by dp whose poetic lensing in greens previous films helped earn the director comparisons to but production values are somewhat beside the point when the movie in question is more badlands

642126 tjaden amp thoenness 1997 found that stalkers most common motivation was the desire to maintain control over their victims

642155 a majority of the members of the house of representatives both from the majority and the minority are holding her accountable for her reckless attack against the speaker
642156 understandably she has never acted like a senator of the republic and has always behaved like a childish brat
642157 gobbled it hook line and sinker in her desperation to grab publicity
642158 thats the problem when youre up for re election when you are a senator you become too desperate to grab media attention
642159 i have conducted my research on this and i have come to conclude that senator madrigal was just too gullible to believe the information that was fed to her by people who want her to drag the name of speaker nograles into the swine mess
642160 i really feel sorry for her for her limited capacity to process information and see the difference between fact and fiction
642161 nograles was not even a main signatory to this agreement but a mere witness
642162 senator madrigal should present her proof without delay the longer she prolongs this the more reason for the public to believe that shes just imagining things her latest stunt to put the name of people in a bad light without checking her facts is very unthinking and very reckless
642163 ive not seen anyone so desperate to get the attention of the media it seems that senator madrigal is simply parroting the information being fed to her without even understanding what shes talking about
642164 how can a non lawyer like jose nograles charge attorneys fees and notarial fees thats very basic information that should have already raised the alarm that she is being fed bad information or what we call kuryente
642165 hardly a groundbreaker but still impressive in a good many of its particulars

642171 the unique property of the computer as a medium for education is in ability to interact write the student books and recording can tell a student what the similar are and what the night solutions are but they cannot analyze the specific mistakes the student has made and reacted in a manner which lead him not only correct solution
642172 to the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic they can be controlling blaming self absorbed intolerant of others views unaware of others needs and of the effects of their behavior on others and insistent that others see them as they wish to be seen
642173 people who are overly narcissistic commonly feel rejected humiliated and threatened when criticised to protect themselves from these dangers they often react with disdain rage and or defiance to any slight real or imagined
642174 narcissists lack a mature conscience and seem to be restrained only by fear of being punished or of damaging their reputations

642176 for many in my community it was unexpected support they saw

642178 he said this was our house and he was crying
642179 a jewish family was living there israel just took our homes
642180 when i met senter for the first time it was new there is the history always of the muslims and jews in the history of palestine theres the conflict the misunderstandings
642181 he had the cap and the robe he was the image i had seen on tv of hamas leaders talking about the rockets theyd fired at israel i shook his hand but reluctantly
642182 when i first heard about the torture i couldnt believe it
642183 that kind of treatment is clearly not a jewish value
642184 quoting the quran out of context in an effort to discredit the imam is frightening
642185 the same thing can be done with the torah or christian scripture in an effort to cast a shadow on any religious leader i was shocked that a representative of the u s government would use the tactics of hatemongers in an effort to tip the scales of justice islam and the quran are not on trial
642186 our community was not ready for a dialogue with jews
642187 people said how can you trust people who took our homes who took palestine
642188 hurting your reputation and is damaging to the entire jewish nation please refrain from these continued public statements which bring shame on our community and our people
642189 are there those who will look at him and automatically believe that the things being said about him are true absolutely these people may constitute a significant grouping within the jewish community
642190 i however have a personal and professional relationship with this man he has put himself on the line personally and professionally to say that jews and muslims can and should peacefully co exist could i turn my back on him sure i could i would be no better than the christian clergy in nazi germany
642191 i thought were never going to agree so why discuss it but our friendship got to the point where we could disagree and still be fine
642192 i really care about him he is a true friend
642193 the idea is to take that heat and exhaust generated by that process and extract that heat
642194 all you are doing is capturing the heat thats generated

642212 hamas has once again proven that it is a treacherous party that has a lot of palestinian blood on its hands
642213 whats happening in the gaza strip is a real massacre against innocent people
642214 whats happening is part of a well planned scheme to consolidate the divisions among the palestinians

642270 assistance to individuals and institutions in trouble always raises concerns about the moral hazards of bailouts especially when a case can be made that people underrated risks or were blindsided in their decision making but we have no choice here the economy teeters on the edge of not just a recession but also a more profound decline where trouble in any single sector can spread breakdowns throughout the system driving unemployment to intolerable levels to sit back and let nature take its course is to risk the end of a civil society
642271 screw moral hazard we are at the edge of an unprecedented catastrophe

642312 the embassy of israel in dublin strongly condemns all forms of anti semitism in cluding the sale of materials which insult and stereotype the jewish people or belittle the memory of the holocaust and the crimes of the nazi regime
642313 anti semitism just like racism and xenophobia is not only a jewish problem or an israeli problem but is a sickness which eats at the core of humanity
642314 if as a society we tolerate hate material we will find ourselves gradually tolerating verbal violence and that eventually could lead to anti semitic acts of violence therefore we need not only to take all these acts into consideration but to take action together against them
642315 some people come up and go nuts when they see all this nazi stuff but to be honest with you i dont care
642316 i am not a nazi myself this is just a way of putting food on the table
642317 thats where most of this nazi stuff ended up the gis brought it back to america with them after the war and now its finding its way onto the market some of it comes out of germany too with families getting rid of family artifacts
642318 the most common and convenient way to pay the toll is likely to be by prepaid electronic tag which the motorist will attach to the windscreen of his vehicle as an incentive registered users will be offered a discount on the standard toll rate
642319 the django cache middleware with cache middleware anonymous only true requires authentication middleware to be installed edit your middleware classes setting to insert django contrib auth middleware authenticationmiddleware before the cachemiddleware
642320 the united states has significantly underreported the number of new h i v infections occurring nationally each year
642321 the annual infection rate is 40 percent higher than previously estimated
642322 the annual infection rate is 40 percent higher than previously estimated
642323 for too long partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the american people and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis
642324 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
642325 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
642326 but ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning in the coming days ill be laying out additional steps i believe we must take to bring down gas prices for good and truly free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
642327 what i was saying was we cant drill our way out of the problem
642328 what that means is if we want to have true oil independence true energy independence then were going to have to become more efficient
642329 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10
642330 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good
642331 at some point people are going to have make some decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
642332 we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing genuine relief to people who are struggling
642333 is there a way to advance your view in hopes of constructively pushing your candidate without undermining your candidate

642341 only proper function of government is the enactment and enforcement of laws
642342 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
642343 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing
642344 the family are still doing things very tough a day doesnt go by where its not spoken about and looked at he said
642345 were hoping that the inquest will drive out that information that the authorities have got or the possibility that other people that havent come forward yet will come forward with something that we can use
642346 they are not willing to sell a source at everton told the observer
642347 there is a buy out clause of 20m but we are not willing to pay that
642348 is this what its come to on the left that we make fun of american heroes a guy who carved out a morse code system in the hanoi hilton to keep other men from killing themselves all of a sudden hes an object of ridicule because hes uncomfortable on tv
642349 american public remains upbeat and hopeful media reports mainly stress the positive

642353 point of contact our q amp a with james howard kunstler
642354 if you live your life the right way the karma will take care of itself and the dreams will come to you
642355 hes 60 some years old and he can go with you and more thats what gets me
642356 hes got a lot of drive a lot of motivation it motivates me
642357 the stuff he was teaching me thats the stuff i want these guys to learn
642358 he would teach me all the fine points old school stuff stuff trainers nowadays dont teach no more
642359 i feel like theyre looking down waiting on it to go big waiting on us to produce a champion
642360 it was all our dream together im just trying to keep it going
642361 the team with the best techniques is going to win and a good gym with the best techniques the gym will win eventually eventually were going to produce better fighters
642362 i just roll with james if hes talking you listen
642363 he tells me to do something i dont go against him never ever
642364 he knows too much about the sport ive just been doing this for three years james been doing this his whole life
642365 when muhammad ali came into being and forgot about techniques a lot of trainers did as well
642366 everybody wanted to dance and float and sting like a bee float like a butterfly and all that thats not old school boxing
642367 old school boxing is the proper techniques techniques like joe louis used to use proper way to hold your hands proper way to throw a punch proper way to hold your feet theres a proper way for every technique in boxing
642368 you get more out of them if you just talk to them you dont get nowhere arguing with people if hes got it in his heart to make it hes going to do it and hes going to do it right hell listen to you
642369 that coaching style theyve got on some of the football fields its all right for football players but it aint right for boxers youve got to keep their minds relaxed you cant make them tense
642370 this is simply a waste of talent and is not beneficial to students who should seek to learn the most at this stage of their lives
642371 this means bringing about a more responsible form of politics based on knowledge i dont think any political party will use street campaigning methods on campus because these are people with knowledge who will be able to make their own judgment
642372 to start something full of promise but end in disappointment failure and or disaster
642373 beginning a process of change without knowing exactly or anticipating its final outcome
642374 abdul razak was nominated to mtuc by the textile and garment workers union in seberang prai penang which is one of our 230 affiliated unions
642375 he was elected by his union and sent to mtuc as a delegate and as long as his union has no objections to him holding the chairman post after retirement he has done nothing wrong
642376 in fact if abdul razaks union still nominates him for the post again when the current term ends in 2010 mtuc can still accept him
642377 abdul razak should check his facts before making any damaging statement in fact dr ramasamy had instructed me to look into the matter as he was away in london at that time
642378 we are in constant contact with the workers who need our help most of the workers are in parit buntar and kulim and only about 300 of the 948 are in penang
642379 we helped them file claims for wages at the labour office in butterworth and we have also met the offices senior staff for discussion over the matter
642380 if the leadership insists on contesting as mentioned earlier by prime minister and barisan chairman datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi i suggest we put an accounts supervisor or a local divisional committee member
642381 even with such a person i do not think anwar can make the low key candidates lose their deposit there is support for barisan but not enough as anwar speaks well he sways the audience
642382 if we grant a walkover the election commission would save a lot there would not be any slander passed
642383 like it or not anwar is baiting barisan that is his strategy as he chose to contest when he is battling personal issues such as allegations of sexual misconduct this makes the contest uncertain if he is arrested prior to the run up his supporters would see him as a hero
642384 if he loses he would cite the allegations as an excuse and if he wins he would signal the end of barisan
642385 there should not be a by election in the first place as dr wan azizah won with a thumping 13 000 plus majority this shows the voters gave her a mandate but instead she resigned
642386 having any by election is not cheap the money can be conserved and channelled to help the poor cope with rising living costs
642387 the ceramah perdana menuju ke putrajaya forum on heading to putrajaya here will largely focus on the by election
642388 it is also part of his roadshow to five states from aug 1 to 8
642389 in a weekend like that they come for fishing supplies the restaurants busy all the outdoor activities are busy
642390 it will be a definite positive for the business and right in the middle of the fair the loggers sports show its just exciting
642391 and i want to thank them and apologize for the inconvenience that must have caused to have that road closed for several days
642392 we also received a letter from the dewan rakyat speaker by fax at noon and by hand at 2 30pm informing us on the permatang pauh seat being left vacant now following the resignation
642393 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
642394 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

642427 these scammers have been approaching people with this fake gold and have been trying to sell it for a low price which would be very appealing to some people
642428 the counterfeit items are also quite weighty so shoppers may be fooled into thinking it was real
642429 they use a variety of other distraction techniques such as asking for directions and then another family member steals from their bag whilst the shopper is preoccupied
642430 we are asking shoppers to keep their valuables close to them and not to speak to anyone trying to sell gold on the streets and to report it to police as soon as they can

642442 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
642443 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
642444 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
642445 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks
642446 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
642447 the implications for our understanding of the bioterrorism threat and for our entire biodefense strategy and enterprise are potentially profound
642448 its just the right time i feel to move forward with a new captain and new direction

642454 singapore based global investment company profitable group which includes former england star steve mcmahon as a director also want to buy ashley out
642455 the newcastle chief admitted last month he is anxious to find investors to ease the financial burden
642456 ashley however was not able to spend anywhere near as lavishly as most of the newcastle united players demanded
642457 he has made it clear he will not sanction the kind of huge signings which might help challenge for a champions league place

642467 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

642477 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
642478 thats right kids go ask your parents to spend 28 55 hour so you can listen to stories told by the character who turned johnny depps bed into a oh hey kid wait a second back here its me the subtext i know that guy just said to ask your parents but youre young enough to not be embarrassed by bed time stories so that makes you what six or seven yeah thats no good your parents are going to say no or theyre going to say yes which means you have terrible parents so bad news either way dont ask them kid show them how tough you are on the phone bill now if youll excuse me i have to go talk to your dad about something called phone sex
642479 rozerem would like to remind you that its back to school season
642480 es ist unfassbar und wird keinesfalls von mir akzeptiert dass der offensichtlich politisch motivierte konflikt im lkh klagenfurt nun von der f hrungsebene auch auf die mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeiter ausgeweitet wird
642481 denn eine fristlose k ndigung spricht man entweder aus oder nicht ich werde nicht zulassen dass im lkh klagenfurt sukzessive mit angst schrecken und drohungen operiert wird
642482 for some jobs the possibilities abroad are actually very good
642483 above all i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees
642484 i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better
642485 one should not close all of the doors in ones home country
642486 i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer
642487 i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband
642488 i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany
642489 i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where its possible to get information and maybe financial help to start
642490 when people come back then theyve learned something that they can introduce here in germany
642491 ich bin au er mir vor freude dar ber diese rallye gewonnen zu haben
642492 und ich freue mich auch besonders dar ber wie wir sie gewonnen haben vom start bis ins ziel hat mich das ganze an die packenden duelle erinnert die ich mir im vergangenen jahr mit marcus gr nholm geliefert habe es war die ganze zeit ber sehr eng und wir konnten nie entspannen
642493 denn wir wussten nicht genau wie sehr wir den stra enkehrer spielen m ssten deshalb musste ich die ganze zeit voll attackieren aber die taktik hat sich schlie lich ausgezahlt
642494 nach zwei tagen vollgas durch die b ume hatte ich absolut nicht vor mir meinen 42 wrc sieg noch entrei en zu lassen
642495 eine schnelle pace zu halten und ein wachsames auge darauf zu haben was unser rivale macht es war wichtig keine fehler zu machen und ein gewisses polster aufzubauen nach zwei tagen vollgas durch die b ume hatte ich absolut nicht vor mir meinen 42 wrc sieg noch entrei en zu lassen
642496 der heutige sieg bedeutet auch dass ich eines der ziele die ich mir vor der saison gesteckt habe erreichen konnte und das ist ein sehr befriedigendes gef hl
642497 in der weltmeister bringt mich das auch wieder bis auf einen punkt heran es war auch f r citro n in der herstellerwertung ein positives wochenende
642498 die finnen auf ihrem eigenen terrain zu schlagen ist eine unbeschreibliche erfahrung
642499 die finnen auf ihrem eigenen terrain zu schlagen ist eine unbeschreibliche erfahrung f r mich ist damit ein traum wahr geworden ich lese den aufschrieb hier nicht anders vor als irgendwo anders anders ist nur der speed in dem die ansagen kommen m ssen und es ist einfach ein sensationelles feeling bei 200 stundenkilometern mit allen vier reifen zu driften
642500 wir sind am letzten tag so gefahren dass wir den vierten platz verteidigen konnten
642501 ich bin mit meiner performance an diesem wochenende sehr zufrieden und ich habe auch keine fehler gemacht ich habe zudem viel neues dar ber gelernt wie man bei einem so speziellen event fahren muss auf dem erfahrung so wichtig ist es gibt aber noch bereiche in denen ich mich verbessern muss zum beispiel beim bremsen
642502 conversei com diversos consultores e eles d o dicas do que fazer nessa semana para conseguir aumentar as vendas
642503 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
642504 hopefully this will make my last few years an exciting time i wont be at the oval i need a few weeks away from the game
642505 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
642506 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen
642507 im vergangenen jahr hatte ich wirklich die m glichkeit um die meisterschaft zu fahren und das war auch okay ich wusste dass das in diesem jahr nicht mehr m glich sein w rde
642508 w rde ich allerdings noch f r mclaren mercedes fahren dann w re ich vermutlich in der gleichen position und h tte nicht die chance auf siege
642509 erst einmal muss ich sagen dass es bei der vertragsaufl sung mit fernando einige konditionen gab die das verhalten der beiden beteiligten parteien danach regeln sollen
642510 wir haben nicht vor diese vereinbarung zu brechen seine meinung ist seine meinung ich werde nichts kommentieren was fernando getan oder gesagt hast
642511 was ich sagen kann ist dass man bei heikki keine seile sieht die ihn fesseln w rden und er ist ein ehrlicher kerl er wird jeden davon berzeugen dass sich das team der absoluten chancengleichheit verschrieben hat
642512 so war es immer und so wird es immer sein
642513 die leute m gen auf das vergangene rennen zeigen und sagen dass dort ganz klar teamorder im spiel war denn es sei offensichtlich gewesen dass heikki lewis vorbeigelassen habe die fakten sind aber schlicht und ergreifend dass lewis sieben zehntelsekunden schneller war als heikki und der wiederum wusste das sehr wohl ihm wurde nicht gesagt lewis berholen zu lassen
642514 wenn du aber in einem team bist und wei t dass dein teamkollege die chance hat das rennen zu gewinnen und du nicht dann f llst du eine entscheidung und die ist dem anderen piloten die chance auf den rennsieg zu erm glichen und genau das hat er gemacht
642515 the potential for something to happen is much greater now than it was in 2001 simply because of developments of technology and education
642516 we may be putting dangerous pathogens in the hands of people who would deliberately cause harm we may also be putting them in the hands of people who may inadvertently or unintentionally take steps to put large numbers of people at risk
642517 if smallpox returned today we could contain it and minimize the danger very quickly i could not have said that in 2001
642518 was a very important event in the world of bioterrorism preparedness
642519 it did finally wake people up to what bioterrorism could do in this country and in the world
642520 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
642521 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
642522 weve had four more years of bad economic policies that have run the economy into a very bad place
642523 he made me feel better that theres the possibility that business as usual will stop
642524 the way you win florida is you do what hes doing
642525 mel oliver come in cap youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
642526 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
642527 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
642528 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing
642529 we still have to fight a multi front war to bring the great lakes back from a tipping point
642530 my intention is to move this and move this fast
642531 its not the container size its the commodity were worried about it
642532 theres an opportunity for commercialization if you start shipping water out of the basin in bottles the dam has broken and everybody will be after our water
642533 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me
642534 but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something not every player is able to achieve and for the people who stood up for me and spoke out on my behalf
642535 you bet your life i will cry you bet your life i will
642536 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
642537 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
642538 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
642539 they have gotten such control over the residents through fear and intimidation that if you dont keep your mouth shut if youre a whistle blower they want you out of there
642540 ive got 74 in the bank no place to go and three clips and a 45
642541 im just waiting for someone to take a shot at me
642542 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
642543 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
642544 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
642545 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
642546 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
642547 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
642548 the u s has been in first place for many years
642549 if china can beat the u s it will mean that although we are not number one in military power in sports we are our athletes can defeat the americans in spirit
642550 the games are going to be highly competitive because almost all of the worlds elite athletes will be here in beijing
642551 i hope my athletes perform at their best and do not let the chinese people down
642552 they are playing the same game that the soviets and east germany did going for sports with high medal counts that the united states is not all that good in
642553 i dont think there are going to be a lot of head to head matchups between top chinese and u s athletes theyre going to kill us in table tennis and well probably kill them in swimming
642554 what china is building is this infrastructure that will have a long lasting impact on their sports programs
642555 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
642556 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
642557 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
642558 i believe hes a big kid or he wouldnt go around intimidating people who are just doing their job
642559 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
642560 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
642561 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
642562 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
642563 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
642564 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
642565 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
642566 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
642567 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
642568 no matter whether you win or lose above all do it with spirit win honour for the motherland
642569 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
642570 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
642571 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
642572 they are almost obsessed with this show because of the way he interacts with and treats his wife
642573 viewers first fell in love with what is familiar in the show muhannads arranged marriage the respect shown to elders the family all living together in one house
642574 but what led to their utter fascination is what differentiates it from their lives the romance within the marriage the open honest communication between husband and wife
642575 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
642576 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
642577 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
642578 prison happens to be the longest running political seminar in burma
642579 you could say things there that you couldnt outside and we observed anniversaries that we couldnt in normal life
642580 i want to live out of water but i cant get on the shore
642581 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
642582 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
642583 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
642584 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
642585 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
642586 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
642587 my real crime is speaking out in defense of the democratic governance egyptians deserve
642588 there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis
642589 they were just looking for a place to record but after hearing our music they asked us to join and we just couldnt turn them down
642590 george worked very hard to reach the goals he had set in his hope to cure disease what we must remember is that to reach our goals we must pass over the deepest valleys of our lives the darkest pit can appear to swallow us up the lord is there to bridge that gap as the firm foundation under our feet ready to hold us up when we teeter on the edge dont ever lose sight of the other side where the valley will be no more
642591 some years ago the main roads of javaherdeh were paved now we have electricity but progress should not stop there
642592 we need high speed internet connections the world is changing fast if we dont adapt we will disappear
642593 our village is beautiful and we should exploit its splendor
642594 if the locals make money it means they dont have to go to the city for jobs
642595 they gave pledges that we would be able to report without restrictions that we would be able to travel anywhere in china and uplink anywhere in china the same conditions as had applied in previous olympic games and patently that is not happening
642596 nobody stopped them or asked them to leave during their shooting
642597 move in the direction to give you the widest access possible
642598 it meets the demand of our nation to make achievements in a very short time
642599 the chinese way of training is problematic these schools emphasize only training and neglect everything else it greatly affects childrens knowledge and their moral outlook

642607 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea
642608 i have always found it difficult to walk away from the church but i have also found it difficult to walk with it this sort of love hate relationship with the church was established at an early age
642609 since writing household of freedom authority in feminist theology i have been reflecting on the question of what kind of church could in some way become a household of freedom what might a church that struggled to practice a sharing of authority in community look like if this household of freedom is to be a sign of the eschatological household of god it must have some concrete description that could help us to understand how it would function i began by asking metaphorically about the furniture in a household of freedom at a glance the contents page will make it immediately clear that so far i have come up with only one type of furniture tables
642610 whether the table is high or low requiring chairs or only pillows or spread out on the ground itself the place where the feast is spread is a key metaphor for gods hospitality
642611 church in the round describes a community of faith and struggle working to anticipate gods new creation by becoming partners with those who are at the margins of church and society the metaphor in the book speaks of people gathered around the table and in the world in order to connect faith and life in action reflection the round table work for justice in solidarity with those at the margins of society the kitchen table and to welcome everyone as partners in gods world house the welcome table

642623 yo agradezco a las organizaciones que hacen posible integrar a chile en el debate mundial sobre una civilizaci n global post capitalista por diversas razones la discusi n est m s avanzada en algunos pa ses de europa y am rica latina que en vuestro pa s y que consiste en el renacimiento de los anhelos de justicia social y democracia real esto ha sido en parte m rito de la inteligencia cient fica y obra de los movimientos sociales que no est n dispuestos a aceptar no tener lugar en la sociedad moderna se trata de los campesinos los trabajadores los ind genas los estudiantes y los presidentes populares que tenemos en varios pa ses del continente este fen meno var a de pa s en pa s pero obviamente si el presidente hugo ch vez en el foro mundial de porto alegre el 2005 no hubiera proclamado p blicamente trascender el debate en la sociedad burguesa hacia la democracia participativa o socialismo del siglo xxi no hubi ramos avanzado tan r pido en estos conceptos como muestra el 5 de septiembre estuve con el presidente de ecuador rafael correa y reafirm que el socialismo del siglo xxi es un inter s estrat gico y parte de un proyecto hist rico
642624 podr amos decir que comenz a producirse una convergencia de cient ficos sobre todo provenientes de la inform tica y de la econom a matem tica con presidentes progresistas y movimientos sociales nos parece que esto es una fuerza de gran capacidad de transformaci n y aunque algunos gobiernos no quieren discutir esto y algunos medios piensen que con su ausencia impedir n que esa plana de transformaci n prolifere no lo lograr n el socialismo del siglo xxi es una ampliaci n y profundizaci n de la democracia formal y representativa que tenemos ahora el ser humano vive en cuatro condiciones sociales b sicas la pol tica la econ mica la cultural y la militar de esas cuatro relaciones vitales la burgues a s lo concede democracia en lo pol tico y la reduce a un acto electoral cada cuatro a os entonces el objetivo es ampliar la democracia participativa en las cuatro relaciones constitutivas del ser humano en segundo lugar hay que pasar de la democracia formal y elitista que tenemos hoy d a a una de incidencia real por ejemplo el presupuesto nacional debe gradualmente pasar a los ciudadanos la econom a de mercado tiene algunos elementos b sicos la ganancia y no la satisfacci n de necesidades y la propiedad privada que permite a los due os de los medios de producci n determinar los precios que es el mecanismo fundamental de la acumulaci n y permite quedarse con el excedente todo esto avalado por un estado de clase que est al servicio de las lites econ micas esto se quiere sustituir por una econom a basada no en el precio sino en el valor donde la gratificaci n del trabajo no se hace por fuerza de negociaci n sino por justicia a trav s del principio de la equivalencia

642628 el papel de los medios grandes es la de toda empresa grande hacer ganancias y para eso tiene que reducir las iniciativas democr ticas y populares esto hay que combatirlo desde abajo y uno de los modos fundamentales es internet en usa el 50 de la informaci n de la gente es obtenida de internet por ejemplo en ecuador la derecha ya comenz la contra ofensiva y all no ten amos una p gina web que ofreciera informaci n de inmediato reci n ahora con una organizaci n de derechos humanos generamos una p gina electr nica que es un poder contra la desinformaci n de los medios en chile esta es una opci n muy importante para divulgar las luchas y crear una red internacional de apoyo

642752 i felt like we were one of the top five cars again in race practice friday
642753 we switched to qualifying setup and just missed it a bit and didnt have a good qualifying lap for the race on sunday i think that we can bring a lot from what we learned here in june
642754 we had a great car it was the dominant car here at pocono that weekend i think we brought some good data back with us and think that well have a good car
642755 thats the main goal thats what all the teams want to do for their sponsors and owners and the employees that work on these cars out of the 14 drivers in contention for the chase i think that we have as good a shot as anyone from sixth on back
642756 we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year our testing has been great i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year
642757 its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop
642758 we were really fortunate to have a race winning car the first time that i came here
642759 im able to base it on feel ever since i came back even though we are in a different race car now
642760 once you have a winning combination at a race track its easier to go back and try to find that same combination than it is to go somewhere that youve struggled and try to figure out what you need to win i think its kind of a snowball effect from the first race
642761 when i come here and im first back on the race track i know exactly what i need right away
642762 at some race tracks it takes a little while but here its just a comfort level that ive just acquired it all goes back to the very first time i came here
642763 i just went and followed mark martin for two laps i waited on somebody and i figured that he was a good guy to follow ever since then it has just taken off and it seems like he definitely showed me the line around here and i have been able to find it since then

642777 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
642778 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
642779 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
642780 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
642781 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
642782 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
642783 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
642784 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
642785 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
642786 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more

642794 schools will now be required to teach students that gay marriage is the same as traditional marriage starting with kindergarteners by saying that a marriage is between any two persons rather than between a man and a woman the court decision has opened the door to any kind of marriage this undermines the value of marriage altogether at a time when we should be restoring marriage not undermining it

642800 former aig claims supervisors have alleged in litigation that the company used all manner of tricks to deny or delay claims including locking checks in a safe until claimants complained delaying payment of attorneys fees until they were a year old disposing of important correspondence during routine pizza parties and routinely fighting claimants for years in court over mundane claims

642807 the entire tourism product will be affected every destination has a climate related component
642808 some people are going to find that they had tourism before and dont now
642809 its nice to talk about reducing air travel but many nation states depend on it
642810 think about what happens to new zealand and australia more important what happens to poor countries the maldives seychelles and africa who need it because it is the only way to get tourists in
642811 tourism is the vehicle for poverty alleviation in fiji thats how important it has become
642812 without it our economy would collapse so we have to plan to mitigate and adapt to climate change
642813 at the moment the effect is subtle but we dont want our reefs our island to disappear
642814 weve been building lifts higher in more snow reliant zones to give us more stability
642815 adaptation is expensive and the finances are a big challenge for place like kenya
642816 in recent years kenya has become a mass tourism destination hotels were built to hold as many people as possible things like air conditioning systems are not very efficient
642817 it is difficult to put money into green even if people know they should

642823 one was a good deal cut up by the war
642824 i know im going to die but i just con myself into thinking im not i dont think thats whats going on here
642825 i think whats happening is that people are really unaware of their own resilience
642826 so when people are exposed to serious threats such as when they consider their own death which is about as serious as it gets people are coping but theyre completely unaware of it
642827 when you ask people describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you
642828 people will report fear and contempt but also happiness that im going to see my grandmother and joy that im going to be with god
642829 we are all walking around unlike every other animal thinking oh my god eventually this all ends
642830 this creates a state of existential dread this knowledge pervades our everyday existence
642831 its very difficult to keep people in bad moods and i think this is one of the reasons why
642832 lets say we didnt have this i think we would have a lot more difficulty coping with failure and threats and our own mortality it would be difficult for us to find solutions we would be thinking about how bad we were feeling all the time

642852 though we were dead in our trespasses and though we were under the just judgment of god god has displayed his grace in saving us through faith
642853 t here is no distinction for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
642854 justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in christ jesus
642855 justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in christ jesus whom god displayed publicly as a propitiation in his blood through faith to demonstrate his righteousness

642861 to understand and explain american exceptionalism like it or not it may be necessary to at least understand why aeroplanes were not used in the civil war why the british couldnt use the train to get back and forth between new york and philadelphia in 1788 and why the jackson democrats kept making such a fuss about the national bank
642862 nevadas council to establish academic standards was scheduled to meet july 21 to adopt new public school history standards when some attention was drawn to what theyre up to they promptly postponed their meeting for lack of a quorum
642863 behind all the double talk about replacing fact driven chronological history with a more thematic approach the unmistakable goal is to dumb down our history classes still further
642864 in response one cheryl grames hoffman of las vegas writes in
642865 kind sir i can assure you that no job or law school application has asked any questions about the names and places of american battles of any century more importantly such a view obstructs a constructive conversation about how best to teach history to kids
642866 i taught american history at unlv for three semesters and i really really did not want my students simply to spew facts at me instead i wanted them to learn the relevance and meaning of some key facts and then to show me they could convey that relevance and meaning in a clear and convincing way sure it would be cool for young people today to know the facts of the great depression even cooler would be for them to be able to speak and write about it well employers i think place value on that ability not on knowledge of important battles in our past
642867 the most remarkable instances of those moral epidemics which have been excited sometimes by one cause and sometimes by another and to show how easily the masses have been led astray and how imitative and gregarious men are even in their infatuations and crimes
642868 the most absurd and preposterous of all and which showed more completely than any other the utter madness of the people was one started by an unknown adventurer entitled a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it is
642869 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
642870 this apparent contradiction to the teaching of the apostle paul has caused much consternation among some theologians for example martin luther referred to the book of james as an epistle of straw when compared with pauls writings
642871 i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing
642872 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
642873 ye see then how that by works a man is justified
642874 this apparent contradiction to the teaching of the apostle paul has caused much consternation among some theologians for example martin luther referred to the book of james as an epistle of straw when compared with pauls writings
642875 suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right he does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of israel he does not defile his neighbors wife or lie with a woman during her period he does not oppress anyone but returns what he took in pledge for a loan he does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked he does not lend at usury or take excessive interest he withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man he follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws that man is righteous he will surely live declares the sovereign lord
642876 the lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the lord our god so that we might always prosper and be kept alive as is the case today and if we are careful to obey all this law before the lord our god as he has commanded us that will be our righteousness
642877 if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law which are written in this book and do not revere this glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants harsh and prolonged disasters and severe and lingering illnesses
642878 if a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the lords commands even though he does not know it he is guilty and will be held responsible
642879 yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of god because we have sinned against him
642880 seen all the things that are done under the sun all of them are meaningless a chasing after the wind
642881 bring every deed into judgment including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil
642882 all of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags we all shrivel up like a leaf and like the wind our sins sweep us away
642883 and if i say to the wicked man you will surely die but he then turns away from his sin and does what is just and right if he gives back what he took in pledge for a loan returns what he has stolen follows the decrees that give life and does no evil he will surely live he will not die none of the sins he has committed will be remembered against him he has done what is just and right he will surely live yet your countrymen say the way of the lord is not just but it is their way that is not just if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil he will die for it and if a wicked man turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right he will live by doing so
642884 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
642885 the earliest christians were jewish christians christianity was born out of judaism and many early christians did not perceive a sharp distinction between the two
642886 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people
642887 but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him
642888 pauls contention with the judaizers in galatia was over the means and grounds of justification it is utterly impossible for one to be justified by the works of the law
642889 we who are jews by birth and not gentile sinners know that a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in jesus christ so we too have put our faith in christ jesus that we may be justified by faith in christ and not by observing the law because by observing the law no one will be justified
642890 because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works
642891 that since faith alone is necessary for salvation one is free from the moral obligations of the law while it is true that obedience to the law will never earn salvation for anyone eph 2 8 9 it is equally true that those who are saved are expected to live a life full of good works see for example matthew 7 16 20 eph 2 10 col 1 10 jas 2 14 26 since we have been freed from the dominion of sin through faith in jesus we have also been freed to practice the righteousness demanded by god rom 6 12 22
642892 the works of the jewish traditional written and oral law outward acts of conformity to a ritual and moral code for the sake of acquiring merit
642893 james strong emphasis on being active in the service of the lord comes out in his treatment of faith and works evidently he had been confronted by come christians who maintained that it was only necessary to believe as long as they had faith it did not matter how they lived james rejects this in a most forthright fashion
642894 he james has no idea of disparaging faith which he everywhere assumes as present and which he highly values his point is that faith and works are inseparable in any properly constituted christian life and he argues this clearly and effectively
642895 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit
642896 the eucharist is the life of the people the eucharist gives them a center of life all can come together without the barriers of race or language in order to celebrate the feast days of the church it gives them a law of life that of charity of which it is the source thus it forges between them a common bond a christian kinship
642897 this is a deserted place and the hour is now late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves
642898 they need not go away you give them something to eat
642899 we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish
642900 why doesnt christ perform the miracle that i need in my life my health problem my work my spouse my children
642901 everybody just said we are waiting for a new president
642902 want a president who acts and gets results thats true at home thats true in foreign policy
642903 assume fully their responsibility and role of ensuring their security and that of the world
642904 the friendship between the united states and france is as important today as it has been during the two previous centuries
642905 progress on european defence is in no way a competition with
642906 playing its trump cards notably oil and gas with a certain brutality
642907 transforming its insatiable search for raw materials into a strategy of control
642908 there is a strong moral case for supporting israels existence
642909 a disarmed set of bantustans under de facto israeli control
642910 if we lose this opportunity it is not going to be a tragedy
642911 the participation of ethnic or foreign supported lobbies in the american policy process is nothing new
642912 in my public life i have dealt with a number of them i would rank the israeli american cuban american and armenian american lobbies as the most effective in their assertiveness the greek and taiwanese american lobbies also rank highly in my book the polish american lobby was at one time influential franklin roosevelt complained about it to joseph stalin and i daresay that before long we will be hearing a lot from the mexican hindu and chinese american lobbies as well
642913 back where i come from we are pretty independent people
642914 my brothers and sisters all supported my decision to come here in fact they say that if things really work out for me they would like to move to africa too
642915 when i first came here you could go two months without seeing another chinese person
642916 but it is a different era now theres a flight to china every day
642917 we expect a large influx of at least 40 000 chinese in the coming years
642918 this massive arrival could be a plus for the economy but we are also worried when they arrive will they bring their own workers stay in their own houses send all their money home
642919 the chinese claim to come here as investors but they are trading just like us
642920 they are selling the same things we are selling at cheap prices we pay duty and tax but they use their connections to avoid paying tax
642921 the problem with the chinese companies is that they reserve all the good jobs for their own people africans are only hired in menial roles
642922 en realidad es una estrategia los juegos son un entretenimiento la gente adem s de jugar viene a pasar un buen rato por eso hemos mejorado nuestros restaurantes los shows y el paso siguiente era dar el servicio completo el hotel

642938 this is a typically superfluous response from barack obama like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
642939 this appearance will mark the senators 13th time on the show more than any other guest
642940 mashiach is coming this is all part of the last war wake up
642941 my relationship with him continued to be very close before during and after the guardianship matter
642942 for someone who had reached out to the media he wasnt too keen on having the media present in the courtroom
642943 this is a wonderful example he set for his family
642944 we went back as far as they had been keeping computer records
642945 they were thrilled because finally they had a way to check on people
642946 the credit checks are immediate and the rental histories are immediate
642947 and in most states other than new hampshire we can get immediate criminal checks

642960 doctors hate the idea of patients self medicating but we patients know our bodies and we can do a better job than doctors at judging when weve reached an effective dosage
642961 there are over twenty active forms of thc and over sixty different cannabinoids which are active in marijuana marinol contains only one form of thc and no other cannabinoids so its just part of the answer
642962 indvandrere i danmark der lider af barnl shed m g skuffede fra landets s dbanker med mindre de vil have en lille blond baby med bl jne n sten ingen unge indvandrerm nd v lger at blive s ddonorer

642965 im building a hotel there its environmentally friendly i went there with the make a wish foundation and met some great people there and the royal family was really friendly its built with no fossil fuel at all in abu dhabi where they have all that oil

642969 es war sehr sch n und gro es zeigt viel der chinesischen geschichte
642970 our intent is to yield individualized blacklists that not only produce significantly higher hit rates but that also incorporate source addresses that pose the greatest potential threat
642971 in reality those lists have a fairly low probability of success they wont provide you with proactive protection in practice
642972 we want a system that can recognize attackers before they can saturate the internet we want to give you the ability to incorporate bad actors even if youve never seen them before
642973 we call networks that share significant attacker overlap correlated victims
642974 we have demonstrated that we can exploit the relationships between networks that have been attacked by similar internet sources as a means for predicting which attack sources are likely to attack which networks in the future
642975 how can we get this country through this time of crisis
642976 these were the very strongest men i had no right to deprive the country of their services
642977 he does not know anything and can do you no good
642978 and i should despise myself if i allowed personal differences to affect my judgment of his fitness for the office
642979 that had the proclamation been issued even six months earlier than it was public sentiment would not have sustained it
642980 i am sorry mr president but i dont agree with you at all
642981 now the only moral value is courage which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people
642982 ich bin im sommer ausgebootet worden was soll ich da gro erwarten
642983 bisher hat niemand angerufen und mit mir gesprochen ich will aber auch niemanden dazu auffordern
642984 ich habe abgeschaltet und freunde besucht ich war in irland bei meinem fr heren mannschaftskollegen dirk heinen und in amerika ich habe versucht das alles auszublenden aber wenn man nach deutschland zur ckkehrt wird man nat rlich an allen ecken und enden damit konfrontiert
642985 ich wei nicht was der bundestrainer vorhat ich bin keine neue generation ich bin 29 jahre alt
642986 ich wei ja dass das gesch ft hart ist aber jetzt habe ich es am eigenen leib gesp rt
642987 unser neuer trainer unai emery macht wirklich tolle arbeit ich hoffe dass es in dieser saison etwas ruhiger wird wir haben ja jetzt den dritten pr sidenten innerhalb eines jahres
642988 er trainiert gut und wir sind mit der art und weise wie er arbeitet sehr zufrieden
642989 it is remotely exploitable without authentication and it can result in compromising the confidentiality integrity and availability of the targeted system
642990 unfortunately the person s who published this vulnerability and associated exploit codes did not contact oracle before publicly disclosing this issue
642991 this means that the vulnerability was made public before providing oracle an opportunity to develop an appropriate fix for this issue and notify its customers
642992 sha 3 may be faster and more efficient than the sha 2s but it will not as far as we can tell at this point do anything that the sha 2s dont do it will just be more secure
642993 cryptography gets used pretty much in any kind of system you can imagine the products we work on range from low level silicon chip designs all the way up to high level architectures
642994 it is not possible for somebody to break the codes by trying key combinations or by analyzing the encrypted messages
642995 for example someone wanting data from an encrypted laptop hard drive could bypass the encryption by attacking it while it is running if there is a software bug that enables malicious code to run this code can load the data then send it to a network port bypassing the cryptographic protections completely
642996 most breaches are not because theres a problem with the cryptographic algorithm but because theres a problem with the practice
642997 in the case of hannaford information was captured at the point of sale so as data was in flight it was not encrypted and someone was able to capture that data it was not the result of a faulty algorithm it was the result of how encryption was or in this case wasnt applied
642998 designers try to use cryptography to segregate trusted and untrusted pieces of these complex networks the more complex the piece is the more likely it is to have security defects so the overall security can be improved if the most complicated pieces are isolated from the most devastating attacks
642999 its too difficult to be sure that the software is doing what you want it to do whereas if you build something directly in the hardware and you do it right the software cant screw it up
643000 tut uns leid aber das video ist nicht mehr verf gbar
643001 dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year lindsays new album spirit in the dark is out in november so i wouldnt be surprised if its around then
643002 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
643003 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
643004 after the occupation refused to receive most of those who fled gaza dozens have returned and the palestinian police have taken them into custody
643005 the starting point has to be that the palestinians will stay here two minutes from netiv haasara
643006 and 45 minutes from tel aviv therefore we continued our meetings with residents from the strip during hamas period
643007 there was a period when they thought that everything was win win for them they attacked the crossings and assumed that wed close them and they could blame us for shortages we managed to make it clear through the arab press that gaza had to choose merchandise or qassams and mortars
643008 the claims of electricity shortages and hunger were part of hamas campaign of lies
643009 it expresses itself not only by sending people for training in camps in iran but also in giving money to the unemployed
643010 last month hamas forces took over the pa presidential complex in gaza
643011 is she from d c did we have drinks with her recently or something

643016 semejante irresponsabilidad constituye un peligro para la vida de profesionales inocentes precariza sic su seguridad y as atenta contra el derecho universal a la informaci n suplantar a periodistas en una operaci n militar es tan grave como suplantar a la cruz roja internacional
643017 dej en la indefensi n a los periodistas de telesur que han sido heridos en su integridad profesional

643020 por calidad talento est claro que este equipo puede ganar a cualquier rival sobre todo si exhibe una virtud muy importante para triunfar en un gran campeonato la mentalidad de equipo el trabajo y el esp ritu colectivos
643021 pueden durar m s pero me los acabar n batiendo por ejemplo el de partidos con la selecci n lo puede batir m s o menos inmediatamente carlos jim nez que ha cumplido 163 en la gira preparatoria y en un futuro creo que ricky puede superarme en palmar s ol mpico si con 17 a os ya va a unos juegos a los 28 ya me puede haber igualado

643026 if users are aware of the risks to begin with you are ahead of the game
643027 many risks can be addressed with technology but the human factor is usually the wild card awareness and education are paramount to strengthening the overall security posture of an organization
643028 more and more of our workforce is becoming mobile and the majority is using smart phones
643029 theyre using them not just for email but to store important records and files that leads to concern about potential data loss but you also lose control from a centralized technology standpoint
643030 this is another tool we can add to our tool box

643047 il y a environ quinze morts pour le moment et un grand nombre de bless s mais je ne sais pas combien
643048 il y a du sang partout des morts des bless s dans toute la rue
643049 je nai jamais vu un tel carnage dapr s ce que jai pu voir ce sont toutes des femmes qui nettoyaient le quartier
643050 cest le plus grand nombre de victimes civiles que nous recevons en un seul incident depuis plusieurs semaines
643051 elle faisait ce travail depuis trois mois maintenant elle laisse trois orphelins
643052 i actually said to my coach im getting out after 100m if there are fish in the water that i dont like
643053 i was told i had more of an aptitude for weightlifting
643054 that was about the last sport i was interested in
643055 for a start its not as strict as gymnastics in gymnastics you cant eat anything here you eat whatever you want
643056 there are girls who are interested in weightlifting its the dads who dont let them they worry that youre going to look like a bull
643057 i tell them that in mexico we have strong women who can excel in this sport so we have this great opportunity
643058 they say yeah sure but let some other fathers daughter do it
643059 i pass by the tables of other athletes in the olympic canteen and i think ooh the gymnasts pretty girls arent they
643060 i expect them to win at least three gold medals at these games yes it is a bold prediction but i am sure
643061 they are better now they are coming here as world champions
643062 these guys are motivated and they will do really well they know its not easy if you think you have it easy you get upset
643063 my crystal ball is unfortunately not working very well so ill wait and see where we are but as things positively reflect thats good news
643064 the challenge shes taken on is a considerable one and its important to us that challenge is progressing not at the expense of her long term health but also to see how that performance is progressing in terms of her getting towards good shape to be able to perform
643065 theres a lot of people involved in this theres coaches involved theres medics involved you look down you sit down and you say where are we do you feel youre capable of doing yourself justice
643066 when youve got athletes who have got a record of past achievement of past performance theyre not going to put themselves in the line if theyre not in the shape to perform
643067 when something like that happens in your life its just seared into your memory
643068 you live thinking that you were put up for adoption because i burned down my house you blame yourself
643069 i had a very interesting childhood and it has made me a very determined and motivated person
643070 if i do in fact win the gold it will definitely be the icing on the cake
643071 my mom gave me a hug and then walks down the stairs
643072 three people then walked up behind me grabbed me pulled me back into the orphanage
643073 i was like whats going on why is my mom driving away then she came back in three days and i thought we were back together
643074 but instead of giving me a hug she told me to go into this room and play i realised after a few hours she had left again and they were splitting up me and my brother
643075 they were sticklers for education i didnt know how to spell my name i couldnt count read anything i was essentially a blank slate at five years old
643076 they were like if you dont make good grades you cant play sports i spent a lot of my elementary school years staying home studying
643077 i owe a lot of where i am to my adoptive parents i couldnt imagine having a lot of the opportunities today without them
643078 make the most of every day because i am living a dream right now
643079 i get to travel around the world throwing a shot put ball and get paid for it
643080 i have been able to make a life for myself and my wife
643081 if i had to give this up tomorrow i can say i had a great career and i have touched the lives of more people than i can ever imagine
643082 my love for the 100 freestyle is that big that unfortunately i am forced to adjust my ambitions
643083 i am no longer the young god of sydney 2000 i am someone in his 30s who has to use his resources sparingly
643084 i know i should be able to get a medal on the 200m freestyle as except for michael phelps i measure up to everyone else
643085 she is going to have a whole collection of those plaques
643086 i like to volunteer and help out in the eat stand
643087 but i really liked walking in the parade and handing out candy to the kids
643088 i just wanted to represent west lafayette and tell people how great it is
643089 she doesnt get to get out much because her allergies are so bad so we wanted to come and have some fun
643090 she is homeschooled so i try to bring her to compete in contests to learn everything is a learning experience for us
643091 by the time i pay my bills rent gas electric water phone theres nothing left
643092 day care and gas would use up a lot of what i made
643093 i do feel sorry for families who are trying to get by
643094 were trying to plan for his retirement which with things the way they are may or may not happen
643095 gas is too high i get by but i just take it one day at a time thats all i can do
643096 my job was in millersburg and with gas prices so high i couldnt afford to make the trip any more
643097 its just really hard to find a job around here
643098 the parade will be one more chance for them to show off their car
643099 sometimes the smaller the venue the more up close and personal it is so it can actually be better than some of the bigger venues you play for us a show is a show it doesnt matter to us it can be on a smaller stage or a big stage as long as theres people there watching us play were going to go out and do our thing
643100 i think hes young and energetic he is coming on the scene with probably a little bit different style than some of them
643101 as we meet our country is in the sixth year of a two front war our economy is struggling our planet is in peril these challenges and many others demand new leadership
643102 senator clinton has worked to ensure that the democratic platform will represent the concerns of working families in america today the collaborative effort between clinton staff and the obama campaign has been positive and productive and we look forward to continuing to review the platform as it develops
643103 if you want to say invisible americans i think obama was supportive of issues for the invisible americans if you will from the beginning
643104 with a name like that it used to be good
643105 throughout its history the ownership of the white lily brand has changed hands numerous times
643106 since we acquired the white lily brand our primary goal has been to restore and return the brands historic standard of excellence
643107 further there have been no changes to the product specifications or milling process
643108 when we have the opportunity to reassure the white lily consumer that theres been no formulation change theyve been kind of calmed
643109 the anti saloon leaguers essentially put westerville on the map as the dry capital of the world
643110 i always hated the idea of dan rather appearing on my tv someday and saying well the dry capital of the world went wet
643111 people dont like to go out to eat unless they can have a beer with a pizza or wine with spaghetti
643112 we dont currently have a barbershop quartet in coshocton county
643113 we are trying to bring it back to the community and also raise money for the park fund
643114 they are playing fall football in the park and they are currently using the cornfield we need to get these kids a bathroom
643115 we try to get three barbershop quartets to come and perform each year
643116 i think they are great i love music and harmony
643117 i have always said that if i had to be stranded on an island i hope it would be with someone who could harmonize

643124 what i am opposed to is the cynical attempt by richard perle and paul wolfowitz and other arm chair weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne
643125 the world and the iraqi people would be better off without him but i also know that saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history
643126 we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states

643137 it is certainly very difficult to find out the true motions of individual bodies and actually to differentiate them from apparent motions because the parts of that immovable space in which the bodies truly move make no impression on the senses nevertheless the case is not utterly hopeless for it is possible to draw evidence partly from apparent motions which are the differences between the true motions and partly from the forces that are the causes and effects of the true motions
643138 oh someone sure likes transformers are these for your little fan at home
643139 i think it is important that we begin with a demonstration of the ancients majesty and power so that each of you can appreciate their history and ours we shall take our class at the schools caverns to the north of here this will mean
643140 that those of you who settled down in such a short time will have to unsettle
643141 surely did theyre fevered up there and honestly i think crown has caught the same feverdream letting one down here well be murdered in my beds you mark me
643142 crowns more a man than you and without him or his clan the twinned clans wouldnt be at all youre calling that a feverdream
643143 everyones surely better off under the thumb of the crown clan but his intentions now
643144 a place where the sick are taken to away from their families and their shamans a way of giving rule to whoever asks for it and this
643145 you are representatives of your clans and adults besides you should not be squabbling like animals over food and you should not be using violence to present your ideals
643146 our path is nearly at an end so i will thank all of you to be silent until we arrive
643147 on my grave if we must sit here any longer well rot
643148 i do like to start my classes with some excitement i find you all get terribly bored otherwise
643149 but this was no idle amusement there is much we do not know of the ancients so if any of you intend to learn of them at some point you will have to visit their ruins underground if you cannot respond with haste if you are not ready or able to fight you will find the world underground a very dangerous place as well as the world aboveground i expect

643193 weve got theories weve been talking to police and experts in all different fields family spokesman glenn tunstead told abc radio last week
643194 the difficulty is every theory ends up in a dead end or a point where it becomes ridiculous and theres no sort of factual information to back up you know to make that theory have any substance and thats the difficulty of the whole thing

643212 i just want to say that everything has been resolved and i will be back out to work on tuesday
643213 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
643214 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
643215 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
643216 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
643217 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest

643228 like kate and gerry mccann ive had dealings with the portuguese police
643229 but unlike kate and gerry i was only trying to report a burglary not the theft of my child
643230 one of the things obvious to anyone dealing with the police on the algarve is the sorry fact that no matter what you have lost there simply isnt enough of them to begin tracking it down
643231 that may be one of the worst twists of fate in what happened to madeleine that tragically she went missing in the wrong place
643232 eamonn was looking forward to his holiday and cant believe this has happened to him
643233 the only reason he brought so much cash is because he didnt want to use his credit card every time the kids needed some money
643234 hes not very happy because he was staying a top quality hotel and his family could quite easily
643235 police are investigating a burglary in the villa moura area and enquiries are continuing
643236 we never expected anything like this to happen it was awful
643237 not only was our dream holiday ruined but this man made off with valuables which were of sentimental value
643238 please dont hate me dad i will return one day not just yet im in trouble money wise and i need to save up that money that i had taken from you
643239 if you have any love left for me at all can you pay off my credit card debts
643240 i know this isnt the ideal method of communication that you deserve give mum and the rest of the family my love
643241 you felt guilty when you didnt need to you thought we were all mad at you for doin what you wanted
643242 get some rest ill give my love to the skies
643243 i hope you are free from the torment you must have been feeling
643244 ill miss you man nights out will never be the same without you you were the coolest guy id met in years i still cant get my head around the fact that your not here rest in peace man well all see you again sometime
643245 friend in a million im so sorry we werent there for you we both are but im glad we got to see you that night it was such a good night we all couldnt stop laughing it was more than coincidence we were meant to ask yous down that night heres hoping you can see us now and know how much we appreciated having you while we did
643246 ive just came back from a holiday and we turned on the news and saw that another young guy was stabbed in london
643247 its disgusting and disgraceful that so many young people are being murdered whether its with knives or anything else something needs to be done about it everybody knows that something really has to be done to sort it out once and for all
643248 picture something better for your life dont settle for second best find yourself a good hobby and good friends go and make a career for yourself look at yourself as someone who is up and coming in the world who is going to have a good long successful life
643249 westlife are not a political band but if theres anything we can do to help we would
643250 we would sign our name to anything that helps sort out this mess we would help with any worthy campaign that is for a good cause and this is something we think is worthy
643251 we are simple people its going to be a simple occasion and we will have good tunes playing all the time
643252 i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to do something different
643253 louis is going to be involved in the record label and all the decision making this is my first project outside westlife
643254 its going to be more a case of finding real talent and taking them away without anybody seeing them before launching them as the next big girl band i think going down the reality tv line is probably a bit common at the minute i think to try and do what were doing on tv would just get lost and thats not necessary how we want to do it we want to find the next big irish girl band
643255 we havent has a lot of time off but we have seen quite a bit of northern ireland and i have really enjoyed it
643256 i particularly loved the giants causeway and the carrick a rede rope bridge everyone has had a real laugh on set and they have been a great crew to work with
643257 the cast on this film are very young but they have been great fun to work with as they are full of enthusiasm its been fun kitting the characters out and looking for outfits for these streetwise kids to wear
643258 it was certainly an unusual request but we were delighted to help out
643259 basically they were looking for a house to have as a base for some of their scenes and a street as a background and our site at railway court on york road fitted their bill
643260 it certainly created a bit of excitement in the street this week and we will all be looking forward to seeing the film though we will probably not recognise our wee house when we see it
643261 someone who has never lost their child will never understand this kind of pain
643262 it is like a knife through my heart when its raining i wonder if he is getting wet when its cold i wonder if he is shivering i dont know how he is feeling is he calling someone else mummy and daddy is he dreaming of us
643263 i used to joke when he was naughty that id send him away or sell him now that hes gone he probably thinks that i meant it hell be saying mummy ill be good ill be good
643264 its torture we dont know if our child is dead or alive is he being fed is he being beaten is he being looked after is he at school
643265 we think of him every day when we close our eyes in bed at night we think of him when we see other peoples children we think of him we really miss him
643266 every mother assumes she will be with her child for ever but soon she will be growing up in another family as a mother i really want to watch her grow every day with me but i know thats not possible
643267 however hard our life is we would never want the boy to be adopted we wish we could have him back
643268 i thought she would lead me to the gang who stole my son
643269 they told me to stop following her i was punched and kicked unconscious i went to the police with the information but they did nothing then i got an even worse beating when news filtered back about going to the police
643270 four men cornered me close to my home i got stabbed five times in the ribs my husband found me unconscious in a pool of blood
643271 they left me for dead but my husband and i would gladly trade our lives for information that would lead to the return of my son
643272 we are all just devastated at the minute and cant believe this has happened
643273 stephen was just a normal fella who enjoyed life this is a terrible tragedy we would like to thank everyone who helped search for him
643274 its still early days and we dont know what has happened yet were just shocked
643275 a mans body was found near the charles grime bridge by a man on a boat
643276 a post mortem examination will now be carried out to establish the cause of death
643277 i heard about this and i just cant believe it i know the family well and the entire village is just in absolute shock
643278 stephen went out to australia for a great experience and you never expect anything like this to happen
643279 he was a great lad and im sure the village will stand in solidarity with the family at this tragic time
643280 theyve told me that im a miracle case and and the injuries i sustained would prove fatal 99 9 times out of 100
643281 i dont consider myself some sort of hero and i cant remember much about the shooting but there was no way i was going to miss my brothers wedding
643282 he has been there for me so it was only fair i worked tirelessly to be there for him on his big day i redoubled my efforts in rehab to make sure i could walk for a short distance yesterday
643283 the only thing i can remember is that i was talking to another squaddie at the time and if my head hadnt been turned to the left then the bullet would have went straight through my eye and killed me
643284 i dont want to elaborate to much on this because its personal but it has been very hard since my wife left me
643285 i dont know her reasons but i cant dwell on this too much because i have a huge fight ahead of me
643286 its a shame this has happened and my family are naturally upset for me but theres nothing i can do about it now
643287 it was a number of weeks before i was sent home and if things werent bad enough i contracted tb and a form of mrsa when i was being treated in pakistan
643288 i was told that because the wound on my head was so open i was susceptible to infection i couldnt believe what was going on
643289 my parents josie and frank were at their wits end when i was away and im sure they thought they had lost me i just couldnt believe i survived the shooting when the medics described where the round had passed
643290 i was out for weeks and it was just great to get home again to see my family again
643291 i cant complain because ive no right to be alive in all honesty
643292 im still wheelchair bound at the moment but im getting up on feet more and more these days i can slowly feel the paralysis down my left side easing
643293 its frustrating sometimes that things take time to heal but i know i face a long road road to recovery
643294 i have great family and medical staff around me so im confident i can get better in the months ahead
643295 my father served his country with pride and i had no problem following in his footsteps because it was the only job for me
643296 im not bitter about what happened because i was just doing my job i know i could have been killed but i wouldnt change anything about my time in rir
643297 if i had to do it all over again i would when you pull on that uniform you know the risks involved but it doesnt stop you doing your job
643298 ive loved my time in the rir and if that taliban bullet hadnt entered my head then i would still be out there today
643299 the rir have been absolutely fantastic to me and my family if it wasnt for their excellent medical staff then i wouldnt be here today
643300 i know i face a long road to recovery but when i have these amazing people helping me then it makes me more determined to make it
643301 the facility at headley court is one of the best in the world and there are other soldiers worse off than me receiving treatment who will tell you the same thing
643302 they are a credit to the rir because they take care of the officers who have just returned from the field as soon as you come through the door the level of care they provide is fantastic
643303 there are many soldiers from northern ireland receiving treatment at this centre and their level of bravery just amazes me every single day
643304 i would like to extend best wishes to the boys and girls in iraq and afghanistan they are doing a fantastic job
643305 they are putting their lives on the line on a daily basis in order to help people who have been living under brutal regimes
643306 i sometimes dont think they get the credit they deserve and i think about them every day i just wish i was fit enough to be with them
643307 at the moment im just trying to get my independence back and then i will take it from there im now walking short distances with the aid of a zimmer frame and i have just been taking it each day as it comes for the last two years
643308 i know i wont be on the frontline again but if i can still have an association with the rir then this would be great
643309 i dont want young men to be worried about joining because of what happened to me because the experiences ive had over the years will live with me forever
643310 towards the late 1980s we got into trouble with the bank and the ulster bank were putting pressure on the trustees i went to patrick duffy to see what could be
643311 he said to me we will not let the club go
643312 i could have walked on air as i went home that night
643313 paddy duffy had done a lot of good work he was a pillar of the community and would have liked to have seen the club saved i thought
643314 one day i was in the club and fr seamus rice came in and said he had bought the club from paddy duffy this was about 1996 he was not long in the parish at the time
643315 i told him it could not have been sold and he told me not to worry
643316 the late patrick duffy solicitor made arrangements to discharge the loan which did seem to involve the property being at one time owned by a company of which his sons were directors however the premises seem to have been passed back to the parish and to have changed hands several times since then
643317 there was a considerable amount of contact with mr gervin and the inference being created that the plaintiff gervin has in some way been hoodwinked is completely without basis and strongly rejected
643318 be very very careful be very careful until you have your true story and your facts right its a very dangerous topic you are on
643319 the owner of clonoe boxing club is a man called johnny cavanagh and he is the man to talk to
643320 the people who owned the club sold it to him a man called paddy duffy he owned the club and sold it to johnny cavanagh
643321 coalisland parish had no role in it other than to support it the boxing club was bought over by pa duffy and co and sold it in turn to johnny cavanagh
643322 so be very very careful paddy duffy is one of the highest solicitors in northern ireland and be very very careful what you put in the paper
643323 theres not a person would ever let paddy duffy down so be extremely careful what you put in the paper as regards something that paddy duffy owns be very very careful
643324 legal proceedings were initiated by francis gervin initially in dungannon county court and transferred to the high court in belfast the plaintiff francis gervins claim was dismissed by the high court chancery master and francis gervin appealed this decision to the high court judge
643325 francis gervins claim was dismissed again by the high court on the 7th april 2008 francis gervin is still dissatisfied
643326 a loving daughter sister friend and soulmate from ma da sean stephen gerald and anne marie we love you pet and will miss you
643327 jean valued her friends enormously and maintained bonds of friendship all throughout her life
643328 jean liked people she was thoughtful towards others she would do people a good turn and would help out whoever she could
643329 alongside that she was a lively young person who enjoyed the craic she was game for a laugh and would do anything for a joke and in company she was the life and soul of the party
643330 you just feel so helpless and even though youre not responsible you think theres something you could have done to stop it
643331 the vigils helped to get rid of the fear anger and frustration
643332 you feel like youre doing something to help the wee children and thats one of the reasons we started this fund
643333 we raised 750 in one night the children couldnt even get into their house to get their clothes because it was sealed off
643334 the whole street is frightened its like something you see on tv after the vigil i came home and lay on the bed and cried its heartbreaking
643335 when i saw his picture in the paper i felt sick
643336 hes a maniac and ive said for years that people like him dont change
643337 i thought i had moved on but when something like this happens it just brings it all back
643338 he nearly killed me that time and i knew i had to get out before i ended up dead
643339 when we first got together he was so charming all my friends thought he was wonderful
643340 but he started beating me when i was pregnant and it just got worse
643341 i could tell by his eyes when he was going to start he had the most evil eyes
643342 when i had aimee he told me i wasnt allowed to go and visit my catholic friends
643343 my heart goes out to that poor girl jean god love those wee wains
643344 he left lynne for dead and he didnt even know her
643345 i said at the time when he only got five years that he should have got far longer
643346 i believe he should have got a life sentence for what he did to me and lynne
643347 there should be some mental health checks in place for people like him he should have been assessed at the end of his jail sentence instead of being let back out onto the streets
643348 ill have to tell aimee about what is happening she and her friends watch the tv they see the papers and its better coming from me than someone else
643349 i will always be fearful of him but ive tried to get on with my life both for my sake and aimees

643365 ze moest nou eenmaal mee naar dat feest bij haar oma volgens mij is dat echt een nachtmerrie
643366 ja vorige keer moest ze telkens met de hapjes rond en op de kleintjes van al haar tantes passen en dat zijn er nogal wat ze mocht zelf ook geen hapjes nemen alleen rondbrengen en toch praat ze altijd best positief over haar oma maar misschien is dat gewoon omdat het haar oma is die alleen lief voor haar was toen ze klein was

643374 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
643375 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
643376 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
643377 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
643378 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
643379 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
643380 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
643381 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
643382 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
643383 who are open to doing something on the production side
643384 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
643385 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
643386 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

643391 la globalizaci n tiene sus ventajas pero tambi n sus inconvenientes y sus peligros la gente de san quirico no sabe que est corriendo un riesgo en estados unidos
643392 tuve el fallo de enviarlo a un par de amigos uno de ellos me contest que le gust y que se lo enviaba a otro par de amigos y ah se me fue de las manos
643393 lo escrib porque iba leyendo cosas sueltas todo est copiado y lo nico es que a veces pongo comentarios
643394 la globalizaci n tiene sus ventajas pero tambi n sus inconvenientes y sus peligros
643395 cuando la gente dice que si el crack del 29 fue mejor o peor que ste digo que ste es peor porque all se hundi la bolsa americana y cu nta gente de san quirico ten as acciones en la bolsa americana cero
643396 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
643397 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
643398 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
643399 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
643400 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
643401 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
643402 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
643403 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
643404 what would be the equivalent wardrobe for wintertime for a pear shape if you are a pear what do you wear in the fall winter my life is super casual and i walk to just about everything so ease and comfort are key
643405 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
643406 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
643407 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
643408 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
643409 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
643410 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
643411 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
643412 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
643413 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
643414 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
643415 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
643416 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
643417 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
643418 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
643419 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
643420 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
643421 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
643422 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
643423 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
643424 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
643425 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
643426 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
643427 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
643428 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
643429 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
643430 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
643431 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
643432 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
643433 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
643434 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
643435 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
643436 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
643437 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
643438 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
643439 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
643440 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
643441 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
643442 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
643443 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
643444 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
643445 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
643446 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
643447 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
643448 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
643449 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
643450 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
643451 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
643452 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
643453 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
643454 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
643455 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
643456 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
643457 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
643458 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
643459 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
643460 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
643461 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
643462 ah caio mas esse blog de viadinho blog de etiqueta
643463 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
643464 we have to have these conversations about race and class
643465 everybody is nervous that in a political campaign we get reduced to slogans and the narrowest of slogans so that you dont get good discussions
643466 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
643467 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
643468 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
643469 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
643470 the federal bureau of investigation and the intelligence community were the ones who were most concerned about it
643471 en gutsy durante el boot en vez de logo ubuntu y barra avance
643472 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
643473 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
643474 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
643475 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
643476 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
643477 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
643478 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
643479 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
643480 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
643481 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
643482 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
643483 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
643484 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
643485 i remember the next morning my friend looked in her wallet and said oh apparently i spent 165 buying three rounds of shots for everybody
643486 back home theyre just run of the mill cubicle people
643487 but here theyre like three parts kimora simmons and two parts oasis circa 1995

643489 sometimes you feel like its going to become a situation where they stop and take a picture look at that endangered species a native new yorker with a briefcase going to work
643490 had made such massive purchases that we couldnt get anyone to give us the time of day for our size 11 ferragamo party slippers

643494 this is a particularly opportune moment for such a venture here at glasgow as we have an outstanding group of scholars who have both the academic credentials required for such an edition and the imagination and passion for burns to produce something truly spectacular which will be a lasting monument in textual and cultural scholarship
643495 it will establish burns for the 21st century and illuminate corners of his life and work and their afterlives never brought to light before

643553 we saw it in the ashes when england beat us at home it can benefit you
643554 obviously you need things to go your way and people fit going into it but for the moment we are going to enjoy this
643555 in the bigger picture all the players that have come before us and given it their all and lost out we were part of 2003 with that drawn series and the many people who havent had the opportunity in years past and the fans i can imagine what its like for them
643556 so for us it is bigger than just a cricket game it was a huge moment
643557 for those guys that have felt pain in a couple of series it obviously means a lot
643558 it has been a bit sore but i am thankful i got on the field now
643559 i was feeling a bit doubtful before the game and was on a few painkillers throughout
643560 getting in here was going to be the main challenge for me and jimmy anderson bowled well with the new ball and put me under pressure
643561 i knew if we got close things could start to happen and we just needed a partnership
643562 obviously the ashes 2005 went through my mind because it was so similar
643563 then it came down to whether to take the extra half hour and it came into my head again
643564 fred was the one that could really exploit it in the game
643565 there were a couple of batters who struggled with it but it was something we couldnt control
643566 before we knew it we were 93 for four due to some good deliveries sight screen issues or whatever it was
643567 we were in trouble but i couldnt really control that for me it was just important to focus on my own game and hope someone would bat with me
643568 i knew if i could keep going i would get us close and then england might get desperate try a few things and give us a few free deliveries
643569 shes fine she ran a really good race and we were pleased
643570 she could go for the yorkshire oaks now or there is a group two at deauville that is also a possibility

643589 for a certain percentage of patients at our office it helps people get it done
643590 but if people stop to think oral health is so prevention oriented keep those regular preventive appointments down the road that can really save money
643591 we have seen an increase in the number of patients with emergency needs
643592 in the last six to 10 months i felt were being inundated
643593 weve seen a huge increase in people whove had dental insurance but are in a new situation because theyre uninsured now and they didnt know where they needed to go
643594 there are 400 people a week we cant get in as patients

643599 in general i always tell my patients were here to keep you healthy not everyone can afford all the work and will put things off
643600 its so new to us were still very much a cottage industry and the patients want a dental home
643601 in a dental emergency i think people want a relationship with their dentists
643602 its hard to do a procedure correctly and still keep costs low and keep your practice going
643603 even a lot of the referrals out to orthopedics have diminished
643604 if a family has three or four kids who need braces people are putting that on hold
643605 emergency dentistry is booming when people put off maintenance it usually results in an extraction
643606 its all about doing whats best for them and theres always the financial aspect
643607 were moving more toward a wellness model preserving teeth and being proactive
643608 as members of the baby boom generation advance into middle age a large number will need complicated dental work such as bridges
643609 in addition elderly people are more likely to retain their teeth than were their predecessors so they will require much more care than in the past

643614 how big still is the amazon rain forest in brazil
643615 when i told him that it amounted to almost 40 per cent of brazils total territory he became sad
643616 my goodness i had no idea they had destroyed that much what is there now a sand dune
643617 thank you in japanese in brazil the only language is portuguese only isolated populations will speak native languages but nobody in a city knows that language we are proud of our language unity
643618 during a recent discussion in the united states someone asked my opinion regarding the internationalization of the amazon region the youngster asserted that he expected a response of a humanist and not of a brazilian this was the first time anyone had established the humanist viewpoint as the starting point for my response in fact as a brazilian i would have responded simply against internationalization of the amazon region even if our governments have not given the attention that this treasure deserves it is ours i responded that as a humanist realizing the risk of environmental destruction that threatens the amazon region i could imagine its internationalization just as for everything else that is important to humanity if the amazon region from a humanists point of view has to be internationalized then we should internationalize the oil reserves of the entire the world as well oil is just as important to the well being of humanity as the amazon region for our future nevertheless the owners of oil reserves feel it is in their right to increase or decrease oil production and to raise or lower the price the rich of the world feel they have the right to burn this valuable possession of humanity similarly the financial capital of the wealthy nations should be internationalized if the amazon region is a natural reserve for every human being then it could not be burned down by the decision of a landowner or a country to burn down the amazon region is so tragic as the unemployment provoked by the arbitrary decisions of world wide speculators we cannot permit that the worlds financial reserves serve to burn down entire nations according to the whims of speculation before the internationalization of the amazon region i would like to see the internationalization of all the worlds great museums the lourve cannot belong only to france each museum in the world is a guardian for the most beautiful works produced by the human genius it cannot be permitted that these cultural possessions as the natural possession of the amazon region can be manipulated or be destroyed according to the whims of an owner or a country recently a japanese millionaire decided to have a painting of a grand master buried with him in the grave this painting should have been internationalized at the time of the meeting in which this question came up the united nations convened the forum of the millennium and the presidents of several countries had difficulties in attending due to barriers they faced at the border therefore i contend that new york as the base of the united nations should be internationalized at least manhattan should belong to all of humanity similarly paris venice rome london rio de janeiro brasilia recife every city with its own beauty its own history should belong to the whole world if the united states wants to internationalize the amazon region due to the risk of leaving it in brazilian hands then we should internationalize all the nuclear stockpiles of the united states particularly since they have already shown that they are capable of using these weapons causing destruction thousands of times greater than the sad fires taken place in the brazilian forests during their debates the current u s presidential candidates have defended the idea of internationalizing the world forest reserves in exchange for the debt we could begin to use this debt to guarantee the right of every child in the world to attend school we could internationalize the children treating all of them regardless of their birthplace as a possession which deserves the care and attention of the entire world even more so than the amazon region when the world leaders attend to the worlds poor children as possessions of humanity they will no longer permit that these children work when they should be studying that they die when they should be living as a humanist i accept to defend the internationalization of the world so long as the world treats me as a brazilian i will fight so that our amazon region will be ours and only ours

643642 i am passing this message on to gb not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
643643 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future

643645 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end
643646 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
643647 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
643648 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
643649 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
643650 whoever gets the job will need a bit of time to establish themselves as the leader
643651 it is conformation for me that she is making good progress
643652 well have a look weve given her the space and the time that i think her performance level deserves well see her get here and again well be watching progress and see what happens thats what weve been doing all the way through
643653 i am more optimistic as time goes on my crystal ball is unfortunately not working very well so ill wait and see where we are but as things positively progress thats good news
643654 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
643655 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
643656 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
643657 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
643658 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
643659 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
643660 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
643661 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
643662 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
643663 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
643664 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory

643676 it is still a fair bit away and australia is a different challenge all together
643677 but it is just nice to have the confidence of a victory like this
643678 we saw it in the ashes when england beat us at home it can benefit you
643679 obviously you need things to go your way and people fit going into it but for the moment we are going to enjoy this
643680 in the bigger picture all the players that have come before us and given it their all and lost out we were part of 2003 with that drawn series and the many people who havent had the opportunity in years past and the fans i can imagine what its like for them
643681 so for us it is bigger than just a cricket game it was a huge moment
643682 for those guys that have felt pain in a couple of series it obviously means a lot
643683 it has been a bit sore but i am thankful i got on the field now
643684 i was feeling a bit doubtful before the game and was on a few painkillers throughout
643685 getting in here was going to be the main challenge for me and jimmy anderson bowled well with the new ball and put me under pressure
643686 i knew if we got close things could start to happen and we just needed a partnership
643687 obviously the ashes 2005 went through my mind because it was so similar
643688 then it came down to whether to take the extra half hour and it came into my head again
643689 fred was the one that could really exploit it in the game
643690 there were a couple of batters who struggled with it but it was something we couldnt control
643691 before we knew it we were 93 for four due to some good deliveries sight screen issues or whatever it was
643692 we were in trouble but i couldnt really control that for me it was just important to focus on my own game and hope someone would bat with me
643693 i knew if i could keep going i would get us close and then england might get desperate try a few things and give us a few free deliveries

643741 we book them dinners and shopping trips we imagine what they might want to see at the theatre and we book them tickets
643742 we organise dress alterations sightseeing tours and if theyve got kids with them we organise kids activities weve even been asked at the last minute to find hair extensions for a big name star who refused to leave her hotel room to come down to the premiere until we got them we went all around london through every hairdresser until we found the right colour those kind of requests stretch you
643743 they say they want to go to a club and youve had to make sure youve made reservations in three clubs in case they want to go to one of them

643836 he the prophet used to recite the chapter slowly so much so that it would be longer than chapters that were actually longer than it
643837 in the name of allaah the most gracious the most merciful

643842 do not scatter the recitation of quraan out like the scattering of sand and do not rush through it like the hasty recitation of poetry stop at its amazing parts and make your heart move with it none of you should let his concern be to reach the end of the chapter
643843 a man came to ibn mas ud and said i read the mufassal chapters from qaf to an nas last night in one unit of prayer ibn mas ud said this is rushing like the haste of reciting poetry verily i know the pairs of chapters that the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam used to combine between them in prayer then he mentioned twenty chapters from the mufassal chapters and said that the prophet sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam used to recite two in each unit
643844 in the early days after us independence corporations were chartered by state legislatures for specific purposes if a corporation did not fulfill its public purpose it was put out of business and the state took back the charter
643845 democracy cant exist where corporations are exercising all the same rights as citizens they suck all the air out of the room and were stuck for example with corporations that use the right to remain silent to conceal harmful product ingredients and use the right of free speech to bury election opponents under an avalanche of corporate money

643856 the economy of any country is nothing but a reflection of its sense of what is possible and what is right
643857 there is something called fiscal discipline that should be always present in any form of organized society be that a humble home in the outskirts or a powerful nation like the in the last few years our fiscal discipline has been shattered by the lack of sensible measures to avoid abuses such as those that have become doctrine in the real estate sector the glaring example is that of the mortgage guarantees that at this date exceed three trillion dollars trillions my friend
643858 a peculiar development while there is a clear distaste for the term socialism we are looking at a clear socialistic measure when the government intervenes and has to assume a three trillion dollar responsibility for which it will have to set down a number of measures that will affect futures generations state control no less the situation is indeed critical all you have to worry about at this point is to make sure that your income exceeds the obligations you have and above all avoid borrowing from any bank or established institution if funds are needed make a deal with uncle mortimer or sell one of the picassos you have in your apartment
643859 what is all this jazz about liquidity crisis solvency instability debt valuation and convertibility and inspired mumbo jumbo about the sub prime predatory lending running wild and all of it lacking some form of rational regulations
643860 it is simply the result of an irresponsible enthusiasm that has gripped this country since the year 2000 invading a country and calling it a war is part of the background it had added a heavy load to the economic well being of the country this state of confusion and lack of mature guidance by the entire government has fed this optimism when it should have tightened regulations and punished abuses no wonder you see so many millionaires these days it has been a period where doubtful deals could be made under the nose of a helpless and incompetent government bent on a fantasy of keeping the rich richer in the hopes that some of the wealth would eventually reach the needy sectors i agree that wealth must be protected as it is a key ingredient and raw material of our economy but to promote it at the cost of social services corporate abuse and the helpless plight of 50 million poor beings is just too much

643882 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
643883 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
643884 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks
643885 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country

643901 are demanding the same kind of respect as their male counterparts
643902 regular readers will recall that in the case of colorado springs i pointed out the obvious contradiction between claiming to believe the bible literally since the bible includes an injunction to turn the other cheek and the readiness to shoot back at those who attack us i figured you cant have it both ways either you believe in turning the other cheek or you believe in self defense you cant declare that you accept every word of the bible as perfectly true and then thank god for steadying your hand when you shoot somebody

643936 largely as a result of san franciscos self imposed sanctuary status
643937 verification of income must be pursued under all names and social security numbers during the application review process
643938 the methods used to calculate benefits must be based upon data that will yield the most accurate financial information
643939 when an applicant states they have a legal presence in the u s the applicant should provide documents that show their current immigration status
643940 a save inquiry is done using the alien number that is on the provided document
643941 if the secondary verification is returned from save stating the document appears false the immigration status cannot be determined
643942 considered as an unqualified immigrant and is ineligible to receive benefits for themselves
643943 not a finding of fact or conclusion of law that the individual is lawfully present in the u s
643944 if it is known an immigrant has an unlawful presence in the u s
643945 an agency only knows if an individual is in the country unlawfully if the immigrant gives the agency documentary evidence such as a final order for deportation
643946 must be completed only if an individual has willfully and knowingly misstated
643947 provided incorrect or misleading information to obtain or attempt to obtain benefits for which the individual is not eligible
643948 referral for prosecution will be initiated by the county department of social services for cases in which the department has sufficient documentary evidence
643949 this process applies to individuals that received benefits and not to individuals where immigration and citizen status is the issue all rules of confidentiality must be applied in regards to citizenship and immigration status
643950 there were no changes to the eligibility standards that were included in the 2002 farm bill
643951 legal immigrants can qualify under snap for assistance illegal immigrants do not qualify under any circumstances
643952 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
643953 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
643954 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
643955 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
643956 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
643957 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
643958 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
643959 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
643960 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
643961 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
643962 the public thinks that this company hires anybody off the street doesnt care if theyre legal or illegal and that we know nothing about them
643963 well they got a drivers license issued by the state of rhode island and they got a social security card issued apparently by the social security administration if those things are fraudulent well thats the criminals fault not the employer
643964 other than have an immigration officer here every day i dont know what else i can do
643965 of course its not our fault it was an issue of their having to verify their payroll of employees versus their independent contractors
643966 from an industry standpoint we do see employers from time to time try to avoid having employees because it is less costly for them
643967 youll avoid paying insurance youll avoid paying payroll tax and any benefits you pass on to them
643968 management company billing agent for a number of franchisees subcontractors
643969 these individuals are more often than not husbands and wives who operate their own cleaning companies
643970 they are all individual business owners who have their own customers as well as the customers that deci inc sells to them
643971 dwc 11 1c form declaring himself herself to be an independent contractor and waiving any and all rights to workers compensation and its benefits
643972 the right to have all checks and other forms of remittance for services performed by the individual endorsed to deci
643973 nowhere in the cleaning contract is there an indication that the cleaning is performed by independent third party contractors
643974 were caused by the failure of tristate to clean the floor in a reasonable prudent manner or to warn tenants their employees and others of the wet slippery condition of the floor adjacent to the ladies room or properly supervise its employees
643975 not the employer of any individual who may have cleaned the premises
643976 no one can force you to sign this form when you sign this form you are stating that you are an independent contractor and in the event of injury are not entitled to workers compensation
643977 pay our taxes we do everything but we cant find a job
643978 we would be employees they were going to put everyone to work that same day thats why they said show up at 5 p m
643979 is critical that employers correctly determine whether workers providing services are employees or independent contractors self employed
643980 there is no magic or set number of factors that makes the worker an employee or an independent contractor and no one factor stands alone in making this determination factors that may be relevant in one situation may not be relevant in another

643982 there have been a couple moments in these first four exhibition games when chris paul fell asleep on defense though he certainly has made up for it at the offensive end
643983 that is poor defense by carmelo anthony he is not a good on ball defender
643984 you almost sense in this game that these guys are ready to get to beijing more so than in any other game they are pretty much going through the motions
643985 i fought for recognition of martin luther king day in my state sadly its not true
643986 i believe that barry goldwater to start with regretted his vote on the 1964 civil rights act
643987 i think that barry grew like all of us grow and evolve in 1983 when i was brand new in the congress i voted against the recognition of dr martin luther king that was a mistake ok and later i had the chance to help fight for the recognition of dr martin luther king as a holiday in my state
643988 to prohibit federal financing for the martin luther king jr federal holiday commission
643989 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
643990 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
643991 el objetivo es que m s instituciones se sumen a esta iniciativa que permite un claro ahorro de recursos tanto al empleador como a sus funcionarios
643992 we know that once consumers start watching their favorite tv shows in high definition their viewing habits change and their preference switches to all hd programming
643993 despite all the sound and fury of confusing hd claims from our competitors our customers understand that directv is the destination for the most compelling and complete lineup of hd content
643994 any day is a good day to break out that special beer
643995 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
643996 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
643997 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
643998 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
643999 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
644000 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney
644001 but if youre involved in civil litigation in jeopardy of losing your house or your family what we do is make you go out and find your own attorney
644002 if we gave people the help they needed near the beginning of their problem their problems wouldnt snowball the way they do
644003 hamas raided our family burnt our houses and terrified our children thats why we ran from gaza
644004 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
644005 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
644006 i have never said that marta should be the rail operator for gwinnett i have only said that gwinnett needs rail transit this plan will show us how to get there

644037 its a long shot to get him back for the regular season
644038 hes still not weight bearing on the foot and hell be in a walking boot for another couple weeks well take it week by week and see where he is and hopefully we have him back for october
644039 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
644040 is uneasy until the end of it whether it is possible for honesty a blow like conventional

644043 we stand up with our brothers in these difficult times
644044 this is the time to show unity and consideration regarding the problem
644045 nobody was harmed during the protests yatris were provided ration and tourists were given security
644046 but in jammu the land transfer issue has been solely communalised
644047 we should endorse suggestions for alternate roads like srinagar muzaffarabad road if hindu communalists continue to block the road
644048 we would not tolerate communal polarization of a particular community nor we would bear that members of our community being targeted
644049 theres not a lot of christian functions where people say whos bringing the beer
644050 but god intended us as the beer commercial says to live with gusto its just that we are not to leave god out of the discussion
644051 we are unshakably bible believing jesus loving christians who believe our job is reconciling people together to god and to each other and not drawing them apart
644052 i listened and i said no matter where you are on the issue thats wrong that was a breakthrough
644053 its not a matter of building walls or creating safe havens so we can feel better about ourselves
644054 its about creating an environment where we understand we are participating in the reconciling redemptive work of jesus
644055 god is our audience and our call is to serve and bring people to christ instead of creating division its creating commonality
644056 many are talking less about politics period and more about spiritual nurture in terms of feeding the hungry clothing the naked and being good stewards of gods creation
644057 we proclaim that jesus is our king and is teaching us how to live in the world on the flip side we strongly believe god is neither a republican or a democrat there is a new politic interested in both proclamational truth and social justice
644058 ive seen so many denominations draw lines in the sand
644059 we dont see that as a sin thats any worse than the other sins so youre welcome to worship with us knowing the direction were heading
644060 what were trying to do is say everybody come on in it gets chaotic but theres life here
644061 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
644062 any player going down but a guy like him getting hurt its part of football unfortunately and theres not a play that you dont hold your breath in all honesty you just got to keep pushing through and hope for the best and hopefully its our time to stay healthy weve been pretty fortunate through this camp keep our fingers crossed with him and see what happens
644063 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
644064 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
644065 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
644066 i think theres a lot more runs in me and i think this decision will help that

644073 this is my dream setting i never knew i wanted pitch perfect art with a really atmospheric series of 9 months after 10 months after diary entries warning notices and id papers
644074 i read the game last night and was really captivated
644075 but the simple story driven mechanics emphasis on player input in setting building and quality of what really was there won me over hot war won me over for doing well what it set out to do
644076 this is an absolutely marvelous game that fills me with envy

644091 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
644092 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
644093 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
644094 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
644095 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
644096 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
644097 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
644098 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
644099 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
644100 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
644101 these scammers have been approaching people with this fake gold and have been trying to sell it for a low price which would be very appealing to some people
644102 the counterfeit items are also quite weighty so shoppers may be fooled into thinking it was real
644103 they use a variety of other distraction techniques such as asking for directions and then another family member steals from their bag whilst the shopper is preoccupied
644104 we are asking shoppers to keep their valuables close to them and not to speak to anyone trying to sell gold on the streets and to report it to police as soon as they can
644105 is she from d c did we have drinks with her recently or something

644108 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
644109 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
644110 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
644111 he made friends effortlessly disliked no one and accepted everyone for who they were tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone
644112 he had the most infectious giggle and you could hear him laughing a mile away
644113 this is obviously a most difficult time for us all
644114 i am pleased to say i have good news we have now cleared up all the rubble that was blocking the highway we got in to do gravelling on the highway surface and it will be paved almost immediately were guaranteed to be open by 11 oclock we may even do better than that
644115 there was still a lot of challenging work involved especially with those extremely large boulders they required blasting
644116 fortunately everything went along real quickly the blasting work the final scaling of the rock face wall and they threw a lot of crews and equipment at it and it all fell into place
644117 the whole cleanup has been a combination of a lot of resources throwing everything they have at it
644118 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
644119 forget about the last play during his magical season as the teams head coach
644120 it has been raining for the past four days and we cant expect good weather yet for the next 48 hours or so
644121 its advisable that the public bring rain gear with them to prepare for heavy downpour
644122 i guess my comment just came from the brain i have
644123 if an adult wants to have unrestricted access to the internet they have to pay and get a password from the service provider
644124 this is obviously special for me winning on circuit gilles villeneuve
644125 gilles was a hero of mine i watched him in 1980 or 81 in pouring rain so for me to win here and in the wet this is really special
644126 im going to be pinching myself for the next couple of hours
644127 the conditions were treacherous and there was lots of flooding
644128 i wanted to finish first so bad but i am pretty happy
644129 we had a great car all weekend we wanted one position higher than last year but well come back and try it again
644130 this is what i am saying that milf forces on the ground are getting impatient
644131 but the milf leadership has already sent emissaries for our forces to disengage
644132 if armm election pushes through we cannot stop these people from getting restless
644133 people and children were seen running upon seeing men in fatigue uniforms and armed with rocket propelled grenades
644134 we expect their leaders to discipline their men and give them time to retreat
644135 if not an offensive will be launched to protect the civilians
644136 barring that the issuance of a temporary restraining order by the supreme court its a go presidential adviser on the peace process hermogenes esperon jr said in a phone interview
644137 there is nothing implementable or actionable in the moa the moa on the ancestral domain is but an agreement in one of the main agenda the two others being security and economic matters so there is no final agreement yet ermita said in a phone interview
644138 comprehensive compact of the final peace agreement according to ermita
644139 you cant negotiate without looking at the laws of the country and constitution
644140 all out consultation with stakeholders and all sectors on the contents of the moa preparatory to the plebiscite that would be held a year after the moa signing according to esperon
644141 we will argue that the power of negotiations is with the executive branch said esperon who used to be the armed forces chief of staff prior to his new role as peace adviser
644142 the conduct of negotiations is a function of the executive branch
644143 preliminary agreement and made it clear that the 1987 constitution remained the terms of reference in the peace negotiations
644144 in paragraphs 7 and 8 it stated that nothing will be executory unless there is a law enabling it and everything must be done within the legal framework
644145 any plebiscite will be pursuant only to an enabling law enacted by congress esperon said
644146 thats why i dont think anyone can say that there is a violation and this would be an impeachable offense ermita
644147 political suspicion talks that the president was using the peace pact with the milf to amend the constitution so as to extend her term which ends in 2010
644148 i think we are extending our imagination too much the executive secretary said
644149 all out consultation preparatory to the holding of the plebiscite on the expanded armm
644150 we will then go to mindanao and let the people know about the moa he said
644151 and we are endearing to finish the negotiations and come up with the final peace agreement within 15 months or even earlier he said

644154 i marched last year we were shot at and we had nothing to shoot back with
644155 defrauding his men of their advance pay and by false returns imposing upon the commissary and drawing more rations than he had men in his company and for selling the provisions he by that means obtained
644156 tell me whom you love and i will tell you who you are
644157 what was silent in the father speaks in the son
644158 compare prices brands man is not born to solve the problems of the universe but to find out what he has to do
644159 a pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties
644160 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step only he who keeps his eyes fixed on the far horizon will find the right road
644161 that can mean a three hour trip out of your day just to get the mail
644162 were going to find some scheme that will work for us
644163 people talk about mayo losing finals but you have to ask the question who else lost finals in the lastfour or five years the answer is not too many because they werent there
644164 the fact that mayo have been in finals and in thelatter stages of the league and the championship means they are a quality side
644165 we knew this was a difficult task and a step up from anything that we had faced to date this year it was always going to be a stiff challenge and when we wentthree points down midway through the second half the omens didnt look good
644166 however this team is made of better stuff people cast doubts on them and i can understand that because the results of the last three years dont merit any higher standing
644167 however i think they took back a bit of standing forthemselves today but weve only a week to enjoy it because it could all go out the window again next week
644168 were still not playing well and whoever gets us in the draw will be happy but were happy to cling on and hang in there and hopefully we can step it up
644169 coming off the back of the westmeath game it was always going to be a step up coming up to croke park to play mayo
644170 there is still a hunger in their team and it was a tough test only for an improved 15 minute spell we could be out of the all ireland
644171 results are results and were in the last eight and happy enough to be involved next weekend
644172 michael had always said he wanted to play for linfield and he thought a few things over during the week and decided that he would like to sign for the club
644173 were delighted to have him signed and in time for the season kicking off on saturday
644174 i was pleased with the first half we scored two good goals through glenn and william
644175 however we didnt look incisive at all after the break and i certainly reminded the players that we needed more after the match
644176 overall it was another good 90 minute workout for the players and i certainly feel were ready for the first game of the season on saturday
644177 well thats up to you i have no regrets and ive learnt a lot and im going on
644178 someone who has never lost their child will never understand this kind of pain
644179 it is like a knife through my heart when its raining i wonder if he is getting wet when its cold i wonder if he is shivering i dont know how he is feeling is he calling someone else mummy and daddy is he dreaming of us
644180 i used to joke when he was naughty that id send him away or sell him now that hes gone he probably thinks that i meant it hell be saying mummy ill be good ill be good
644181 its torture we dont know if our child is dead or alive is he being fed is he being beaten is he being looked after is he at school
644182 we think of him every day when we close our eyes in bed at night we think of him when we see other peoples children we think of him we really miss him
644183 every mother assumes she will be with her child for ever but soon she will be growing up in another family as a mother i really want to watch her grow every day with me but i know thats not possible
644184 however hard our life is we would never want the boy to be adopted we wish we could have him back
644185 i thought she would lead me to the gang who stole my son
644186 they told me to stop following her i was punched and kicked unconscious i went to the police with the information but they did nothing then i got an even worse beating when news filtered back about going to the police
644187 four men cornered me close to my home i got stabbed five times in the ribs my husband found me unconscious in a pool of blood
644188 they left me for dead but my husband and i would gladly trade our lives for information that would lead to the return of my son
644189 we are fully focused and have our feet firmly on the ground
644190 we will not be getting carried away and will take one game at a time
644191 it was important for us to get the three points and we certainly did that in style
644192 the boys played extremely well and we scored some superb goals
644193 portadown should not be in this mickey mouse league which doesnt even have linesmen
644194 if portadown had not taken their foot off the pedal with 20 minutes left it could have been double figures
644195 however we will put this result behind us quickly and look forward to the clash with loughgall on tuesday night
644196 sometimes in changing rooms if things havent gone well you just want to pick up your bag and get out as quickly as possible
644197 after the kerry defeat last august we sat for 20 minutes nobody spoke or even moved
644198 we all knew our 2007 championship had run its course
644199 we also knew we had made a major effort and still lost
644200 any side can do without one or even two key players on any given day but if three or four go missing you are in big trouble
644201 we havent has a lot of time off but we have seen quite a bit of northern ireland and i have really enjoyed it
644202 i particularly loved the giants causeway and the carrick a rede rope bridge everyone has had a real laugh on set and they have been a great crew to work with
644203 the cast on this film are very young but they have been great fun to work with as they are full of enthusiasm its been fun kitting the characters out and looking for outfits for these streetwise kids to wear
644204 it was certainly an unusual request but we were delighted to help out
644205 basically they were looking for a house to have as a base for some of their scenes and a street as a background and our site at railway court on york road fitted their bill
644206 it certainly created a bit of excitement in the street this week and we will all be looking forward to seeing the film though we will probably not recognise our wee house when we see it
644207 its just the right time i feel to move forward with a new captain and new direction
644208 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
644209 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsmen i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
644210 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
644211 towards the late 1980s we got into trouble with the bank and the ulster bank were putting pressure on the trustees i went to patrick duffy to see what could be
644212 he said to me we will not let the club go
644213 i could have walked on air as i went home that night
644214 paddy duffy had done a lot of good work he was a pillar of the community and would have liked to have seen the club saved i thought
644215 one day i was in the club and fr seamus rice came in and said he had bought the club from paddy duffy this was about 1996 he was not long in the parish at the time
644216 i told him it could not have been sold and he told me not to worry
644217 the late patrick duffy solicitor made arrangements to discharge the loan which did seem to involve the property being at one time owned by a company of which his sons were directors however the premises seem to have been passed back to the parish and to have changed hands several times since then
644218 there was a considerable amount of contact with mr gervin and the inference being created that the plaintiff gervin has in some way been hoodwinked is completely without basis and strongly rejected
644219 be very very careful be very careful until you have your true story and your facts right its a very dangerous topic you are on
644220 the owner of clonoe boxing club is a man called johnny cavanagh and he is the man to talk to
644221 the people who owned the club sold it to him a man called paddy duffy he owned the club and sold it to johnny cavanagh
644222 coalisland parish had no role in it other than to support it the boxing club was bought over by pa duffy and co and sold it in turn to johnny cavanagh
644223 so be very very careful paddy duffy is one of the highest solicitors in northern ireland and be very very careful what you put in the paper
644224 theres not a person would ever let paddy duffy down so be extremely careful what you put in the paper as regards something that paddy duffy owns be very very careful
644225 legal proceedings were initiated by francis gervin initially in dungannon county court and transferred to the high court in belfast the plaintiff francis gervins claim was dismissed by the high court chancery master and francis gervin appealed this decision to the high court judge
644226 francis gervins claim was dismissed again by the high court on the 7th april 2008 francis gervin is still dissatisfied
644227 like kate and gerry mccann ive had dealings with the portuguese police
644228 but unlike kate and gerry i was only trying to report a burglary not the theft of my child
644229 one of the things obvious to anyone dealing with the police on the algarve is the sorry fact that no matter what you have lost there simply isnt enough of them to begin tracking it down
644230 that may be one of the worst twists of fate in what happened to madeleine that tragically she went missing in the wrong place
644231 eamonn was looking forward to his holiday and cant believe this has happened to him
644232 the only reason he brought so much cash is because he didnt want to use his credit card every time the kids needed some money
644233 hes not very happy because he was staying a top quality hotel and his family could quite easily
644234 police are investigating a burglary in the villa moura area and enquiries are continuing
644235 we never expected anything like this to happen it was awful
644236 not only was our dream holiday ruined but this man made off with valuables which were of sentimental value
644237 a loving daughter sister friend and soulmate from ma da sean stephen gerald and anne marie we love you pet and will miss you
644238 jean valued her friends enormously and maintained bonds of friendship all throughout her life
644239 jean liked people she was thoughtful towards others she would do people a good turn and would help out whoever she could
644240 alongside that she was a lively young person who enjoyed the craic she was game for a laugh and would do anything for a joke and in company she was the life and soul of the party
644241 you just feel so helpless and even though youre not responsible you think theres something you could have done to stop it
644242 the vigils helped to get rid of the fear anger and frustration
644243 you feel like youre doing something to help the wee children and thats one of the reasons we started this fund
644244 we raised 750 in one night the children couldnt even get into their house to get their clothes because it was sealed off
644245 the whole street is frightened its like something you see on tv after the vigil i came home and lay on the bed and cried its heartbreaking
644246 please dont hate me dad i will return one day not just yet im in trouble money wise and i need to save up that money that i had taken from you
644247 if you have any love left for me at all can you pay off my credit card debts
644248 i know this isnt the ideal method of communication that you deserve give mum and the rest of the family my love
644249 you felt guilty when you didnt need to you thought we were all mad at you for doin what you wanted
644250 get some rest ill give my love to the skies
644251 i hope you are free from the torment you must have been feeling
644252 ill miss you man nights out will never be the same without you you were the coolest guy id met in years i still cant get my head around the fact that your not here rest in peace man well all see you again sometime
644253 friend in a million im so sorry we werent there for you we both are but im glad we got to see you that night it was such a good night we all couldnt stop laughing it was more than coincidence we were meant to ask yous down that night heres hoping you can see us now and know how much we appreciated having you while we did
644254 ive just came back from a holiday and we turned on the news and saw that another young guy was stabbed in london
644255 its disgusting and disgraceful that so many young people are being murdered whether its with knives or anything else something needs to be done about it everybody knows that something really has to be done to sort it out once and for all
644256 picture something better for your life dont settle for second best find yourself a good hobby and good friends go and make a career for yourself look at yourself as someone who is up and coming in the world who is going to have a good long successful life
644257 westlife are not a political band but if theres anything we can do to help we would
644258 we would sign our name to anything that helps sort out this mess we would help with any worthy campaign that is for a good cause and this is something we think is worthy
644259 we are simple people its going to be a simple occasion and we will have good tunes playing all the time
644260 i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to do something different
644261 louis is going to be involved in the record label and all the decision making this is my first project outside westlife
644262 its going to be more a case of finding real talent and taking them away without anybody seeing them before launching them as the next big girl band i think going down the reality tv line is probably a bit common at the minute i think to try and do what were doing on tv would just get lost and thats not necessary how we want to do it we want to find the next big irish girl band
644263 we are all just devastated at the minute and cant believe this has happened
644264 stephen was just a normal fella who enjoyed life this is a terrible tragedy we would like to thank everyone who helped search for him
644265 its still early days and we dont know what has happened yet were just shocked
644266 a mans body was found near the charles grime bridge by a man on a boat
644267 a post mortem examination will now be carried out to establish the cause of death
644268 i heard about this and i just cant believe it i know the family well and the entire village is just in absolute shock
644269 stephen went out to australia for a great experience and you never expect anything like this to happen
644270 he was a great lad and im sure the village will stand in solidarity with the family at this tragic time
644271 when i saw his picture in the paper i felt sick
644272 hes a maniac and ive said for years that people like him dont change
644273 i thought i had moved on but when something like this happens it just brings it all back
644274 he nearly killed me that time and i knew i had to get out before i ended up dead
644275 when we first got together he was so charming all my friends thought he was wonderful
644276 but he started beating me when i was pregnant and it just got worse
644277 i could tell by his eyes when he was going to start he had the most evil eyes
644278 when i had aimee he told me i wasnt allowed to go and visit my catholic friends
644279 my heart goes out to that poor girl jean god love those wee wains
644280 he left lynne for dead and he didnt even know her
644281 i said at the time when he only got five years that he should have got far longer
644282 i believe he should have got a life sentence for what he did to me and lynne
644283 there should be some mental health checks in place for people like him he should have been assessed at the end of his jail sentence instead of being let back out onto the streets
644284 ill have to tell aimee about what is happening she and her friends watch the tv they see the papers and its better coming from me than someone else
644285 i will always be fearful of him but ive tried to get on with my life both for my sake and aimees

644350 i think hes more of a fluid runner than a young jamal lewis
644351 in some ways stewart is a little more instinctive runner than jamal he will have to adjust from a spread offense to a traditional nfl offense and that might take him a few months but hes 240 hes athletic and he can catch
644352 he scares me because hes not a real tough kid
644353 hes got some run skills and size but he just kind of gives up at times for a big kid he just kind of drops
644354 surgery might drop him a little but i dont think it will drop him that much
644355 even with the injury hes still going to be ready by camp it might drop him a few spots or bump felix jones or one of these guys ahead of him but i dont think so
644356 oregon is a little bit more of a spread offense coming across the backfield out of the shotgun handing the ball off that type of thing the surgery is definitely something you investigate and look at thoroughly they say its turf toe but the rehab may be more extensive than everyone was led to believe
644357 id take him in a second at that pick but he wont be there
644358 he is athletic he can bend he can move his feet hes got real good body control and hes a giant
644359 his workout was a red flag but he benched 27 which is good and his tape is real good
644360 i just think hes a mauler and he has less than great feet
644361 that bothers you now it might not bother some other people
644362 hes a fat guy remember the fat guy from wisconsin that failed and aaron gibson was way more talented than otah whoever gets him is going to have a big heartache i dont know what everybody sees in otah

644364 jagad raya sudah berumur 12 hingga 15 milyar tahun sedangkan manusia baru muncul sekitar 40 000 tahun lalu kita adalah pendatang baru di jagad ini sebelum kita barangkali ada kehidupan lain di tempat lain yang lebih dahulu berkembang
644365 oleh sebab itu sangat sukar untuk berpikir bahwa tidak ada makhluk lain yang berevolusi di waktu dan tempat yang maha luas ini
644366 lebih dari setengah abad kemudian teleskop hubble menunjukkan di luar sana sedikitnya ada 100 milyar galaksi
644367 padahal masing masing galaksi seperti galaksi kita bima sakti adalah rumah bagi sekitar seratus milyar bintang
644368 kini kita tahu bahwa planet planet di luar sana mengelilingi sepuluh atau dua puluh persen dari bintang bintang yang kita lihat sejauh ini memang planet planet besar sajalah yang kita deteksi namun bisa jadi di antara planet planet yang lebih kecil terdapat kehidupan
644369 tumbuhnya pemikiran mengenai adanya kehidupan di luar bumi tidak terbendung lagi
644370 kita menemukan lautan dalam di bulan bulan yupiter dan beberapa dugaan bahwa di planet mars dahulu pernah ada kehidupan nah bila hal hal seperti itu ditemukan di tata surya kita sendiri apakah tidak mungkin hal yang lebih mencengangkan akan kita temui di bagian lain di jagad yang tak terkira luasnya ini
644371 alien pastilah lebih besar dari tikus karena tikus hanya memiliki otak kecil sementara bentuk kehidupan yang maju pastilah memiliki otak cukup besar

644381 beberapa orang menganggapnya diakibatkan oleh gempa bumi sebagian orang yang lain menyebutnya ufo sebagian orang yang lain lagi yakin itu tadi adalah sinar sang buddha saya katakan pada mereka untuk menyebutnya sebagai tanda yang menguntungkan
644382 jika pihak militer tidak mengejarnya itu karena mereka percaya itu bukan ufo mungkin mereka sedang menguji coba sebuah pesawat baru

644425 there is none righteous not even one there is none who understands there is none who seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become useless there is none who does good there is not even one
644426 but jesus on his part was not entrusting himself to them for he knew all men and because he did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man for he himself knew what was in man

644428 when we choose gods vision of who we are we are living as god made us to live
644429 and as we live in this life in harmony with gods intentions for us the life of heaven becomes more and more present in our lives heaven comes to earth

644432 and if your right hand makes you stumble cut it off and throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to go into hell
644433 for jesus this new kind of life in him is not about escaping this world but about making it a better place here and now the goal for jesus isnt to get into heaven the goal is to get heaven here
644434 and do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
644435 and jesus calls us to return to our true selves the pure whole people god originally intended us to be before we veered off course somewhere in you is the you whom you were made to be
644436 if someone wanted to start a mormon emergent church would that be valid

644481 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money

644483 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
644484 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
644485 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
644486 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
644487 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
644488 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
644489 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
644490 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
644491 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
644492 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
644493 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
644494 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
644495 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
644496 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
644497 oh noes the basic cost structure of society has shifted due to oil scarcity i blame the evil bastards at edf and british gas
644498 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
644499 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
644500 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
644501 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
644502 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
644503 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
644504 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
644505 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
644506 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
644507 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
644508 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
644509 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
644510 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
644511 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
644512 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
644513 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
644514 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
644515 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
644516 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
644517 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
644518 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
644519 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
644520 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
644521 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
644522 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
644523 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
644524 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
644525 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
644526 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
644527 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
644528 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
644529 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members

644534 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
644535 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
644536 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
644537 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
644538 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
644539 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
644540 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
644541 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
644542 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
644543 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
644544 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
644545 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
644546 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
644547 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
644548 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
644549 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs

644741 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
644742 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
644743 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
644744 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
644745 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
644746 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
644747 i wish i could have given it one more go
644748 i really do believe these could be the best years of my playing career and i can go on and score plenty of runs it is a difficult job but a fantastic job but not many people get to do it which is a real privilege ive loved every minute of it
644749 i think the decision came as a surprise to the players
644750 obviously i am taking a break out of the game and then will come back and play for yorkshire this was an instinctive decision that this was the time to move on
644751 i have some great memories leading out my country for the first time and of course everything that happened in 2005 in the ashes
644752 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
644753 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
644754 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
644755 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year

644767 the way burke is acting is as if the 1973 amendments never took place
644768 its a little bit ironic for a progressive conservative to be harkening back to smallwoodian legislation
644769 i came to geneva the city of the united nations and freedom 1 to ask for the law to be respected to demand the closure of the guant namo camp and secret prisons and to demand that this illegal situation be brought to an end

644772 weve had four more years of bad economic policies that have run the economy into a very bad place
644773 he made me feel better that theres the possibility that business as usual will stop
644774 the way you win florida is you do what hes doing
644775 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
644776 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
644777 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
644778 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
644779 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
644780 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
644781 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
644782 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
644783 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
644784 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
644785 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
644786 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
644787 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
644788 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
644789 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
644790 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck
644791 race plays a role in american politics in a lot of different ways its not just ku klux klan style racism
644792 when a large number of african americans decide to support barack obama on the assumption hed be a better vehicle for pursuing their interests thats taking race into consideration
644793 its simple these are three of the biggest celebrities in the world thats why they were chosen
644794 one of obamas big problems is that hes black and he does have a funny name
644795 paramount importance to study the roots of terrorism and other forms of violence
644796 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
644797 elements of national power beyond the guns and steel of the military
644798 in iraq and afghanistan the heroic efforts and best intentions of our men and women in uniform have at times been undercut by a lack of knowledge of the culture and people they are dealing with every day
644799 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
644800 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way

644809 local shepherds from the gujjar community had guided infiltrators through craggy mountain shepherd pathways the paramilitary bsf created to patrol the india pakistan border in 1965 and deployed along the loc after the simla agreement of 1972 was lackadaisical in patrolling passage across the loc was easily obtained by paying bribes set at predetermined rates
644810 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
644811 not every one that says to me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name and in your name have cast out devils and in your name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity
644812 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes
644813 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
644814 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
644815 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
644816 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
644817 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
644818 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
644819 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
644820 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
644821 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
644822 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
644823 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
644824 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
644825 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
644826 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
644827 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
644828 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
644829 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
644830 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
644831 cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
644832 doc it hurts when i lift my arm this way
644833 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
644834 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
644835 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
644836 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
644837 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
644838 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
644839 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
644840 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
644841 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
644842 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
644843 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
644844 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
644845 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
644846 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
644847 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
644848 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
644849 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
644850 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
644851 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
644852 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
644853 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
644854 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
644855 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
644856 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
644857 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
644858 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
644859 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
644860 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
644861 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
644862 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
644863 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
644864 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
644865 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
644866 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
644867 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
644868 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
644869 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
644870 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
644871 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
644872 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
644873 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
644874 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
644875 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
644876 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
644877 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
644878 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
644879 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
644880 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
644881 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
644882 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
644883 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

644898 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
644899 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
644900 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

645017 ive thought about this a lot being almost 60 its impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things but the question of did we do something that was horrendous awful i dont think so i think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable

645021 he played a quiet game but he was not afraid of taking chances he wasnt afraid of running a bluff sometimes the stakes were pretty big but nick had daring and a flair and knew what to do
645022 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
645023 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
645024 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
645025 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
645026 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
645027 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
645028 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
645029 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
645030 the point is really to provide educational opportunities and a social and fun atmosphere for people who really love and respect irish traditional music and dance
645031 i look forward to it every year its always amazing you actually go into a depression the week after
645032 seeing these great musicians and having the opportunity to meet and have sessions with musicians youve heard about all your life but never met before its just phenomenal
645033 youll be the most improved player in the class by the end of the week then
645034 i enjoy teaching just to help people through their difficulties just to give somebody a little bit of confidence
645035 even if its just enough to get them into their local area to play sessions
645036 for me as a musician i get to play with people i admire with people you dont get to play with on a regular basis
645037 and the fact that you can walk down the street and see some of irelands national treasures its a weird sort of feeling
645038 you dont expect these people to be walking up route 145 i grew up listening to de danaan for years and to have alec finn and johnny mcdonagh sitting here it means a lot theres just no down side to it
645039 i also go to a music camp in ohio once a year
645040 people dont get it until theyre there they think im going to a party camp or a rock camp where i pretend to be a musician for a day but this is bone deep you get the true feeling you get to work and really focus
645041 they dont realize how cosmic the music really is its roots music which feeds everything else

645043 nevadas council to establish academic standards was scheduled to meet july 21 to adopt new public school history standards when some attention was drawn to what theyre up to they promptly postponed their meeting for lack of a quorum
645044 behind all the double talk about replacing fact driven chronological history with a more thematic approach the unmistakable goal is to dumb down our history classes still further
645045 kind sir i can assure you that no job or law school application has asked any questions about the names and places of american battles of any century more importantly such a view obstructs a constructive conversation about how best to teach history to kids
645046 i taught american history at unlv for three semesters and i really really did not want my students simply to spew facts at me
645047 studying history is a means to an end it can provide an opportunity for kids to master a much needed set of skills
645048 isnt that really what most folks would like our educational system to accomplish
645049 obstructs a constructive conversation about how best to teach history to kids

645053 its the light bill the water bill the gas bill everything went up
645054 seniors are cutting back on their medication theyre cutting back on the food they need
645055 and they dont want to let their children know it
645056 because they dont want to be a burden we know senior citizens who are not using their air conditioning this could be very dangerous if they get too hot and arent drinking enough water
645057 because of gas prices many are not going to church or their senior citizens groups the way they used to
645058 i pray to the good lord that it gets better
645059 i catch the devil with the bills my water bill is 100 i dont even have a washing machine or dishwasher
645060 you have to pay somebody to drive you somewhere and with the price of gas i have to pay more
645061 my light bill has been around 240 245 a month
645062 when youre a senior citizen there are things you have to do without

645067 we also offer financial assistance but were booked through aug 19 to see people not all of those folks are seniors but seniors are coming in as well
645068 the economy is affecting our ability to provide services for them
645069 were anticipating that at the beginning of the new fiscal year oct 1 that because of the price of gas services provided to homes such as meal deliveries will have to be cut
645070 rising costs will be a determining factor in how many people may be helped
645071 but that income is diminishing rapidly every time the market goes down
645072 our survey showed that 23 percent said they had made early withdrawals from retirement accounts
645073 about 44 percent of those used this money to pay off debt a third to pay off living expenses
645074 that money is going to be needed later in life and to pull it out now could be disastrous
645075 this is a great time to re evaluate all your investment holdings we are in the middle of a very bad credit crisis and many of the risks that come with investments are now being realized
645076 look for signs of depression look in the refrigerator the medicine cabinet to see if there have been any changes

645091 we dont really know yet what it means to be green in the hospitality field
645092 said they would suffer discomfort because they would get back to their room and it would be extremely hot
645093 indicated that entering a dark room could be a safety issue
645094 why run the risk of losing a customer because a room needs a few minutes to cool while the air conditioning kicks in its better business just to run the a c and make sure the client comes back

645135 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief

645137 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
645138 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
645139 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
645140 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
645141 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
645142 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
645143 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city

645156 what we know after centuries of catching measles is that most healthy children do not die of measles provided we have sophisticated hospital care available for the ones that get really ill and even then about 1 in every 2000 kids who get measles will be permanently brain damaged or will die i suspect most of the authors here over 40 have all had measles i know i certainly have and i dont seem to be impaired in any way even at this late hour of course because the numbers that suffer permanent damage are small with modern advanced care we are likely not to have personally known anyone who was seriously ill with measles this tends to make us believe erroneously that measles is just uncomfortable and no more

645160 it took him no time at all to comprehend and respect that i had no plans to promote anything and was devoted to scientifically testing these treatments
645161 he began to hear from numerous sources that i was not sufficiently supportive of the field but he kept encouraging me to do the rigorous science
645162 there is a mountain of evidence to suggest that homoeopathic remedies simply do not work
645163 typically do not contain a single molecule of any active ingredients
645164 speak for complementary medicine to government the public and within the university
645165 the effects of homeopathic potentised remedies are highly implausible only if you limit your scientific approach to that of chemistry and if you rigorously use an inappropriate test if a wider range of scientific investigatory techniques are used and if appropriate tests are used then the results have the chance of according with the clinical evidence 200 years of clinical evidence
645166 diluted with shaking which shaking is believed by homeopaths to impart magical healing properties
645167 the effects of potentised remedies are highly implausible only if you limit your scientific approach to that of the same established tests proven over decades of experience to be the best way to test medical treatments including techniques that are inadequately controlled and or spurious that do not rigorously exclude experimenter observer and reporter biases then the results have the chance of oming out apparently positive according with
645168 promote homeopathy and to defend the right of people in the uk to choose homeopathy as a therapy within the national health service
645169 dont like the physical laws of this universe insist on being judged by the laws of a parallel one you thought up specially investigation
645170 indeed a professor should be an expert in his field and ernst proclaims to have studied a number of cam therapies yet our research reflects that this might not be so therefore to have knowledge of his studies would put our minds at rest
645171 i have been a qualified and registered homeopath with the society of homeopaths for the last 15 years and i am very keen to attend insightful teaching seminars or lectures given or inspired by professor ernst
645172 so ernst is a man of integrity as was sir maurice laing
645173 all ernsts actions are merely the attempt to legitimize the homeopathy
645174 then you start working in a homeopathic hospital and people get better
645175 ernsts first post after qualifying as a doctor was in a homeopathic hospital in munich where he was greatly impressed
645176 if you study medicine and pharmacology you know homeopathy cant work
645177 then you start working in a homeopathic hospital and people get better is that a miracle it certainly is very impressive for a young doctor
645178 looking back i wonder if a lot was a placebo effect
645179 i would like to have an institute of placebo research but the funding would be even worse you would get placebo money but its absolutely fascinating whats happening there it is what gels mainstream and complementary medicine together as doctors we dont want to realise it we pride ourselves that therapy does the trick
645180 what have i missed here aside from the audible grinding of axes
645181 homeopathy is lucrative and so long as it continues to be so will surely survive as surely as astrology palmistry and other methods of getting a living out of the weakness and credulity of mankind and womankind
645182 i strongly suspect the reason david colquhoun doesnt write a book about homeopathy is that he has better things to do
645183 why the thes printed this snide personal attack at all escapes me
645184 then you start working in a homeopathic hospital and people get better
645185 blithe statement of utter bullshit plus later small print hedging and disclaimers
645186 but again i never make any promises because every human body is different and responds differently to manual therapy treatments
645187 the above advice is not a substitute for seeing your gp
645188 the law is like thill which way well turn it to thereto well come
645189 not recognising something that should mean they send the person to a conventional doctor
645190 if i am totally honest i dont really know why osteopathy helps asthma but i have seen children able to stop their medication following treatment

645192 i mean nobody says i am so excited about the batesville 22 casket because its made of their favorite wood
645193 in the beginning one of the major players patted us on the head and said good luck but our caskets and urns are the only ones used in the industry
645194 we had no idea what we were doing with these long pieces of cloth and it was really undignified trying to lower the shrouds into the ground
645195 this is the last industry to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century
645196 myself and others like me are completely reinventing the business
645197 you wont see most families shooting cremains in the air
645198 no matter how hard a funeral director might put his foot down and think that a star trek casket or whatever is tacky the fact is the public likes it

645215 the kde project looked to apple as an example of the importance of an attractive ui
645216 if you like the way the old one looked then use the old one
645217 i think the problem with kde 4 in general is that its developers decided to make a playground for themselves

645221 scientists want to harvest stem cells from these hybrid embryos to treat diseases such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers
645222 scientists want to harvest stem cells from these hybrid embryos to work out better ways to treat diseases such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers
645223 scientists want to harvest stem cells from these hybrid embryos to work out better ways to treat diseases such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers the hybrid cells will allow the methods to be worked out in animal experiments but without having to use real human embryos to provide the stem cells that way we will see sooner if stem cell therapy is practical and under what circumstances without needing to destroy lots of human embryos
645224 tampering with the very nature of what makes us human
645225 is it not worth underlining that hybrid embryos will be subject to the same regulatory procedure that applies to embryos at present namely the requirement for destruction at 14 days or upon the emergence of the primitive streak therefore the idea conjured up by some of the more lurid speculation in the tabloids that there will be some persistent ongoing consequence is nonsense
645226 the decision to allow creation of a hybrid embryo represents a disastrous setback for human dignity in britain it is creating a category of beings regarded as sub human who can be used as raw material to benefit other members of the human family effectively creating a new class of slaves
645227 the bill permits the creation of embryos containing human and animal material for studying diseases like parkinsons and alzheimers the legislation would allow scientists to grow the embryos for up to 14 days
645228 turn them into a hybrid being with mutant dna and animal powers
645229 the reason why the select committee advocated including true hybrid embryos in the legislative regime controlled by the hfea that could license their use if an appropriate application came forward was that there was no good reason not to once one accepts that it is legitimate to do destructive medical research on human embryos there is no ethical reason to give greater protection to things that are not human embryos it would be an inversion of everyones ethical compass to say that certain embryo entities require greater protection than a fully human embryo
645230 the decision to allow creation of a hybrid embryo represents a disastrous setback for human dignity in britain
645231 the claim that hybrid embryos are going to be used for treatment and the ideas that these embryos will be grown into scary human animal sub humans or that saviour siblings will be kept in big warehouses and harvested for their organs seem to be the most widespread

645240 how can they just mix all those different trials in together and get a sensible answer people are individuals i dont know anyone else who eats the sort of diet i do so how can these scientists possibly say the supplements arent going to help me and of course these so called scientists have to say that so that the drug companies can make money dont they they dont want people getting healthy on their own without their pills personally ive never taken so much as an aspirin
645241 being awake at odd hours as i am simply plays havoc with your normal eating habits
645242 you cant always just grab a quick snack on the run especially if its hard to catch i try to eat regularly and not snack in between but sometimes i do get the most when he does succumb to the need for a snack dracula know what he likes as a quick bite
645243 but i cant eat it too often i worry about all the
645244 the ways in which studies like this can be biased
645245 the ways in which statistics and statistical testing work in relation to this kind of experiment
645246 i can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing i have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things it doesnt frighten me
645247 personally i think there is a lot of danger in folk who cannot see that there are people who know more than them or even concede that such people probably exist when looking at this and other issues to do with interpreting research to repeat it again you have to be aware of how much you know and how much you dont if that doesnt sound too donald rumsfeld
645248 the worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve the ones you can really contribute something to no problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it
645249 you the patient consumer can have no relevant input into the discussion
645250 you the patient consumer need to have an awareness of where your knowledge or understanding is insufficient to make an informed choice or to tell which factors should weight the decision most and know who to ask for help
645251 we are all individual consumers of services for everything with choice in all things
645252 who are the people most likely to know all the studies all the background all the factors influencing the trustworthiness or otherwise of individual studies and all the hidden catches in comparing different patient groups and studies well for me its no contest the answer is that i would put professors of obstetrics amp gynaecology o amp g or experienced hospital o amp g consultants at the top of the expert scale for this particular issue and joe and joanna public at the bottom

645381 on one hand australia is an oasis of game development with a thriving highly skilled industry generating hundreds of millions of dollars of valuable export revenue
645382 on the other hand australias lack of an r18 classification means that some of the worlds most important video games are effectively banned from appearing down under at all
645383 i started the ico project ueda san joined my team in japan as a cinematic animator but he created a short movie and presented it to me and said i want to make this game
645384 i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game
645385 it took four years and the second game took four years too so i started calling them the olympic team they havent released a ps3 title yet of course not theyll take four years but they have something really really good on the way
645386 the british government has learned that saddam husein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
645387 dalam tempo 45 jam setelah perintah saddam hussein dikeluarkan iraq akan mampu melancarkan serangan dengan senjata senjata nuklir kuman dan biologis
645388 weve found the weapons of mass destruction you know we found biological laboratories and well find more weapons as time goes on but for those who say we havent found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons theyre wrong we found them
645389 para analis yang meneliti kasus peristiwa serangan dan hancurnya gedung kembar wtc itu mencurigai pesawat pesawat nahas itu kemungkinan dikemudikan dengan alat

645391 sementara konflik di iraq yang tak terselesaikan memberikan pembenaran kebutuhan akan kehadiran dengan kekuatan yang memadai dari pasukan amerika di kawasan teluk melahirkan persoalan tentang rejim saddam hussein
645392 mencegah negara negara industri maju sampai menantang kepemimpinan kita atau bahkan mencita citakan untuk menjalankan peran regional atau global yang lebih besar
645393 iran akan menjadi ancaman besar terhadap kepentingan amerika serikat seperti yang pernah dilakukan oleh iraq
645394 yang dapat menyerang sasaran jenis gen tertentu dan barangkali dapat mengubah peperangan kuman dari senjata teror menjadi alat politik yang bermanfaat
645395 informasi yang disampaikan oleh badan badan intelijen eropa sebelum tanggal 11 september 2001 demikian luasnya sehingga sebenarnya tidak mungkin fbi atau pun cia berlindung di belakang dalih bahwa hal itu sampai bisa terjadi karena ketidak mampuan mereka
645396 tindakan sembrono dapat menimbulkan resiko buyarnya usaha internasional sekiranya osamah bin ladin sampai tertangkap
645397 sejujurnya saja kita tidak akan mungkin memperoleh persetujuan rakyat secara mendadak untuk melancarkan kampanye militer di afghanistan terkecuali dengan mengkaitkan alasannya dengan apa yang terjadi pada tanggal 11 september 2001

645401 dari awal kita meyakini saddam hussein itu orangnya jahat karenanya ia harus dienyahkan
645402 bagi saya berdasarkan pemahaman tentang tindakan pre emptif amerika serikat memiliki hak unilateral untuk memutuskan apa saja yang dianggap perlu hal itu merupakan lompatan besar
645403 presiden telah berusaha mencari segala jalan yang mungkin untuk memecahkan situsi di iraq secara damai
645404 seperti halnya pemerintahan sebelum saya kami memang bertekad untuk menggulingkan rejim saddam hussein kami hanya menyempurnakan kebijakan sebelumnya dan kemudian peristiwa 11 september terjadi dan sebagai presiden amerika serikat kewajiban saya yang paling mulia adalah bagaimana melindungi keamanan bagi rakyat amerika saya memikul tugas itu dengan sangat sungguh sungguh dan kami bukan hanya berurusan dengan taliban kami bekerja sama dengan perserikatan bangsa bangsa dan masyarakat internasional dan membuat jelas saddam hussein harus dilucuti

645407 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
645408 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
645409 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
645410 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
645411 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
645412 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
645413 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
645414 demand for renewable energy projects enhances the feasibility of a wood fired plant
645415 expectations are high hopefully well pick up where we left off
645416 as it is though that was last year weve got to continue the success
645417 when i feel they are mature enough ill let them play
645418 you wouldnt have a hope of getting right for a match if you didnt have the co operation of the lads
645419 devil may care lazy haydog who likes to occasionally dodge training
645420 i took a look at what was being written in the newspapers and just decided it was best to leave them down
645421 i played on cussen for half and hour and did my best against a lad who is 6 7 i tried to break as many balls as i could thats all you can do if we meet again ill have to find a way to make myself taller
645422 its a position no one seems to want and people have seen it as almost a curse since seamus moynihan went there too but its a very hard position make one mistake and youve had a bad game
645423 look theres no doubt the season has been up and down
645424 in many ways its been frustrating were training seven months and lost the one big championship match that came our way we beat clare and lost to cork but now we have a chance to go out and put it right we have enough training done jesus were training since january its time to get out on the field again
645425 in hindsight it wouldve been better to have gone into the interval only two points up that would have been more realistic too remember all the bad wides that cork shot in the first half they should have converted at least four of them that would have made us sit up and think instead we sat back they brought in the big man changed their game and won the breaking ball around the middle of the field whatever ball we sent into our forwards wasnt that good either afterwards we knew we had a lot of work to do
645426 all ill say is that training has definitely gone up a notch since the cork game
645427 yeah there were a few home truths told in the days afterwards and you could see the intensity rise back on the training field there were a couple of exchanges here and there and a few hard knocks too but thats no harm at all sure were in knock out territory now id be worried if the stakes didnt rise
645428 theyre a tough team and very nearly put us away last year but people were saying we hadnt a game in six or seven weeks and were a bit cold well see today how that theory stands up
645429 its definitely one of the tougher draws but id be happy enough with it i mean if we want to win another all ireland we have to beat the best teams there we may as well start with monaghan if we dont beat them we wont have been good enough i appreciate these matches if we are to win sam why not start today its kill or be killed time
645430 theres no point in holding the ball up out the field it needs to be hit into the lads quickly
645431 in the drawn barry owens on it gave them a target man and they could have won that day football always changes some teams play two men inside others have three some have the blanket defence and some the blanket midfield nearly every team is going for the tall man inside now but if someone wins an all ireland with a new tactic well all have it next year well be looking for long ball and quick ball we dont hide that
645432 we kept away from it and blocked it out let the appeal process take its toll and at the end of the day the show had to go on
645433 were glad its sorted now but the truth is we have an awful lot of work to do to get to a stage where paul comes back into the frame we certainly wont be looking past monaghan if we did wed be foolish its the same with this three in a row thing that hasnt even been mentioned in the dressing room this year maybe if we reached an all ireland final it would be the motivation to get past the finishing line but there is some amount of work to do to even get that far
645434 no its not that hard to keep the fire burning
645435 the change of management helped if i was a manager id only stay in a place two or three years after that you become stale and so does the team
645436 ah im looking forward to it now i love the big games we might as well go out and see what were made of monaghan are on a roll some lads might be a bit fearful but i see it as a great challenge

645454 no se pueden comparar porque el baloncesto ha cambiado mucho es que han pasado 24 a os pero creo que si sta en pek n gana una medalla ser indiscutiblemente la mejor porque tendr un ciclo de tres medallas seguidas junto al oro de jap n y la plata de madrid aunque para m al margen de lo que haga en los juegos ya es la mejor selecci n de la historia
645455 por calidad talento est claro que este equipo puede ganar a cualquier rival sobre todo si exhibe una virtud muy importante para triunfar en un gran campeonato la mentalidad de equipo el trabajo y el esp ritu colectivos
645456 pueden durar m s pero me los acabar n batiendo por ejemplo el de partidos con la selecci n lo puede batir m s o menos inmediatamente carlos jim nez que ha cumplido 163 en la gira preparatoria y en un futuro creo que ricky puede superarme en palmar s ol mpico si con 17 a os ya va a unos juegos a los 28 ya me puede haber igualado

645523 thomas jones will be 30 in august hes not over the hill not with the way he takes care of his body hes a good football player if you go back and look at the trade the jets made to acquire jones from the bears they look like geniuses that was a no brainer there was a lot of talk about the jets taking darren mcfadden in the draft but after the raiders took him they didnt even come back around and take a running back what does that tell you they are happy with what they have with the way they invested in their offensive line thomas jones could have a breakout year
645524 the misinformation out there about the rookie salary cap is out of control you hear all about how much the rookies make but outside of the top four or five rookie contracts most rookie deals are cap friendly thats why no one wants a top five pick anymore but the owners do not want the rookie structure to go away no one talks about devin hester and marques colston and all the rookies that have outplayed their contracts that are stuck making the minimum anyone who looks at the numbers will see it clearly just look at where the money goes only 3 7 percent of the salary cap is going to rookies the owners problem is a distribution issue its not a rookie issue
645525 the bucs have changed their philosophy they have gone from one of the oldest teams in the league to one of the youngest they are going to have 70 million to spend next year a lot of that has to do with the way bucs gm bruce allen handles the cap he knows how to play the game
645526 every pre draft meeting in green bay for the last five years has started with one question is brett favre coming back its ridiculous that its still an issue favre has been toying with the organization how do you plan to move forward when your quarterback situation is up in the air thats why aaron rodgers was drafted if it were my decision i would trade favre i would get what i can for him then its over its definitive i would want it known that the packers have officially moved on
645527 aaron rodgers had a lot of audacity to tell fans get on board or shut the hell up he has not won a game in the nfl you want to talk about an ironic situation to be in mike mccarthy was the lead proponent of drafting alex smith over aaron rodgers when he was in san francisco as the offensive coordinator now hes in green bay going into the season with rodgers being the guy mccarthy did not like rodgers personality at all did not think he was a leader he thought he was too into himself i think thats why favre never warmed up to him and has never liked him because of those qualities
645528 youd be surprised how many coaches hate their own personnel guys they want to tell their guys to shove it so they look good so they will call around talk to their buddies around the league they cant communicate with their own people you wouldnt believe how many calls i get from coaches and scouts wanting to know what i think thats the way the league works and the beauty of it is do you think im going to be honest all the time
645529 when you look at coaches on the rise you still have to think the young kid josh mcdaniel in new england is going to get a lot of interest your roots mean a lot in this league and for as much as the patriots may have come under attack last season there has been no one better than bill belichick when it comes to training and developing coaches
645530 marshawn lynch is a study in contradictions he has a great sense of humor and he can be very kind and considerate but he is a byproduct of his upbringing and oakland is tough tough
645531 i think mike ditka might have been right when he traded his draft for ricky williams they were turning it around he was a helluva football player i think people are going to be pleasantly surprised with him this year if he is half as good as he was when he was at his best hell still be better than a lot of starters i think hed start for us with the way ive heard hes looked
645532 the 49ers have the talent defensively to be competitive but their offense needs to step up the offensive line has a lot of question marks right now and i see a very average group of receivers especially from a playmaking standpoint frank gore can rush for 130 yards on 25 carries but hes not special and hes injury prone there are too many questions on offense
645533 everyone who has helped build the media machine against bill belichick being a cheater all the guys slinging the arrows in his back are the very same guys who are out tampering in free agency and talking to other teams about contracts and they are all doing it its collusion its a big problem in the league the commissioner sits up in his ivory tower trying to pretend all 32 teams are operating on an equal playing field the reality is teams have been ignoring rules for so long that the rulebook does not mean a whole lot not in a competitive league like we are in i wish it were not that way because we try to operate within the rules but its not easy to survive when the rest of the league is operating one way and you are playing by the rules thats the predicament everyone is in
645534 there has been very little movement in front offices and even when there is everyone has their own short lists i wouldnt hire anyone i havent worked with or dont know thats just me what surprised me is that the saints who are known for being notoriously cheap actually fired some guys still under contract the owner there rarely has done that i think they are starting to listen to the head coach more as they should the coaches were the ones responsible for overhauling that roster sean payton is in line for a big contract especially if they get it going again this year after solidifying the middle of their defense through the draft that was a big problem for them last year
645535 i cannot believe the nfl will not try to step in on behalf of the best ownership group in the league at some point and keep the rooney family in control

645543 i am glad its sorted and that is the most important thing i can say now that i am an official player of bolton
645544 i am now in bolton where i hope to give all i can so we can have a good season
645545 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
645546 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
645547 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
645548 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club

645552 mick mccarthy is a man of his word and i always knew i was going to sign it was making sure things were right for myself
645553 were absolutely delighted that hes come back into the team and scored a goal
645554 hes going to be a real plus for us this season and weve got big hopes that hes going to come back and be bigger faster and stronger

645564 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
645565 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
645566 if we play a 4 4 2 formation then gerrard can play as a midfielder if we play with torres on his own up front then gerrard and keane can play either side of him
645567 if he needs to adapt then he will adapt because he is a player of quality who can play in different positions

645571 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognized clinical nomenclature is not being used
645572 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
645573 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
645574 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm

645586 jim recalls barging into dads study unannounced finding him on his knees praying and quietly backing out
645587 dads mind was so full of scripture he spent quite a lot of time memorizing his bible in both english and french that not infrequently he addressed us in biblical quotations even when they were strictly speaking out of context the text itself had become the stuff of his verbal apparatus with the result that this was the language he naturally deployed when he had something to say

645595 i disappointed my parents they wanted i guess the best for me they wanted me to use my intelligence and find a way to support myself they hated my interest in thunder they said cut it out they thought that my love of thunder was a distraction from the important things they wanted me to be doing id record it and listen to it and id say listen to this and i remember my mother saying
645596 if you say one more thing about thunder you will be severely punished id have to wait until my mom and dad left the house to get back to my thunder
645597 theyd swat my interest in thunder away like it was a fly
645598 if i saw them they would only say you still havent given up thunder and that would be a great big downer

645612 the tape showed how the girl was brought into an empty room by a man with a hood over his head she was handcuffed the man cut the clothes from her body with a knife she had scratches and bruises all over her body he hit her in the face with his hand after that she was thrown to the ground by the same man and anally raped when he was done with this he threw the girl against a wall and began to beat and kick her over her whole body when she slid to the ground he went to stand with one foot on all her limbs and broke with both hands her arms and legs then for some time he slowly worked on her with a knife and stabbed her 32 times in total mainly in the chest and abdomen finally he cut her throat again slowly after that he slowly labored on the girls body from the feet to her head with great attention to the bloody details it was perfectly clear that the girl was already dead by then the whole movie had lasted 57 minutes and had not been edited
645613 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
645614 regulations are regulations the key will be whether they actually approve any protests and which ones
645615 over the past 18 years tens of thousands of people must have applied but at most a handful won approval

645622 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
645623 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
645624 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
645625 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
645626 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
645627 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
645628 paul collingwood has informed the selectors today that he will be standing down as englands one day captain
645629 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team across all forms of the game
645630 he will continue to make himself available for all forms of cricket and we expect him to play a significant role with the england side
645631 we are extremely grateful for the way in which paul has led the england one day side since his appointment last year
645632 after much careful consideration i have decided to step down as england test captain effective immediately
645633 i have made this decision with an enormous amount of pride and without any external pressure
645634 this decision has been something that has crossed my mind for some time i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
645635 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
645636 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be
645637 ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team
645638 id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain
645639 a captain is only as good as his teams and ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes
645640 on behalf of the ecb and everyone involved in cricket id like to thank michael vaughan for his contribution to the game
645641 as englands most successful captain he has always led from the front and always led with an unprecedented level of professionalism integrity and honesty every step of the way
645642 as a batsmen he has been one of the finest cricketers this country has seen and he took the england captaincy to new heights since assuming the role in 2003
645643 michael has been the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the type of character he has instilled in the england dressing room over the past six years
645644 as a leader he has proved to be a team player in every sense of the word with a ruthless edge that has led to englands resurgence as a cricketing force in recent years
645645 inter marriages have been happening so please continue with that when you get a good girl here young man marry her and then come back home
645646 your faces are bright you are earning your keep here you are all ambassadors for ghana keep it up
645647 all i know was that we were reversing the truck along the bridge when we heard a loud bang next thing i know we were in the river when i do look i saw that the bridge had collapsed i only had time to try and save myself i couldnt really see about helping my co workers i guess everyone was trying to help themselves i am just glad that i came out alive i feel sorry for the guy who died i dont really know him it was the first time i was seeing him on the project
645648 it would be premature to blame anyone for this tragedy but i was told that the ministry of works contracted jagmohans sawmill i dont know why they would have contracted a sawmill to carry out works on the site but i am sure that the ministry would have known what they were doing i hope that under this tragic circumstances that we can learn from it
645649 it is this wish i leave with the prime minister and the government of trinidad and tobago that i hope that you quickly come to grips with helping the youth remove the psychological impediments that are blocking their paths
645650 i still believe the unkind past has affected all of us on the continent of africa and the caribbean in terms of psychological and mental enslavement we must know how to push that off our backs we must take up the challenges using education
645651 i told the pm and president maxwell richards that i was falling in love with the country
645652 what i have seen is second to none in originality i was wondering if the original idea was from here the dances have kept its purity
645653 the honourable chief justice has not been holding any secret talks with the honourable attorney general nor has he had several meetings with any small table committee on possible constitutional reform for the country as reported in last fridays edition august 1 2008 of newsday
645654 upon the invitation of the executive as part of a process of consultation it had embarked upon regarding constitutional reform the honourable chief justice and a small committee of judges nominated by him held a singular meeting recently with the honourable attorney general and two members of a sub committee appointed by the government the meeting was quite preliminary and explored possible ways forward for this consultative process
645655 there was absolutely no discussion on any substantive proposals for constitutional reform
645656 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
645657 it was noted however that with those designs we would have a hospital that really could not deliver at the 2010 level therefore a team of clinicians and related personnel in tobago would have looked at those designs and they would have recommended what we would like to have
645658 so those things went to the consultants and based on that the consultants would have done a redesign they brought back those designs to our people and then discussed with them as to whether those designs did in fact reflect the request made by the clinical team
645659 basically what we are saying is that mr williams and the secretary of infrastructure public utilities whitney alfred will be having discussions and would be able to place a team on the site observing and so on
645660 but the point about it is that we will be on spot looking at the situation and being in a position to make our concerns known to the people who can in fact make a difference because even though it is a design construct contract you have to be monitoring the situation to make sure that the standards are kept and the design is adhered to
645661 the results of the study is problematic its not true that it reduces the probability of becoming infected with hiv circumcision will only reduce the risk of passing the virus from a woman to a man but not from a man to a woman it protects the inserting partner but not the receiving partner
645662 the study shows a reduction in the risk of transmission of the disease in circumcised men by 50 percent
645663 this is something we need to take note of but it does not mean that circumcised men are 100 percent protected from hiv aids so men whether circumcised or uncircumcised should continue condom use
645664 the nsp is still in the development process so we will be considering all of the available evidence in support of prevention and treatment there is a chance that circumcision is something that might be considered but cabinet has the final decision on which policies are implemented
645665 reducing the incidence of hiv infections in trinidad and tobago
645666 mitigating the negative impact of hiv aids on persons infected and affected in trinidad and tobago
645667 there is an emerging body of important information but our country is not at the stage where it can be implemented into policy of prevention
645668 for instance unaids has not yet made specifications for a generalised programme so while this information is useful to help individual adult males a decision that would impact males on a national level would be premature there is certainly a need for more analysis
645669 there is always a danger with this kind of news that people will become complacent
645670 circumcision does not mean that you are immune to aids people still need to be cautious and practice safe sex
645671 we have been teaching people about how circumcision reduces the risk of infection with men who are not circumcised the foreskin folds over the head of the penis smegma is a secretion by the glans of the foreskin smegma can build up underneath the foreskin and bacteria can accumulate and transfer between partners so there is an increased risk of infection for stds or hiv aids circumcision would protect both partners from chances of contracting diseases
645672 its not just a jewish or islamic practice but its a matter of hygiene and health
645673 most men are not willing to get circumcised because they are afraid that it will permanently damage their penis and affect their sexual functioning
645674 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
645675 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
645676 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
645677 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
645678 sesungguhnya jika manusia dan jin berkumpul untuk membuat yang serupa al quran ini niscaya mereka tidak akan dapat membuat yang serupa dengan dia sekalipun sebagian mereka menjadi pembantu bagi sebagian yang lain
645679 ini tidak lain hanyalah sihir yang dipelajari 25 ini tidak lain hanyalah perkataan manusia
645680 apakah yang dikehendaki allah dengan bilangan ini sebagai suatu perumpamaan
645681 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
645682 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
645683 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american humans
645684 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
645685 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
645686 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
645687 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
645688 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
645689 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
645690 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
645691 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
645692 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
645693 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
645694 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
645695 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
645696 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
645697 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
645698 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
645699 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
645700 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
645701 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
645702 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
645703 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
645704 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
645705 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
645706 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
645707 does frankf38 know anything at all about cars or energy
645708 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
645709 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
645710 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
645711 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
645712 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
645713 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
645714 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
645715 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
645716 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
645717 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
645718 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
645719 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
645720 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
645721 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
645722 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
645723 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
645724 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
645725 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
645726 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
645727 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
645728 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
645729 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
645730 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
645731 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
645732 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
645733 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
645734 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
645735 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
645736 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
645737 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
645738 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
645739 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
645740 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
645741 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance

645749 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
645750 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
645751 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
645752 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
645753 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
645754 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
645755 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
645756 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
645757 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
645758 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
645759 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
645760 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
645761 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
645762 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
645763 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
645764 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
645765 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
645766 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
645767 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
645768 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
645769 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
645770 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
645771 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
645772 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
645773 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
645774 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
645775 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
645776 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
645777 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
645778 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
645779 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
645780 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
645781 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
645782 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
645783 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
645784 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
645785 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
645786 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
645787 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
645788 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
645789 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
645790 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
645791 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
645792 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
645793 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
645794 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
645795 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
645796 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
645797 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
645798 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
645799 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
645800 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
645801 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
645802 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
645803 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
645804 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
645805 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
645806 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
645807 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
645808 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
645809 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
645810 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
645811 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
645812 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
645813 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
645814 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
645815 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
645816 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
645817 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
645818 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
645819 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
645820 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
645821 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
645822 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
645823 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
645824 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
645825 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
645826 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
645827 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
645828 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
645829 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
645830 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
645831 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
645832 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
645833 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
645834 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
645835 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
645836 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
645837 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
645838 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
645839 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
645840 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
645841 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
645842 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
645843 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
645844 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
645845 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
645846 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
645847 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
645848 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
645849 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
645850 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
645851 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
645852 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
645853 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
645854 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
645855 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
645856 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
645857 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
645858 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
645859 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
645860 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
645861 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
645862 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
645863 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
645864 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
645865 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
645866 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
645867 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
645868 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
645869 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
645870 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
645871 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
645872 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
645873 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
645874 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
645875 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
645876 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
645877 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
645878 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
645879 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
645880 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
645881 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
645882 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
645883 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
645884 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
645885 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
645886 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
645887 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
645888 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
645889 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
645890 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
645891 if the vice president says its do able i believe
645892 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
645893 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
645894 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
645895 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
645896 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
645897 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
645898 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
645899 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
645900 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
645901 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
645902 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
645903 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
645904 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
645905 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
645906 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
645907 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
645908 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
645909 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
645910 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
645911 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
645912 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
645913 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
645914 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
645915 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
645916 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
645917 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
645918 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
645919 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
645920 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
645921 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
645922 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
645923 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
645924 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
645925 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
645926 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
645927 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
645928 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
645929 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
645930 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
645931 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
645932 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
645933 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
645934 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
645935 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
645936 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
645937 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
645938 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
645939 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
645940 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
645941 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
645942 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
645943 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
645944 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
645945 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
645946 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
645947 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
645948 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
645949 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
645950 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
645951 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
645952 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
645953 wir wollen noch weitere ermittlungen um den balco skandal abwarten um m glichst umfassend die korrekturen abschlie en zu k nnen
645954 ich wei dass diese medaille nicht unter fairen umst nden gewonnen wurde und schmutzig ist so schwierig es ist aber ich werde sie dem internationalen olympischen komitee zur ckgeben weil ich sie nicht will ich f hle mich belogen betrogen und im stich gelassen
645955 una alteraci n dec a entonces este psiquiatra que surge casi exclusivamente durante las disputas por la custodia de un hijo
645956 es una campa a de denigraci n contra un progenitor por parte de los hijos campa a que no tiene justificaci n
645957 la combinaci n de una programaci n lavado de cerebro de un progenitor y en la que el ni o contribuye con sus propias aportaciones dirigidas al progenitor objetivo de la alienaci n
645958 destructivo para los ni os y las familias pudiendo ser irreversible en sus efectos
645959 el s ndrome es una realidad le pese a quien le pese
645960 un trastorno que se produce cuando un padre transforma la conciencia de sus hijos mediante distintas estrategias con objeto de impedir obstaculizar o destruir sus v nculos con el otro progenitor
645961 de ah la necesidad de su inclusi n como delito en el c digo penal
645962 de ah comenta que los padres sigamos siendo los m s afectados por una situaci n en la que las v ctimas principales son los hijos
645963 han reconocido su existencia no es una patolog a tiene m s de maldad que de enfermedad
645964 las campa as desatadas por determinados sectores de la sociedad entre los que cabe destacar a los propios agresores de mujeres organizados que no dudan en utilizar el inexistente sap para encubrir la violencia de todo orden que ejercen con impunidad contra los hijos e hijas comunes y las mujeres
645965 no es sino la descripci n sesgada y tendenciosa de un fen meno real que se da en el mbito legal interpretada bajo los par metros de una ideolog a patriarcal
645966 la ideolog a que sustenta el sap argumentan es abiertamente pro ped fila y sexista
645967 y el temor a la p rdida de subvenciones y prebendas
645968 el sap no es una lucha de hombres y mujeres existen unas v ctimas claras los ni os que son los que nos deben interesar y preocupar tienen derecho a tener padre y madre no o padre o madre el s ndrome puede ser el origen adem s de posteriores patolog as m s graves que condicionar n la vida emocional sentimental y familiar del adulto que fue manipulado de ni o
645969 la controversia dice viene alimentada m s por intereses de grupos y asociaciones de padres y madres separados que por criterios cient ficos la pol mica est m s llena de descalificaciones que de argumentos cient ficos
645970 para predisponerles en contra de su otro progenitor y en ltima instancia para que se nieguen a verles
645971 como dec a hip crates no existen enfermedades sino enfermos
645972 poner soluciones desde la justicia es muy complejo la justicia se lamenta siempre llega tarde a estas situaciones hasta que se pone en marcha
645973 cada vez son m s frecuentes indica el juez de familia los cambios en la guarda y custodia de los hijos
645974 si la justicia actuara con m s agilidad de una forma m s r pida cuando tiene constancia de un caso de alienaci n las cosas ser an m s sencillas
645975 la conveniencia del an lisis de la problem tica que se conoce como s ndrome de alienaci n parental en la evaluaci n psicol gica tanto dentro del mbito forense del derecho de familia como de otros relacionados
645976 una alteraci n cognitiva conductual y emocional en la que el ni o desprecia y critica a uno de sus progenitores
645977 debe descartarse por completo la existencia de cualquier forma de maltrato o negligencia en los cuidados del ni o asegur ndose de que las cr ticas no se refieren a conductas o actitudes reprochables por parte del familiar rechazado
645978 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
645979 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
645980 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
645981 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
645982 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
645983 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
645984 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
645985 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
645986 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt
645987 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
645988 tell me i am dreaming when this and that happens
645989 though exact count is not yet known the number of dead is over 50
645990 about 80 people have died and about 30 are injured as per latest reports from bilaspur district
645991 local shepherds from the gujjar community had guided infiltrators through craggy mountain shepherd pathways
645992 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
645993 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
645994 such baseless accusations serve no purpose other than vitiating bilateral atmosphere
645995 it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalised counter terror mechanism which is functioning satisfactorily

646000 estados unidos es el mayor mercado mundial de drogas il citas
646001 la raz n principal por la cual los pa ses andinos se enfrentan a dificultades para doblegar la producci n de drogas particularmente de coca na es la gran demanda que existe en estados unidos
646002 el verdadero problema de la regi n no es causado por la regi n es causado por lo que ocurre en las calles de nueva york en las calles de todas nuestras grandes ciudades
646003 a menos que se reduzca la demanda interna de drogas subsistir n los incentivos en m xico y otras naciones del sur para producir lo que nosotros consumimos
646004 en harlem el barrio negro marginal ubicado cerca de los rascacielos de la famosa 5 avenida de nueva york es moneda corriente ver a los chicos y adolescentes con jeringas con las que se inyectan cualquier clase de droga sobre todo el crack que es mucho m s barato que la coca na
646005 hemos visto lugares en estados unidos donde realmente hemos perdido el control de la seguridad p blica y lo que estamos intentando hacer es recuperarlo hay lugares donde 10 a 15 personas con armas ak 47 est n cultivando mariguana al aire libre y est n dispuestos a defender esos campos con esas armas
646006 el problema ha crecido y tememos que el peligro aumente hay una enorme invasi n de narcotraficantes mexicanos creando plantaciones de marihuana en territorio de los estados unidos
646007 estas organizaciones se han vuelto m s poderosas y son una amenaza grande para m xico y para los estados unidos debido al dinero que los consumidores estadounidenses aportan a estos narcotraficantes
646008 no tengo los detalles de nuestra producci n de marihuana pero s que somos autosuficientes
646009 ee uu es el m s grande productor de marihuana en el mundo
646010 s lo entre diciembre de 1999 y diciembre del 2000 se fumigaron 60 000 hect reas de cultivo de coca en colombia las fotograf as por sat lite encargadas por estados unidos y la onu demostraron que a pesar de ello las zonas de cultivo se incrementaron en 162 000 hect reas pero el glifosato ya hab a cumplido su misi n hab a arrasado la biodiversidad amaz nica liquidado los cultivos agr colas del campesinado y los animales dom sticos de miles de empobrecidos y sencillos campesinos del sur de colombia y noreste de ecuador
646011 altos miembros del gobierno de el presidente george w bush est n implicados en ese comercio y el sistema financiero est infiltrado por el narcotr fico y desde el punto de vista practico han fracasado estrepitosamente
646012 no solamente carece de autoridad moral sino que desde el punto de vista pr ctico en la lucha contra el narcotr fico ha fracasado estrepitosamente y hoy en d a utiliza la lucha antinarco como bandera pol tica
646013 resulta evidente que los flujos sumados de dinero blanqueado y dinero negro cubren buena parte del d ficit de la balanza de pagos norteamericana que alcanza cientos de miles de millones de d lares por a o
646014 la mayor a de los traficantes que est n en nuestras prisiones fueron condenados en base a menos evidencias de las que nosotros hemos conseguido acumular
646015 es hora de que george bush empiece a pagar por lo que hizo
646016 el informe presentado por el eir de 120 p ginas de extensi n es un compendio de documentos oficiales transcripciones de audiencias legislativas fotos organigramas y gr ficos y sostiene que bush facilit la creaci n de una red de tr fico de armas y drogas para apoyar a la contra nicarag ense que en 1984 hab a dejado de recibir oficialmente la ayuda norteamericana
646017 el eir asegura tambi n que bajo un manto de secreto pilotos privados conocidos como narcotraficantes llevaban armas y pertrechos a los contras en centroam rica y luego regresaban a estados unidos con cargamentos de drogas
646018 ese peri dico en base a documentos oficiales testimonios judiciales y entrevistas asegur que la cia reclut a narcotraficantes nicarag enses para recaudar fondos para su guerra contra el gobierno socialista de managua seg n el diario las autoridades estadounidenses hac an la vista gorda mientras los nicarag enses le vend an coca na barata a las pandillas negras en los angeles
646019 tengo las manos atadas porque son operativos de la casa blanca
646020 distribuir coca na en forma de crack entre los j venes de los ghettos es una forma de guerra qu mica que cost m s vidas y destruy m s familias que una guerra convencional
646021 cuando se trata de adicci n los ricos van a betty ford cl nica para las estrellas de hollywood y los pobres a la c rcel
646022 estamos llevando a cabo una guerra contra la droga o es esto una versi n estadunidense de una limpieza tnica
646023 hubo instancias en que la cia no cort de manera expedita o eficiente sus relaciones con individuos que apoyaban el programa de los contras y que alegadamente estaban involucrados en actividades de narcotr fico y no tomaron medidas para resolver las dudas
646024 en realidad la cia no es solamente una agencia de espionaje del gobierno de estados unidos es una de las maquinarias de narcotr fico subversi n y terrorismo de estado m s potentes que haya conocido la historia humana
646025 tan grave como lo anterior es que la cia utiliz la expansi n del consumo de narc ticos dentro de los barrios negros como una manera de implementar una limpieza tnica
646026 las grandes epidemias de drogadicci n han coincidido con las guerras secretas que la cia ha desarrollado en el tercer mundo
646027 1978 fue el a o en que se inici la gran operaci n de hacer a iberoam rica una vasta colonia productora de drogas en ese entonces jimmy carter el presidente estadounidense nombrado por la comisi n trilateral sent las bases para que la banca estadounidense se pusiera a la par con los narco bancos m s grandes del orbe o fuese absorbida por ellos

646033 los pa ses esperan que con obtener el visto bueno del fmi se le abrir n las puertas del cr dito de otros paises y de los bancos privados pero la aprobaci n del fmi requiere que se apliquen con buen xito sus programas si no se tiene xito entonces se seca la corriente de fondos de los bancos y los mercados monetarios esto quiere decir en primer lugar que los ministros de gobierno deben responderse la siguiente pregunta qu exportaciones pudieramos emprender que redit en ganancias inmediatas en efectivo para salvar esta brecha de la balanza de pagos s lo hay una mercancia que satisface este requisito las drogas

646058 the pipeline costs in southlake are twice what they are in other areas with the drop in the price of natural gas
646059 my perception is this was at least a partial statement to indicate chesapeake was not thrilled with our ordinance at the same time chesapeake did not indicate they were going to stop doing business in southlake but theyre slowing down

646070 yes but in the wrong hands it might be even more deadly
646071 its very important for the citizens of texas to remember that jose medellin brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two teenage girls in houston
646072 the world court has no jurisdiction here in texas were concerned about following texas law and thats what were doing
646073 if the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of u s citizens
646074 mr perry can flex the states judicial muscle and show the world that texans dont bow to the whims of some distant obscure international court
646075 but it would send an unequivocal message to all foreign governments especially mexico that this country doesnt stand by its promises
646076 this was a truly despicable crime committed by deadly brutal young men who were deadly dangerous to anyone who might find themselves near them all five were sentenced to death by separate juries after hearing all of the evidence in each of their individual trials
646077 no matter how long the courts of this state this nation or any other nation review re review and re review once again the disgusting facts of this crime and these perpetrators the result should be the same these juries reached a reasonable verdict beyond a reasonable doubt that a sentence of death was the only appropriate punishment under texas law

646100 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
646101 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north
646102 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line

646123 it is almost impossible to operate one of these in a legitimate way

646130 when will political leaders start listening to the people and their true needs
646131 people must start forming syndicates all the tax money that people pay must first go to the syndicate before it goes to the government the government first has to explain how they want to spend it and need the approval of the people the fastest way to get the power to the people is to stop the money going to the government do you know a quicker way to stop the war in iraq but who has the guts
646132 even when the leaders in washington say were not going to let the terrorists change our way of life they are implementing policies that do precisely that
646133 theyre using peoples fear of another terrorist attack to move forward with various government programs that the government has wanted to gather and put in place for many many years theyre using the fear which is now driving public policy in this country which is very unfortunate and very un american our leaders are shamelessly playing on that fear to implement and grab power
646134 but yes theres nothing we can do it does not matter how we vote they just do what they like

646143 de luchtkwaliteit in peking geeft reden tot bezorgdheid maar door ons uitgebreide onderzoek kunnen we nu elke atleet apart opvolgen

646181 somebody asked me the other day what i thought of illegal downloading and i thought you know what i dont care because i think the majority are kids and as they get old and get more income theyll probably buy records its just making music a part of everyones lives
646182 well i mean it can go two ways there are pros and cons to everything some people think it creates illegal access but i think the big wheel is round yknow
646183 duffy notes that access to music is all important but due to where she lived in her childhood she had no easy access herself having to take a two hour bus trip to get to a good record store
646184 it basically gives people access whats the harm in that
646185 the way burke is acting is as if the 1973 amendments never took place

646187 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
646188 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
646189 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
646190 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
646191 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
646192 it seems to me the only thing he wants us to do is inflate tires
646193 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare

646422 sama sekali tidak ada pembatasan usia untuk bergabung dalam organisasi ini
646423 ikm di depok sudah ada sejak tahun 1978 saat depok maish berstatus sebagai kecamatan
646424 hingga tahun 1990 cukup banyak kegiatan yang dilakukan oleh ikm dalam kontribusinya membangun kota depok
646425 ini juga sejalan dengan perkembangan depok yang dulunya hanya kecamatn lalu berubah menjadi kotif hinga sekarang menjadi kota otomotis jumlah etnis minang juga bertambah karena wilayahnya juga semakin luas
646426 jadi ikm yang ada saat ini bukan ikm yang baru melainkan melanjutkan ikm yang dulu berdiri pada 1978
646427 alhamdulillah hingga saat ini misi tersebut belum berubah jadi belum ada keinginan mengubah organisasi ini untuk berkecimpung di ranah politik misalnya
646428 selepas sma saya melanjtkan kuliah di lampung setelah wisuda saya kembali ke depok hingga sekarang
646429 depok tempo dulu dengan sekarang jelas berbeda dulu kota ini masih rapi dan bersih berbeda dengan situasi sekarang yang sudah diliputi macet di mana mana
646430 dulu walaupun jalannya kecil tapi kondisinya baik tapi sekarang jalan rusak dengan mudah ditemukan di mana saja
646431 saat ini yang diperlukan adalah pemahaman kepada warga minang bahwa organisasi ini dibutuhkan untuk membantu masyarakat minang yang diperantauan jika mereka sudah tertarik dengan ikm otomatis nantinya mereka akan bergabung dengan sendirinya
646432 tujuan awal didirikan paguyuban kelompok masyarakat ini tentu tidak jauh berbeda yaitu untuk menjalin silaturrahmi sepanjang mereka tidak menutup diri dengan masyarakat sekitarnya saya pikir ini adalah hal positif
646433 artinya kita dituntut untuk bisa beradaptasi dengan lingkungan sekitar di manapun kita berada
646434 peran ui yang konkret dan sudah jelas sebagai taman kota taman rekreasi dan tempat resapan air warga depok
646435 harusnya di sekitar sempadan sungai itu dibikin areal khusus untuk kepentingan publik misalnya taman atau jogging track sebab wilayah itu bukan wilayah privat tapi milik umum jadi akses untuk masyarakat umum juga harus diberikan
646436 selama ini margonda hanya dijadikan kawasan bisnis dan tujuan tujuan sempit sehingga untuk menatanya menjadi agak sulit tapi itu tetap harus diperbaiki
646437 jalur khusus kanalisasi angkot atau dikenal umum angkotway itu kemacetan bisa dikurangi
646438 angkot penting tapi saat ini angkot jadi sumber kemacetan utama di depok

646457 believe me if i thought there was any evidence at all that drilling could save people money who are struggling to fill up their gas tanks by this summer or the next few years i would consider it but it wont and i wont

646471 it looked in a bit of doubt but we managed to have the legs at the end and kick those crucial goals
646472 it was a big game for both clubs so to come out with the points in such a close contest was fantastic
646473 were one of only three teams to beat them this year so it should be a good contest
646474 were now six points in front of brisbane and if we keep winning were clear of the log jam but if we lose a game or two were very quickly back in the ruck
646475 were definitely not even looking at the top four yet because if you drop a game you might be out of the finals race before you know it

646482 die bundestagswahl 2009 ist f r die sozialdemokraten leider wohl jetzt schon verloren hoffentlich verbrennt die partei in dieser hoffnungslosen schlacht nicht ihre wahren spitzenleute wie frank walter steinmeier eigentlich muss man sich einen m glichst eindeutigen sieg der cdu fdp w nschen damit die spd endlich aufwacht je gr er ihre schlappe desto heilsamer wird vielleicht der schock
646483 aus europ ischer sicht kann ich mir daher nicht so richtig vorstellen warum wir uns einen pr sidenten obama w nschen sollten
646484 dass die partei in der angela merkel wirkt aus einer partei hervorgegangen ist die seinerzeit mit den nazis zumindest indirekt kooperiert hat das ist eine historisch zutreffende darstellung
646485 die schweigepflicht des rechtsanwalt dient allein dem schutz des mandanten und nicht dem schutz des anwalts
646486 dabei hat doch allein die nominierung obamas gezeigt in welch erstaunlichem ma e sich die us gesellschaft von rassischen kriterien f r die tauglichkeit ihrer politischen repr sentanten emanzipiert hat was aber nicht sein darf kann nicht sein die bohrende frage nach obamas schwarzsein suggeriert diese wandlung k nne doch wohl nicht ganz echt sein der rassismus soll auf immer und ewig als ein besonderes amerikanisches charakteristikum an den usa kleben bleiben und das obwohl immerhin bereits das us au enministerium zu zweiten mal hintereinander von einer person schwarzer hautfarbe besetzt ist und das unter der angeblich so reaktion ren republikanischen administration george w bushs um zu ermessen was in den vereinigten staaten in den vergangenen drei vier jahrzehnten in dieser hinsicht erreicht wurde gen gen weitere gegenfragen k nnen sie sich vorstellen dass zur bundestagswahl 2009 ein t rkischst mmiger deutscher als spitzenkandidat einer der gro en volksparteien deutschlands nominiert wird dass ein politiker mit marokkanischem vater und arabischem namen nicolas sarkozy das amt des franz sischen pr sidenten streitig machen k nnte oder dass ein afrikanischst mmiger politiker f r den posten des eu kommissionspr sidenten in frage k me
646487 i am excited about the expanded coverage we are offering to our clients with these new categories
646488 we are leading the way as one of the internets finest and most extensive coverage of the celebrity and entertainment world
646489 man solle nicht auch noch die letzte butter vom brot kratzen
646490 it would appear that ambulances arent the only things john edwards has been chasing lately
646491 according to the enquirer edwards entered rielle hunters hotel room around 9 45 p
646492 if only republican larry craig had been in the bathroom the msm might have covered it
646493 itll be down the road before he can jump in there and feel good
646494 obviously he has to feel comfortable with the leg and the knee to get out there and push yourself so ive been preparing as though i wont have him
646495 itll probably be the middle of two a days before hes back going full
646496 they are really going to have to compete to get themselves into a starting role
646497 they are going to have to really step up and see if there is any place for them besides possibly being a backup both were injured in the spring so they were never full speed
646498 but it is a good situation for those guys to have an opportunity to contribute early
646499 forte is out there as a leader and im sure hes making sure those kids are where they are supposed to be
646500 as a matter of fact i actually suggested him to become the athletic director to dr white
646501 i remember it so vividly because they didnt know him had not met him of course knew of him
646502 i was sort of singing his praises after the interview it was sort of a done deal
646503 i mean he was so impressive and fanny long was so impressive that i remember when he left the interview there at the airport at pittsburgh that we all looked at each other and said i think weve got the guy
646504 i think youll find me to have the philosophy that you hire really good people and you let them run their shop and you try to stay out of their way
646505 any of the major issues that happen he keeps me up to date and apprised so my philosophy is to let him run his operation and i feel the same way about all the vice chancellors
646506 ive heard that and i know that theres that perception out there but you have to do what you have to do at the time
646507 its hard for me to criticize or to cast any stones because i wasnt in his shoes
646508 i guess what i would say is hes not me and im not him he brought some amazing leadership to the whole university and to athletics that i probably wont bring and i hope that ill bring some new and different things that maybe he didnt bring
646509 i think thats why change is good i think thats why he decided to retire early you know he could see the time had come he felt i think good about what he had done
646510 he has kept me informed about decisions he wants to make and the direction hes going in
646511 ive interviewed a number of the new staff people that hes brought in or is bringing in so ive certainly been involved but hes the guy whos the expert he knows what works best in the program
646512 having him there i think is critically important to the whole university and to me in managing this whole enterprise
646513 i am very very impressed with his ability to get things done he wants to do things the right way he wont tolerate doing things in short shrift i have the utmost respect for him
646514 hes smart hes articulate i think he projects the right image that we want to project as a university and an athletic department
646515 you know we want to try to correct it immediately
646516 i think they have taken steps to do that we wanted to send a clear signal of no tolerance i think weve done that i think we have to continue to educate our student athletes as to the importance of the need to be good citizens i think were doing that
646517 weve seen where they have times they cant maintain their focus
646518 they arent used to having that many balls thrown at them
646519 i thought london crawford came out of spring with some confidence in himself and confidence by the quarterbacks
646520 hes certainly a very strong physical guy that i think we can really utilize when cornerbacks like to come up and press
646521 thats one of his strengths beating the corner at the line of scrimmage simply because of his combination of strength and speed
646522 hes catching the deep ball and needs to continue to work on that some of it has to do with his eyes and locating the ball and getting his hands in proper position certainly things that we can correct
646523 i think marques wade showed some signs that he can be a factor for us
646524 he did catch some deep balls and he got better each week in his route running
646525 he needs to get stronger in his waist and his lower body so he doesnt get knocked off balance so that when someone hits him or pushes him hes able to stay in stride and finish his routes
646526 salters came out of spring with confidence that he can work inside against the linebackers and catch the ball over the middle
646527 he has very good hands he can catch the ball in traffic because of his hands he can catch it away from his body
646528 were going to continue working with him on running after the catch and also on his speed and being more of a threat down the field
646529 we went to a lot of big time tournaments and we won three we went to the final four four times and that was big time we made it to the elite eight in the showcase we made it in the top 10 at nationals and thats a real good thing to do in my last year
646530 i think i performed well in every game and the coaches had a lot of fun watching me pelphrey was one of the coaches in attendance at virtually all of waltons games this summer and walton took notice of pelphreys persistence
646531 for coach pelphrey the head coach at a big time school like arkansas to be at every one of my games means a lot
646532 it shows that he is really interested in me coming to be a part of his team and this arkansas family walton has offers from schools across the nation and said hes close to ending the recruiting process
646533 i think i will make my decision at the end of summer and the beginning of my senior year
646534 we got to play against each other down at the baylor camp
646535 we just went against the arkansas players and that was pretty tough but i can hold my own against them trent like walton felt he had a good summer and did some things to attract interest from many of the coaches who saw him play
646536 there was a lot of things i was working on during the summer
646537 i have narrowed it down to california arkansas unlv washington and maryland
646538 i saw the facilities last year and i love the weight room
646539 his first two at bats he was a little impatient swinging at the first pitch
646540 that one he let travel a little bit and hit it out of the yard
646541 to fight back in the seventh and eighth and then to win was huge to me
646542 weil sie eine so gro e und starke familie wie meine nicht sehen will

646560 como americano doy por garantizadas muchas ideas que est n en proceso de serme negadas y mi actitud al respecto es
646561 us to be like him because we see him as he is
646562 those in hell for ever and ever will not be reconciled
646563 but he went to all the earth so that people could be save where ever they were
646564 christ of god thus shows his superiority to all rulers by entering into their several provinces amp summoning men out of them to be subject to himself
646565 during the forty days between his resurrection and his ascension walked with unequal giant strides over the earth and that wherever he set down his foot a church must be built in the sequel of time should this pious story be truthful it would be evident that christ strode over our hemisphere in many directions
646566 i always had faith in my team its a great comeback and im specially happy because everyone contributed to the cause
646567 veeru sehwag and gautam gambhir gave us fantastic starts which was crucial later harbhajan and ishant bowled well to guide us to victory
646568 there are a few grey areas which we need to address we have to ensure that if put in those conditions we can come out on a better note
646569 its still on trial and i think it needs good look in both the captains would sit with the umpires match referee and officials at the end of the tour to discuss those issues
646570 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
646571 let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall 1 corinthians 10 12 esv

646574 estamos mostrando que temos condi es de seguir na ponta apesar de s vezes existir uma certa desconfian a sabemos o que estamos fazendo e queremos continuar assim
646575 vivemos um momento importante mas ainda cedo para falar em t tulo
646576 os jogadores est o disposi o que bom sinal de que o grupo se qualifica mas a seq ncia mostra que os jogadores que est o em campo est o merecendo essa chance
646577 eu estou me sentindo nas olimp adas vemos as equipes atletas de todas as partes do mundo vimos como diferente j chegamos ao hotel e fomos revistados cadastrados tem toda essa burocracia deu para sentir como esse evento
646578 o futebol brasileiro merece essa medalha e tenho vontade de fazer parte desse grupo por isso o desejo de jogar
646579 tento me virar com o b sico do ingl s com o pouco que sei no hotel todos falam ingl s mas a l ngua n o uma barreira
646580 legal diferente do que estamos acostumados voc v a movimenta o nas ruas os atletas chegando com todas as delega es o clima gostoso mas ficar melhor quando jogarmos
646581 eu acho que vou jogar na abertura das olimp adas tanto que j estou preocupado com o nosso primeiro advers rio b lgica nem penso muito na les o
646582 como foi pancada na hora achei n o seria nada de grave mas senti dores e achei melhor pedir substitui o
646583 hoje estou com 70 das minhas condi es ainda sinto dor no local
646584 ainda cedo para definir alguma coisa at porque hoje foi o primeiro dia que tivemos condi es de tratar o jogador aqui na china
646585 acredito que em 48 horas ele estar pronto para trabalhar normalmente com o resto do grupo
646586 a estrat gia foi repetir a rotina desde a hora de acordar quando comer at o momento de competi o na capital chinese
646587 o primeiro dia o mais importante da gin stica pois quando se decidem as classifica es
646588 melhor imposs vel o palco fica na mesma altura de como ser na competi o n o no n vel do ch o isso muito positivo pois treina se nas mesmas condi es de prova com certeza a melhor instala o dos ltimos cinco jogos ol mpicos
646589 o p dio joga um pouco mais impulsiona as condi es s o perfeitas
646590 eu acho timo que tenham mais atletas hoje temos seis meninas boas o que a gente queria era que as pessoas conhecessem e gostassem da gin stica art stica natural que queiram bons resultados n o vemos isso como press o mas como resultado positivo da nossa divulga o
646591 cada jogos ol mpicos tem o seu momento especial em sydney tudo era novidade em atenas estava com a equipe aqui estou com meu irm o
646592 o xavier foi uma indica o do departamento de futebol mas n o passamos da etapa de cogita o
646593 esse interesse vazou mas n o quer dizer que vamos contratar ou n o o jogador o problema que no corinthians um resfriado vira pneumonia
646594 soube agora que ele est em um clube de israel n o estamos negociando
646595 para este ano o grupo est fechado n o h press es por refor os o nico por m s o as oportunidades pontuais que o mercado do futebol pode proporcionar
646596 ele n o ir para l temos espa o para todos no elenco
646597 tivemos uma conversa avisei no coletivo que se ele paulo baier n o tivesse pedido para segurar teria iniciado com ele
646598 o paulo complementou no segundo tempo um time que vinha bem no primeiro tempo
646599 quando sai da derrota para o botafogo tive d vidas para escalar o time
646600 j tinha jogado com tr s zagueiros no n utico e tinha ido muito bem fico mais vontade assim chego mais na frente para cruzar fazer gol gra as a deus est dando certo
646601 a nica forma que preciso reagir continuar jogando da mesma forma
646602 estou me senti muito bem nestes dois jogos fiz gol no primeiro acho que atuei bem no segundo
646603 fico muito feliz por poder ajudar o palmeiras e ter esse reconhecimento da torcida havia uma cobran a de todo mundo at minha mas tenho procurado ajudar e gratificante ser elogiado pela torcida estou feliz por essa melhora
646604 quando jogamos eu e o vald via com dois atacantes tenho que voltar um pouco mais para ajudar a marcar quando estou sozinho tenho mais liberdade para encostar no ataque e menos responsabilidade de marca o mas isso n o faz diferen a fa o meu papel sempre da melhor maneira
646605 dei parab ns ao grupo do fluminense pela luta e entrega tenho de dar moral ao meu grupo pela luta que tiveram e n o tenho que falar muito se tivesse perdido sem lutar estaria preocupado mas minha equipe lutou e brigou
646606 n o quero mais falar de refor os porque parece que estou dando desculpa tenho de dar moral para os jogadores que est o aqui aqui tem pessoas inteligentes que pensam juntas pergunta sobre refor os tem de ser feita para diretoria
646607 esses assuntos ser o tratados pelo ant nio carlos diretor de futebol ou o presidente andr s sanchez ou at por ambos na ucr nia buscaremos a perman ncia do diogo rinc n mas tamb m vamos analisar outras coisas como a situa o do willian
646608 precisamos manter os p s no ch o porque essa uma contrata o muito delicada fora da nossa realidade financeira
646609 entrou muito dinheiro por isso dif cil t lo de volta n o temos receita para abrir m o de parte do que recebemos pelo mesmo jogador
646610 foi importante voltar depois de 45 dias parado mas ainda sinto falta de ritmo de jogo infelizmente n o pude ajudar a equipe a sair com a vit ria
646611 they wanted a girl who was exactly 5ft 2in tall weighed 7st rachael shown above earns 250 500 a day for rehearsals and 500 1 000 a day during the actual shoot but she says she only pulls in around 30 000 60k a year working as a body double and if a star is on tour or puts on weight shes out of work so she supplements her income with conventional modeling work britney shown above in rome on the shoot of all the celebrities ive known she has the largest entourage never fewer than 20 people but she was so sweet oh my god youre so cute she shrieked when she saw me
646612 i watched her like a hawk all the time i needed to capture her dance moves perfectly so when there were any shots that didnt require britneys face on the screen i could take her place we worked two 20 hour days and i never heard her complain once

646641 mijnheer orbaen al blijf ik hier tot vier uur deze nacht zitten
646642 na de vergadering kwam hij naar mij toe en zei
646643 t stad is van iedereen is een fantastische slogan maar als je die niet kunt waarmaken komt die slogan vroeg of laat als een boemerang terug
646644 we do believe its critical for people with mental illness to get the treatment they need
646645 because if i do i wont be able to sleep at all
646646 theres something very unique about this compound that has been proven through clinical studies to work across a wide range of mental illnesses
646647 you had 10 to 15 years of marketing in which the companies controlled the journal publications controlled the speakers bureaus controlled the dinners controlled the patient advocacy groups all of which communicated these drugs were a breakthrough
646648 from the outset defendants recognized the need to promote nonmedically accepted indications and nonmedically necessary uses as the key to blockbuster success for their respective antipsychotic drugs
646649 astrazeneca strenuously denies the allegations in these lawsuits most of which have been brought by private personal injury lawyers and will defend itself in these lawsuits
646650 fda and the courts have recognized that off label prescribing by doctors is not only lawful but may be essential to giving patients optimal medical care
646651 the decision to treat a patient using a medicine outside the scope of the labeling is a medical judgment made by the physician
646652 we can acknowledge that we are part of a multistate investigation of the drug
646653 astrazeneca intends to litigate these cases on the merits and will defend the cases vigorously
646654 a large part of the legal problems attributed to zyprexa if they exist are arguably due to the failure of the responsible federal agencies to prevent abuse
646655 because of my particular experience with my illness it was absolutely a miracle drug and ive been on it ever since
646656 ive never been this big and ive had four kids
646657 that particular use of it i dont think was marketed heavily as an off label indication by the company
646658 there are a lot of seniors that dont know about it
646659 any seniors that i come across i tell them about it
646660 more and more people are asking for it nowadays as theyre trying to stretch their dollars
646661 historically theyre not as willing to come in to accept assistance
646662 they get more local food it makes those dollars circulate in our community its win win
646663 theyre wealthy people theyre philanthropists they pick their causes but they like to win too
646664 we are where we are because we brought together everybody who is working on the everglades
646665 this is a guy who cares very deeply about the everglades and has put his money where his mouth is
646666 he became engaged very early on during the campaign and after
646667 george and paul liked to fish for tarpon in the everglades and thats how all this got started
646668 they thought florida bay was being trashed by sugar i agreed
646669 we simply would not be able to do the work we do without the foundations help
646670 the goal of all of us is to restore the everglades its not to get rid of sugar
646671 its about time somebody did it on the side of the environment
646672 if paul jones has the ear of the governor im thrilled
646673 the words i spoke to you are spirit and life
646674 8 plays through much of the line and ties to the theme of the olympics kicking off later this week on 08 08 08 three of the six olympic colors 5 rings white background 6 colors are represented in this pack of nike sportswear dunk highs that are available now at
646675 ive not had a chance to speak to him yet but well get that done over the next couple of days
646676 as for dominic shimmin well not be taking our interest in him further
646677 we chose zrinity to help improve our sender reputation and deliverability which is a business critical part of our communication with our customers zrinitys willingness to work with us in reaching our deliverability and business communication goals plus their efforts to create customized solutions was very beneficial in the decision making process the goal is to increase our ability to generate more highly qualified business leads and increase revenue using the zrinity email marketing system
646678 with the constantly changing rules of major isps setting up your own email servers is no longer the most cost effective way of handling bulk mail we now rely on our zrinity applications to manage this which in turn allows us time to focus on what is most important to our success our customers
646679 the refiling of the suit has asserted that the bush administration had circumvented the us constitution by authorizing wiretaps
646680 it is not a pleasant commute driving route 2 every day
646681 if i were to drive id just take my car to alewife station in cambridge and take the train from there
646682 ive noticed it ive seen more people in the parking garage its a great thing i think more people should be taking the commuter rail
646683 the goals of the project are to reduce travel time from a maximum of 90 minutes to approximately 60 minutes between fitchburg and boston while improving on time reliability from 83 percent to over 95 percent
646684 we expect that will be done in the next month
646685 its certainly cheaper than driving because you dont have to pay to park when you get there
646686 its awful theres always an accident that holds you up the train is a lot easier because you dont have to deal with route 2 and even if you miss an early train theres one 20 or 30 minutes later
646687 i do notice that when the weathers bad there will be more people on the train
646688 they want to avoid driving in snow and bad rain
646689 i usually take the 6 oclock or 6 30 train and by the end of the ride theres standing room only and that didnt used to be the case
646690 its faster its more efficient and reliable its easier on the nerves and its probably no more expensive than driving
646691 i think its the convenience and the price of gas thats making the trains more crowded
646692 i think that a more strategic location for a central parking lot would do more than anything to get people on the train
646693 it would speed up the commute for people as well
646694 people use the north leominster station because its convenient its right off the highway
646695 there was no choice the kids were crying and we had been stuck for hours somehow my husband pushed into the far right lane we stopped and helped the kids get out and pee on the causeway it was the only thing we could do then we were afraid to give them any more water and we just let them cry till they fell asleep in the back seat it took us about four more hours to make it to alkhobar after that
646696 we were running at about 30 percent occupancy thursday morning but by thursday evening we were at 100 percent and we remain that way
646697 everybody thinks im a millionaire because of all the papers saying how much money i was going to get
646698 everybody keeps saying oh come on ann dig it out dig it out i wish i did have it
646699 look we want to do something different we want to demystify it can we bring a camera down
646700 you know i like this idea let me think about it lets try it
646701 george would it be ok if i brought jack welch over tomorrow and you could you know show him around and show him the way ge is traded

646723 a language could tell you so much about the country its culture and the people in it
646724 making that connection with the language provides my unit with a large advantage in the operation
646725 i worked in that restaurant for four years and i worked with all arabic people and mainly arabic customers
646726 because of all of the opportunities i had a lot of practice with the language
646727 i wanted to do something different other than graduating high school and going to college
646728 i wanted to use my ability by experiencing the military myself so i joined the marine corps
646729 ross is an extremely intelligent and people savvy marine and people key off his attitude toward everything his spirit is always the same no matter how bad the situation gets
646730 our company wouldnt be half as successful as we have been if he wasnt here
646731 he works very hard everyday to ensure the company completes its mission
646732 the iraqis have to remain extra careful on how they act and what they say when he is around because of his ability to read them
646733 a pdss is a good chance for the incoming unit to get out there and get eyes on and learn more about what the mission entails so they can go back and see what they need to do or readjust within their planning sessions to get ready for their deployment
646734 the pdss also helps the incoming brigade finalize their plans once they get eyes on the battlefield
646735 it helps them visualize and allows the commander and the operations section to figure out what they are going to do
646736 our pdss will help us fill in gaps when during our analysis from what we see here
646737 when we came here now we can now visualize what the battlefield set is like so now when we go back to hawaii we know what to adjust and what to replicate in training with what it looks like here in iraq
646738 we will adjust what we are doing so we can fight the war when we deploy here
646739 this will be an opportunity for us to share what went well and what did not go well for us during our deployment for our incoming counterparts
646740 we need this is so we are ready to come back and take over when we hit the ground
646741 this pdss will set the conditions for a successful transfer of authority
646742 what we dont want to do is give the mission to the 8th mp bde and for it to go backwards a couple steps during the transition
646743 we want the 8th mp bde to continue with were we left off and continue to build on what we accomplished here
646744 we are moving the iraqi police forward to primacy with regards to security through law enforcement
646745 we want to know how to do the job when we get on the job in iraq
646746 we had a good operational background on the mission before we arrived because we have been corresponding with the 18th mp bde for the past five months now

646757 the chinese government has and is still trying to fool the world using the beijing olympics to cover its atrocities in tibet and its abysmal human rights record in china and abroad
646758 tibetans and supporters all over the world will make sure that the world sees the brutal face of china during and after the olympics
646759 the tibetan freedom torch represents the hope and aspirations of the tibetan people for freedom and justice and the commitment of people around the world to helping make this dream a reality

646766 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
646767 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
646768 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
646769 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

646803 saya tak butuh pengikut saya ingin saat memimpin pan ini lahir para pemimpin baru yang dicintai rakyat dan mampu mengelola negara
646804 mereka punya kreativitas luar biasa sehingga dicintai rakyat saya tidak ingin dikelilingi para pengikut saya ingin orang seperti mereka lahir jadi pemimpin pemimpin hebat

646844 across the country hundreds of wind projects comprising tens of thousands of wind turbines are on hold because no one wants to step forward and pay for upgrades that will primarily benefit others the obvious solution to this problem is a policy framework that will allow firms interested in building new transmission to collect the costs of the infrastructure investment from those who will benefit from it
646845 given that electricity transmission infrastructure typically remains in service for 50 years or more the cost of the investment for the average household would be equivalent to about us 0 35 per month less than the cost of a postage stamp

647020 hey buddy i have some challenges that are blocking me from buying my first home like not having any money for a down payment
647021 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
647022 i too came to know about it this morning on television
647023 john i knew you were a dirty summanubitch but youre tracking fleas around goddamn son
647024 its totally beyond me ive read somewhere that it has to do with water displacement though its incomprehensible to me
647025 arizona has the highest number of boats her capita of any state in the union
647026 ive read it in a number of places and its always stated as gospel fact in arizona
647027 my mom will be along in a minute or two she had to go pee
647028 i know you told me your name was not george
647029 i didnt know that you changed your name jennifer george is so much easier to say than jennifer and george was your fathers name i think george is absolutely perfect
647030 were going to file the paperwork for a name change first thing on monday morning
647031 that will be wonderful and well change your name to mary
647032 now you know how i feel when you flirt with all the men at a party pointing with your tits
647033 maybe we ought to go our separate ways when we get back to tucson theres never been much that held us together sure we fuck well together but that is hardly the basis for a relationship
647034 well split the blanket after we bike back to tucson
647035 she looks at me with a painful expression in her eyes
647036 im not biking back to tucson i dont care how you get back to tucson but im not biking back ive had enough biking to last me a lifetime
647037 i might have known it if you had your way youd deprive an old reprobate the pleasure of a little nip i can offer you some of ems fancy imported french wine
647038 to the diamond x and all the memories it represents
647039 you and emily sure had some good times out here
647040 its a wonder that em and i ever survived coming out to the ranch considering what we did
647041 the pair of you sure were a couple of hellions
647042 i remember one summer em and i were indian warriors we rode everywhere bareback with just a hand braided leather hackamore we got so we could hop onto a horse while it was taking off holding onto the mane
647043 i think em and i were both twelve that summer and its a minor miracle that we lived through it
647044 i was the first one to survive sure death that summer
647045 you know that upper large meadow in the northeast corner of the ranch the one they call cowboy flats
647046 em and i were racing across hanging on to opposite sides of our horses our heels dug in grasping the mane in one hand and shooting imaginary arrows at each other with the other
647047 its not easy riding like that in the best of times damn tricky
647048 em and i were racing for all we were worth urging the horses on screaming enough to frighten the birds into silence
647049 i dont think em and i went any place that entire summer at less than a dead run
647050 anyway were racing across the flats dead out and our ponies into it big time
647051 my mount i dont even remember his name though i do recall he was a four year old gelding caught both his front feet on something and he turned a complete flip in the air he landed on the far side of the flip on all four and he didnt even miss a stride
647052 i should have come off and landed in a broken heap on the flats busted and looking down a long tree studded valley to death
647053 i dont know how i held onto that pony but i know i couldnt do it again in a thousand years
647054 you always did have a good seat on a horse a natural
647055 nothing like emily i swear to god she could ride a deer or a pronghorn
647056 you remember that big white stud that was on the ranch the one that had never been ridden and was at least sixteen hands if he was an inch
647057 that same summer i let em talk me into cornering white cloud in a box canyon this is after we separated him from his mares he was none too pleased about that
647058 he was a mean son of a bitch but you always said he threw a lot of really good colts
647059 we had him in this narrow canyon steep canyon that he couldnt climb out of it was rocky and treacherous as all hell with about a quarter acre patch of grass with lots of boulders in it
647060 we strung our ropes across the entrance so that old bastard couldnt get out
647061 i wasnt really sure what emily had in mind though i was worried she might try something crazy
647062 we have him cornered there and hes snorting and pawing the ground and getting real excited with his nostrils flaring
647063 emilys walking up to him talking real gentle to him like she always does to horses and he charges her
647064 i thought she was a goner how would i ever explain it to everett and my dad
647065 at the last fraction of a second somehow emily steps aside grabs hold of the white devils mane and swings up onto his back
647066 this horse goes ape shit no bodys ever been on his back he sucking dirt and twisting and turning and bucking for all hes worth and ems got her heels dug in and only holding onto mane
647067 after a good ten minutes of this the old boy decided he wasnt going anywhere and he might as well settle down
647068 all the time that this happening im imagining em sailing off and being pitched onto the rocks i can see myself crying over her lifeless body bawling for myself as much as her
647069 as soon as he felt her loosen her hold the wily bolt of lightening from hell bucked her off she did a complete flip and i thought she landed on a boulder
647070 i raced over my heart in my hands i was sure she was dead my best friend was dead
647071 she missed landing on a boulder by a hairs breath
647072 when i got to her she wasnt moving and i thought sure she was dead
647073 she opened her eyes and sucked in air her breath being knocked out
647074 emily swore me to secrecy and this is the first time i ever told this story
647075 the last time i saw em was when her previous marriage was breaking up she called and made an appointment for a massage and a hypnosis session and she cried on my shoulder and i tried to comfort her
647076 she sent me an invitation to her current marriage i think its her sixth i lose track
647077 there was a time that we thought the two of you would probably get hitched i know for a fact that both lidio and everett were in favor of it
647078 besides em and i were best buddies how the hell can you marry your best buddy
647079 neither one of us wanted to marry the other even then we were aware that it would destroy the relationship we had and have to this day
647080 i waited a long time to get married but i found the absolute perfect wife for me
647081 em went and married right out the gate and shes been getting married over and over ever since i think shes bound and determined to get it right
647082 i think you touched on something its a crying shame that she cant have kids she really needs a baby or two to call her own
647083 i absolutely agree with you sometimes i dont wonder if that ride of white cloud isnt what messed up her plumbing
647084 i dont wonder that everett leaving her all that money didnt mess her up
647085 it didnt mess you up and you inherited a lot more than she did remember i was one of the executors of lidios will
647086 i think maybe it was because you went to school in europe and em only had the best of us schools
647087 i tried to talk everett into sending her to switzerland but hed have no part of it
647088 i try hard not to let money corrupt me too badly try not to be an asshole

647100 saving faith is a commitment to leave sin and follow jesus at all costs jesus takes no one unwilling to come on those terms
647101 his lordship or sovereignty neither is eternal salvation something that can be gained through barter but is lordship salvations interpretation of how a lost man is born again a barter system we will see if it is
647102 that includes an upfront commitment to performance that theme which runs like a thread through each of his three major lordship apologetics is a works based message that frustrates grace gal 2 21
647103 thus in a sense we pay the ultimate price for salvation when our sinful self is nailed to a cross it is an exchange of all that we are for all that christ is and it denotes implicit obedience full surrender to the lordship of christ nothing less can qualify as saving faith
647104 wholehearted commitment a desire for him at any cost unconditional surrender
647105 for the reception of salvation the free gift of god
647106 of a commitment to life long obedience and submission to the lord to receive his free gift of salvation at salvation there only has to be surrender to what the holy spirit is convincing and convicting of at the moment future issues may not even be on ones mind
647107 for salvation is found in dr macarthurs books which i have cited lordships exchange barter system does not need to be artificially attributed to dr macarthur because it is his position
647108 does nothing to negate the clear incontrovertible evidence of lordship salvations barter system
647109 but if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die 22 none of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him because of the righteousness which he has done he shall live 23 do i have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die
647110 and not that he should turn from his ways and live
647111 you have become estranged from christ you who attempt to be justified by law you have fallen away from grace
647112 it was not through law that abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world but through the righteousness that comes by faith for if those who live by law are heirs faith has no value and the promise is worthless
647113 as ive been talking with bridget over at my blog http onmywalk
647114 salvation is for those who are willing to forsake everything
647115 then he brought them out and said sirs what must
647116 i told you that you would die in your sins for
647117 there are no works involved in salvation if there are then scripture lies
647118 for by grace you have been saved through faith and this not of yourselves it is a gift of god not of works so no man can boast
647119 this is the work of god that you swing a hammer
647120 no enabling of the spirit first no what we did was heard and believed and were saved
647121 salvation is for those who are willing to forsake everything
647122 are you implying that a person could be converted and then walk away without love for christ or any desire to forsake sin
647123 he is born again since through believing he is born again and the bible says that salvation cannot be received by doing then believing is not doing
647124 genuine salvation should be followed by a genuine desire to serve and live for jesus christ
647125 well you need to believe in the lord jesus christ
647126 my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed out cisterns for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water
647127 turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is no other
647128 but now in christ jesus you who were once far off have been brought near by the blood of christ
647129 you are of your father the devil and your will is to do your fathers desires
647130 i preached that they should repent and turn to god
647131 for they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god
647132 what must i do to be doing the works of god
647133 a person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven
647134 work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
647135 you even said above that the problem was that lordship requires ones
647136 i hope that makes it clearer and that it wasnt too long
647137 it was really helpful to hear from the als association so we can know the care setting our als patients have come from and their orientation to end of life care

647152 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
647153 we dont know yet how similar they are to the motor neurons in als patients
647154 while the cells exhibit many properties that are typical of motor neurons we dont yet know whether they will be prone to degeneration that will allow us to mimic the disease in the culture dish and therefore to screen potential drugs
647155 project a l s has always maintained that collaboration between scientists is the answer to understanding and treating this disease
647156 we are thrilled to have catalyzed the harvard columbia collaboration that led to this discovery
647157 therapeutic use of the cells is probably a long way off
647158 right now there are safety issues with ips cells including a risk of cancer we also dont know how to reintroduce cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial all these hurdles need to be overcome first before we can think about using the cells to treat disease but we can start immediately to evaluate them as a tool for drug discovery
647159 we are excited to be able to facilitate and support truly important cross institutional collaborations such as this significant research effort by harvard and columbia

647189 o allah i seek refuge in you from knowledge which does not benefit
647190 you have kept my company for thirty years what have you gained in the course of these years
647191 i have gained eight benefits from the knowledge which is sufficient for me i hope my salvation and safety are embodied in them
647192 the first benefit is that i observed the creation and saw that everyone had a loved one and one passionately desired whom he loved and longed for
647193 the second benefit is that i saw that people were following their lusts and hastening towards the desires of the souls and i mediated on the saying of allah the exalted
647194 but as for whoever has feared the majesty of his lord and has refrained his soul from lust truely the garden shall be his resting place
647195 the third benefit is that i saw that every human being is striving to accumlate as much as he can from the wreckage of this world and then holding on strongly to it i mediated on the quranic verse
647196 what is with you must vanish what is with allah must endure
647197 the fourth benefit is that some people whom i observed think that their dignity and honour lie in the multitude of their family and large clans
647198 the most honoured of you in the sight of allah is the most righteous of you
647199 the fifth benefit is that i found the people slandering each other and speaking ill of one another out of envy of fortune power and knowledge i mediated upon the saying of allah
647200 it is we who divide their livelihood among them in the life of this world
647201 the sixth benefit is that i saw people becoming enemies of each other for different reasons i mediated upon the saying of allah
647202 verily satan is an enemy to you so treat him as an enemy
647203 the seventh benefit is that i saw everyone working very hard exhausting themselves to obtain food and sustenance tempted by doubts and forbidden things they degraded themselves in humiliation i pondered over the saying of allah the exalted
647204 there is no moving creature on earth but that its sustenance is dependent on allah
647205 the eighth benefit is that i saw that everyone relied on some created thing some on the dinar and dirham some on wealth and property some on trade and craft and some on creatures like themselves i mediated on the saying of the exalted
647206 and whosever places his reliance on allah sufficient is allah for him for allah will surely accomplish hi purpose verily for all things has appointed a due proportion
647207 work for the world according to your position in it work for your hereafter according to the length of your remaining in it work for allah the exalted according to your need for him work for the fire according to your endurance in it

647439 that rock face along with other areas along the corridor will continue to be monitored now that a whole lot of that rock has been released it probably makes it a little bit more safer in a perfect world wed do it in a more controlled fashion but there was nothing to suggest that a slide of this magnitude was going to happen

647540 porque las mujeres son hasta tres veces m s vulnerables que los hombres ante la infecci n por vih por razones biol gicas econ micas y sociales y porque en este contexto los microbicidas representan un cap tulo fundamental de una respuesta integral al virus del sida
647541 la eficacia de los candidatos basados en los medicamentos antisida se espera mayor que la de los dem s productos pero hay que dejar claro que no se est hablando de protecci n total sino de eficacia parcial
647542 no ser a necesario aplicarlo antes de cada relaci n sexual sino que podr a ser suficiente con un uso diario o en el caso de que se aplique mediante anillos vaginales la protecci n durar a todo un mes
647543 si una mujer est expuesta a una cepa del vih resistente al f rmaco utilizado en el microbicida que emplea seguir teniendo eficacia en la prevenci n de la infecci n
647544 si una mujer usa un microbicida de segunda generaci n sin saber que es seropositiva su virus desarrollar resistencias al f rmaco utilizado en el producto si es as podr esta persona beneficiarse de un tratamiento posterior que contenga el mismo f rmaco

647549 es w re zu w nschen und zu fordern da zu beginn der pubert t beide geschlechter ber die naturnotwendigen gegens tze ihrer sexualit t gr ndlich aufgekl rt w rden um einen kultivierten umgang in diesem bereich mit sich selbst und miteinander zu erm glichen jeder junge mann und jede junge frau sollten wissen wie gro beim mann die abh ngigkeit und das ausgeliefertsein vom m nnlichen trieb ist und wie ganz anders die naturgegebenen bedingungen bei der frau sind da beispielsweise grunds tzlich jeder normale mann in bestimmten situationen mit jeder beliebigen frau ins bett steigen kann w hrend grunds tzlich fast jede frau dazu erst eine gef hlsm ige beziehung entstehen lassen mu selbstverst ndlich gibt es auf beiden seiten ausnahmen und sind die bed rfnisse graduell sehr unterschiedlich aber das prinzip ist von der natur her gegeben und von gebildeten menschen anzuerkennen
647550 f r diesen schwerwiegenden unterschied zwischen mann und frau gibt es leicht einsehbare biologische gr nde w hrend der mann den naturbedingten auftrag hat f r m glichst viele nachkommen zu sorgen obliegt es der frau nicht nur f r die n chsten neun monate f r die folgen eines kurzen kontaktes die konsequenzen zu tragen sondern auch f r die anschlie enden jahre und in unserer gesellschaftlichen situation nicht selten sogar ganz allein f r mindestens 18 jahre die volle verantwortung zu bernehmen
647551 noch viel zu wenig bekannt ist da der mensch in seinem handeln selbst bei rein sachlichen entscheidungen letztlich von dem bin ren prinzip des lust und unlust empfindens gesteuert wird nicht anders als beim tier dem entsprechend ist ebenso fast unbekannt da ein wesentliches merkmal menschlicher kultur in der selbstbestimmten steuerung dieses prinzips besteht durch die schaffung von und der orientierung an idealen
647552 auch der zustrom religi s anders fundierter kulturen und die hoffnung auf eine multi kultur wird uns kaum mehr an humanit t bringen solange die naturbedingten antriebe des menschen weiterhin tabuisiert werden anstatt sie zu kultivieren es ist wohl h chste zeit da sich unsere gesellschaft zun chst einmal von den eigenen berholten traditionen l st und an natur und menschengerechteren werten orientiert um zu einer humaneren zu einer humanistisch orientierten kultur zu finden

647556 las buenas intenciones no son suficientes y se deben crear verdaderas pol ticas p blicas que funcionen y permitan la atenci n y prevenci n del vih
647557 los gobiernos han hecho poco para cumplir con sus reiteradas promesas de terminar con las violaciones de derechos de las personas que viven con vih y de quienes est n expuestos a un alto riesgo de infecci n

647579 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
647580 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
647581 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

647677 the government is now bailing out troubled participants and intervening in every market the securities and exchange commission has accused others of trying to manipulate stocks but the government itself is now the manipulator the regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out fannie mae fnm and freddie mac fre the creditors of bear stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities they have swapped u s treasury bonds for toxic securities t here are ways to manage the failure of bear or fannie and freddie in a fairer way if public money is to be put at stake first all the shareholders of these companies have to be wiped out management has to be wiped out and the creditors of bear should have taken a hit why did the fed buy 29 billion of the most toxic securities and essentially bail out jpmorgan chase jpm which bought bear stearns the government bailed out everyone even the unsecured creditors of fannie and freddie should have taken a hit sometimes it is necessary to use public money to rescue institutions but you do it in a way in which youre not bailing out those who made the mistakes in each one of these episodes the government bailed out the shareholders the bondholders and to some degree management
647678 most theories about congregational life are flawed from the start because they are based on an institutional and mechanical worldview such a view is not biblical instead it is fatalistic and self serving because the goal is to fix and preserve the institution for as long a life as possible such a worldview allows one to focus on mere organizational and institutional survival rather than following jesus onto the mission field for the purpose of fulfilling the great commission however the old and new testaments are based on an organic worldview they clearly show a bias for salvation history rather than institutional viability
647679 midway on the journey of my life i awoke to find myself alone and lost in a dark wood having wandered from between archaeologists absorbed in their speculations on the rites of the second century and modernists who wish to give as the extension of the franchise tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors it is the democracy of the dead tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking about all democrats object to men being disqualified by the accident of birth tradition objects to their being disqualified by the accident of death democracy tells us not to neglect a good mans opinion even if he is our groom tradition asks us not to neglect who love her but little and seldom have recourse to her how much more loving will she be to those who love her and often call upon her st alphonsus liguori does not loudly proclaim how we may come by a straight course will decay alas and will become dust it will come to the tomb which is the bane of all flesh but we are all part of christ pray to the lord that forgiveness of sins flows freely yea i shall enter where after lamentation have gone our brothers suited to the roman liturgy therefore other things being equal of the martyrs and tremble not before the successors of julian the apostate we are the sons of the crusaders take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i have set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood against me i was dumb and was humbled and kept silence from good things and my sorrow was renewed my heart grew hot within me as far as possible i go to mass every day this is a rosary as far as possible i kneel down and tell these beads evey day if you reject me on account of my religion i shall thank god that he has spared me the indignity of being your representative

647734 perhaps most ironic although it is controlled by some of the most powerful people on the planet the food system is inherently weak it has systemic and structural vulnerabilities that lie close to the surface of our daily lives all it takes to expose them is a gentle jolt
647735 what was weird was that the stories i was hearing about drought and farmers in desperation were very similar to the stories that had been told to me in india a couple of years before they were all about small independent farmers up to their eyeballs in debt they had borrowed hugely to make a go of it and then thered been a shock in australia it was drought in india it might be harvest failure in britain foot and mouth it only takes one small shock
647736 the figure that often stuns people outside the us when i tour with the book is that 20 of american fast food meals are eaten in cars people are incredulous and ask is that because americans so love their cars but living here you see how hard people work for a pittance with no healthcare no decent education not even a hint of a pension so its not surprising that the one hot meal you eat a day you eat off your lap thats where the food system becomes a lifestyle

647747 particularly so when the substance of the amendments is an attempt to give voters the ability to vote on a matter that the judiciary has by prior decision removed from the voters purview
647748 perhaps it should be beyond the province of the judiciary to rule on the form of a proposed amendment that is intended to reverse a prior judicial ruling
647749 you have to make sure theyre aware of it were a government of the people and so the court shouldnt be taking away their ability to have a say on something the courts already had a say on

647922 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
647923 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
647924 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
647925 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
647926 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
647927 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
647928 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
647929 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
647930 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
647931 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
647932 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
647933 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
647934 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
647935 she didnt talk about building an entertainment empire she just did it
647936 she didnt talk about losing 170 pounds she just did it and she didnt rely on a man to build her dreams she didnt bat her eyes
647937 but theres no more important proclamation than each of you here
647938 i can remember when we were kids when she had one turntable and a tape deck and would mix on that
647939 i told her you gotta have substance behind your trade so you can branch off and do your own things
647940 she took that same dj work ethic to her fight against obesity
647941 her life shows the world that anything is possible with discipline and believing in yourself
647942 i thought this guys not trying to sell her so shes fair game
647943 i asked her name and she said its khia but im going to be known as k swift i slipped her my phone number and you know she called me back
647944 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
647945 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
647946 hay que ir pensando que el partido del jueves es una final el m s dif cil siempre es el primero porque es un poco el que te da tranquilidad para jugar los otros dos
647947 es un equipo muy duro f sicamente no s si nos saldr n a esperar o no pero vamos a jugar hasta el ltimo partido de la misma manera
647948 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
647949 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
647950 i am really excited about the number of people taking time out to take a proactive approach to making citizens feel safe
647951 its not that we hope for an incident to happen
647952 its so we are prepared for an incident should it happen
647953 there is no more important job than to protect others from harm
647954 the ravens ongoing effort to do everything we can do to make the stadium secure
647955 we are never going to be totally ready for the unexpected
647956 im trying to understand what would happen if we emptied out the stadium
647957 every location is an eventual security target i dont let it get to me
647958 as per our information 30 children and 38 women have been killed
647959 you can see that little pop that little zip compared to last year
647960 he was trying to do it then but he just didnt have that burst
647961 i think its important in order for us to go back to being a productive football team
647962 thats being able to close out football games we need to be able to run the football more effectively and theres a lot that goes into that
647963 thats blocking the right people thats carrying the football correctly thats taking care of the football not putting ourselves in tough situations where we have to move the ball almost totally through the air at times
647964 rudi gained a lot of yards and made a lot of tough yards
647965 he was a player that at the end of the game actually became a stronger runner thats what we hope he gets back to
647966 if we can get ourselves in the lead we can let him do his thing thats the key where we can give him that extra seven or eight or 10 carries in the third quarter
647967 he looks like the rudi of old and thats exciting
647968 but this was the total package of putting everything together im a little older you have to do things different when you get older
647969 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
647970 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
647971 while my nine seasons there were filled with personal highlights like hitting my 400th 500th and 600th home runs in a reds uniform my biggest regret is that we were not able to win a world championship while i was there
647972 16 israel related technology headlines from the week of july 27 2008
647973 the key evidence concerned last months bombing of the indian embassy in kabul
647974 first of all it may be recalled that we have condemned this incident in the strongest terms
647975 against this background the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too there were bombing incidents in pakistan as well subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalised counter terrorism mechanism which is working satisfactorily

647993 im composing for as many as 21 films some will release this year and some will come out next year
647994 my days are really hectic as i have to do my regular work and judge the show but i have planned my days five days for my work one day for voice of india and one day for my wife
647995 though saawariya gave me the fame and identity i was working in the industry since a long time after saawariya i have gained recognition and people have started taking me seriously saawariya made a lot of difference in my life
647996 music is in my blood as i come from a family of musicians pyarelalji is my uncle fathers elder brother my father anand sharma was one of the best viola players of his times my other uncle gorukh sharma was one of the best guitarists who played for most of the films including the famous track of aashiqui
647997 i started as a key board player and then gradually shifted to music arrangements i did the first arrangement for hum dil de chuke sanam and many other films followed later i started background score with shatranj which starred divya bharati and went on to do the background score for many films including black and finally sanjay chose me for saawariya
647998 but the first composition that i did was for sanjays bajirao mastani which was later shelved
647999 the reality shows have introduced a huge number of talents there are 800 films being made in bollywood so i think there is an ample scope for all of them

648004 it takes three days to get a jet ski license but akshay explained the time constraints he did a three day course in 12 hours he got up at 6am and got his license by 7pm he had to give a written and practical test the action scene we have shot is one of the most expensive ones that bollywood has ever seen and has been directed by danny baldwin
648005 going through a theory and practical exam was like going back to school
648006 when we went for a reccee to australia we saw a lot of show reels and met a lot of technicians but we saw a clear synergy with danny as his style of action was exactly what we needed the beauty about the action in singh is kinng is that not only is it great to look at but makes the audience laugh as well
648007 it is similar only in quality these are very high end action sequences akshay had to be very careful in certain sequences for instance the scene in which he had to jump from one moving lift to another without supporting cables but akshay is akshay he did it with much panache and agility enjoy watching it in the film
648008 the wordings of the song are spicy enough and on top of that the visuals make it spicier choreographer saroj khan has come up with some excellent choreography i am happy with the way the song has shaped up
648009 the music of maan gaye mughal e azam has got a tremendous response and with the films release coming closer the sales are picking up gradually the music has definitely turned out to be a chartbuster
648010 it got to be too much for her she wanted to go unnoticed but people recognised her and started whispering she felt really weird

648019 shit theres this huge rat that comes to my room
648020 oh yes i know it comes through the vent above the window no
648021 it comes in through that thats like 11 feet high
648022 youre on time anyway can i have your french fries

648032 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
648033 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers
648034 however the data shows that the problem is much broader than just with minorities and low income households my belief is if we widen our lenses to see that this problem affects all segments of society we will change the tone and context of our approach to solutions

648042 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
648043 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
648044 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
648045 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
648046 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
648047 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
648048 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
648049 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

648192 many economists argue that globalization will not shift into reverse even if oil prices continue their rising trend

648201 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
648202 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
648203 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack
648204 in the past we were constrained by the time lapse between the completion of exercise and capturing the images

648210 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
648211 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
648212 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
648213 in the past many believed that cell specialization or differentiation was a terminal state there was no going back or getting young again
648214 but now not only do we know this reversion happens naturally we also have a very tractable genetic system in which to study it
648215 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
648216 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
648217 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
648218 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative stem cells under different conditions
648219 although it wasnt expected drosophila have clearly taken advantage of this biological capacity during metamorphosis
648220 the stem cell community is debating whether every mammalian tissue relies on conventional adult stem cells of the sort already identified in bone marrow and muscle or if instead there are facultative stem cells that can arise from differentiated cells within the tissue now we know that it doesnt necessarily have to be one or the other it could be both
648221 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
648222 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
648223 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
648224 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
648225 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
648226 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
648227 it is known that ports are contaminated what we are investigating is to what extent the contaminants therein reach aquatic organisms
648228 we take mussels from clean waters and place them at points we wish to analyse in order to see how much and what kind of contamination is accumulated
648229 the galician biologists are in charge of studying the consequences of the contaminants on the mussels we measure the concentration of the contaminants received by the mussels
648230 today tbt is banned but it is highly durable and it can still be found in waters
648231 these last are similar to dioxines and in the past were used in very powerful transformers they are also prohibited but are still present in the water
648232 we place 20 or 30 mussels mounted on plastic supports and inside gauzes and submerge them at a depth of two metres
648233 after a certain period we collect them for analysis of level and type of contamination accumulated
648234 in some cases the contamination is high and the mussels can die
648235 by using polymeric mountings we simulate chemically what the mussels do i e accumulate contaminants
648236 the situation in the port of bilbao is quite homogenous we have taken samples in the areas of getxo santurce and the exterior port bilbao in the basque country and the results are similar in each case on the other hand in vigo galicia we detected wide differences from one zone to another for example between water near a shipyard and the open sea
648237 we wish to know if our methodology and the sampling tools that we have developed are useful for this purpose
648238 on the one hand we have seen that zones supposedly clean are not as clean as we thought it is necessary to redefine the selection of these clean zones on the other we are also perfecting the tool that chemically simulates the role of the mussels in order to carry out even more precise sampling
648239 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
648240 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
648241 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
648242 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
648243 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
648244 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest

648250 mass circumcision campaigns will result in hundreds of thousands of complications and could make the hiv crisis worse
648251 there are already numerous reports of males lining up to get circumcised so they no longer will need to use condoms
648252 male circumcision is a dangerous distraction in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some degree of reduced risk per sexual incident individuals engaged in high risk behavior are still at risk for hiv and circumcision does not protect women giving circumcised males and their partners the false impression that they are protected will make the situation worse by increasing risk taking behavior further mass circumcision campaigns will likely overwhelm the already overburdened african healthcare infrastructure and divert resources away from other needed and more effective hiv prevention strategies

648286 especialmente esta vivienda de hasta 1 000 uf tiene subsidio del estado y es la que tiene menos variaciones en cambio la vivienda que es m s cara tiene fluctuaciones mucho m s grandes al tener el aval del estado los vaivenes son mucho menores
648287 en quilicura y maip ya tenemos todo vendido y en general esa es la din mica que se da en el negocio de este tipo de viviendas quilicura tiene la virtud de estar ubicado cerca de centros industriales y eso para nuestros compradores es importante y atractivo maip por su lado siempre ha sido atractiva es muy homog nea
648288 si bien la gente que compra este tipo de casas la mayor parte lo hace con subsidio y a trav s del estado siempre ser bueno que existan diferentes alternativas para financiar la compra de un bien como una casa
648289 quiz s fueron mal asesorados estaban mal informados o simplemente hicieron una apuesta que hoy no les est dando buenos resultados ya que lo ideal en aquel periodo era tomar tasas fijas
648290 recordemos que estaban desde el 3 8 con promedios alrededor del 4 lo cual era bastante bajo
648291 pero incluso en los ltimos tres meses ya podr an empezar a bajar y no vamos a ver niveles tan altos
648292 no ser a lo m s adecuado para estas personas repactar ahora una tasa fija sobre todo porque en su momento cuando las tasas estaban bajas no pensaron en ocupar una tasa fija por alguna raz n
648293 les conviene esperar que bajen las tasas y si no quieren estar expuestos a esta variabilidad cambiarse a tasa fija cuando el promedio haya disminuido en el mercado
648294 primero porque no hay indicadores de un alto endeudamiento de esos grupos y segundo porque las tasas tampoco han subido de forma tan violenta no es esperable que las tasas largas suban demasiado r pido en el corto plazo
648295 adem s el alza de tasas no es proporcional al aumento instant neo del dividendo
648296 eso no es posible calcular as solamente ya que hay que conocer el plazo del cr dito a medida que va avanzando el cr dito la configuraci n pago capital intereses va cambiando la cuota no sube al doble porque la tasa de inter s suba al doble la nica manera de calcularlo es con una simulaci n del cr dito

648311 research is revealing that male and female brains are built from markedly different genetic blueprints which create numerous anatomical differences

648324 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

648390 are you insane we dont have anything were poor people were not the insurgents
648391 this asshole was lying there was another man up there with an ak
648392 i know i know look you have an ancient object here a kind of container it should be an off green metallic not very big youve probably had it in your family for generations
648393 i know you can fucking understand me so heres what were going to do im going to count to three and if one of you havent answered him by then this kids going to be mince understood
648394 sorry sir but you dont know what the fuck youre doing youre not a fucking operational element in this mission youre just here to identify and take charge of whatever it is were looking for you do your job and you let us do ours
648395 you cant shoot an unarmed prisoner in cold blood thats a war crime
648396 i knew you werent black ops for all your bullshit you dont have the fucking stomach for war do you and dont think we dont know about your own little war
648397 your war in heaven the war in time weve read the unit files we know what asis and the cia and even c19 know you fucking aliens may be our allies but you dont know the first thing about winning do you ive read the stuff on your lot doctor a bunch of pussies acting like theyre gods because they have technology that we dont but now the enemy has that too dont they suddenly youre not so mighty anymore and youre begging borrowing and stealing your way through it youre down here using us as proxies to do your fucking dirty work so dont get all high and moral with me
648398 whatever the truth you cant do this it doesnt have to be like this we can find the container and leave
648399 leave just like that what do you think the enemy will do doc theyll catch up with this lot and exterminate them like cockroaches and before they do theyll make them spill their guts about what they know theyre already a threat to mission security
648400 the hell you will we arent going to risk that and we certainly cant take them
648401 i forbid you too many lives have been taken already
648402 this is what we do doc we handle this shit you can win the war and pretend to be the saviour and well give you the key this is what we do
648403 listen to me if you dont tell us where the container is it will be her next time
648404 we dont know we dont know what you want stop this
648405 well well so it is true the time lord comes to gain the key to winning the time war how badly do you want it little time lord how badly do you want to win
648406 tell them time lord tell them where the focus is hidden
648407 and this is the game time lord your soulless friends cannot kill me but you can destroy the baby time lord and the focus is yours
648408 its the failsafe mechanism its basic simple designed to keep primitive people from taking the container while allowing its owners to retrieve it
648409 so whats the problem the babys a fucking thing right its not real shoot the fucker and take it
648410 the container created a life around itself as the most effective protection it would be murder
648411 this changes nothing they were security risks and now they are not
648412 havent you been listening its not a thing and no you cant destroy it only i can
648413 in that case our mission here is over this shit is pointless doc well provide security for five minutes outside and then were leaving you said you had your own extraction
648414 use your time well then five minutes you know what you have to do so have the guts to do it
648415 good the nightmare child will soon be complete return the focus to gallifrey

648431 since effecting our business plan in mid december 2007 amax has consistently generated approximately 20 of the monthly vip rolling chip volume in the macau market and we believe we can continue to maintain this market share going forward
648432 we remain confident in our ability to deliver a monthly run rate of between hk 40 billion hk 50 billion in rolling chip volume with the biggest constraint on growth coming from restrictions on the addition of new gaming tables
648433 in addition following the expected implementation of a commission cap of 1 25 of rolling chip volume competition for vip players in the market will be based on the quality of each gaming facility as well as the liquidity available to be extended to junket promoters we believe the stability that will be established following the implementation of a commission cap will play into amaxs strength as we operate in one of the finest vip facilities in the world and have the ability to extend liquidity in a risk free manner
648434 amax is principally engaged in gaming and entertainment business in macau

648455 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
648456 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
648457 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
648458 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window

648468 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
648469 c d c s new incidence estimates reveal that the h i v epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
648470 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
648471 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
648472 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
648473 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
648474 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
648475 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
648476 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
648477 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
648478 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
648479 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
648480 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
648481 if there is any good news here it is hard to report it but there is a little bit in the sense that while incidence rates are certainly too high they are stable that is important because a stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with h i v and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
648482 the south is faced with a crisis of having to provide medical and support care for increasing numbers of infected individuals without adequate funding
648483 african american women are 83 percent of all new cases that we can document
648484 and the new epidemic is young people theyre between 22 and 24
648485 we have specific problems here in the south especially because of our rural areas transportation issues translation lack of access to proper health care
648486 some of those are parents in denial that their children are sexually active and people not getting tested
648487 people arent getting proper health care early on and are transmitting the disease to others
648488 even though we have now seen this increase in the south we are not seeing the increase in funding for the southern states
648489 rising infection rates coupled with inadequate funding resources and infrastructures
648490 a disparate and catastrophic situation in our public health care systems in the south
648491 there are vast geographic areas that encompass large cities less urban areas and rural areas that result in screening care treatment and housing challenges
648492 historically the south has also received the least amount of federal funding
648493 only 19 percent of u s philanthropic commitments for hiv aids
648494 age appropriate science driven education for prevention of all sexually transmitted diseases
648495 prevention treatment care and housing in the southern united states to rectify the historical inequities embedded in the federal hiv and std funding portfolios
648496 unless we act to correct funding and treatment disparities we endanger not just isolated communities but our states and our nation
648497 people in the south will die for lack of a simple test that can cost under 8 to provide so we must work together to provide early screening
648498 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead

648525 every application is dealt with on its own merits we dont fund everything that comes to our door however we funded this project because we felt it was economically viable
648526 we dont fund companies in the private construction sector most of the guys we have funded have contracts with the government or state owned companies

648601 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
648602 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
648603 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
648604 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
648605 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
648606 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
648607 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
648608 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
648609 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
648610 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
648611 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
648612 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
648613 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
648614 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
648615 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
648616 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
648617 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
648618 today i have decided to stand down as england captain to be honest it is the hardest decision i have ever had to make but also the easiest
648619 i am giving away the job i have loved for five years put my heart and soul into the job but my mind has told me to pack it in
648620 i feel if i kept going as captain my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career i am going to carry on playing i believe there are a lot more runs in me i hope this decision will help that
648621 es muy importante traducir las leyes pero tambi n otros textos de inter s para que los mapuches y no s lo ellos conozcan m s acerca de la ley de los derechos sino tambi n de la labor del congreso y de la vida pol tica de chile una cultura permanece viva si hay textos escritos
648622 por eso estamos empe ados en escribir tambi n lo que nos contaron nuestros antepasados ya que con el tiempo las versiones van cambiando y reinterpret ndose con lo cual se va perdiendo el sentido original y verdadero de las cosas en su contexto

648625 man wei nie ob sie die n chste nacht bersteht oder die n chste stunde
648626 sie sagte ja dann streckte sie die hand aus und stellte sich vor ich bin amy das ist heute nicht mehr denkbar
648627 damit k nnte ich mich zur ruhe setzen wenn ich es exklusiv h tte
648628 amy ist ein echter familienmensch sie ist eine wunderbare tochter eine wunderbare nichte eine wunderbare schwester
648629 amy ist nicht nur einfach anders sie fasziniert auch weil alle wittern dass da noch mehr ist
648630 sie ist mehr als nur eine vermasselte junge frau viel mehr fragt sich nur ob es die welt jemals zu sehen bekommt
648631 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
648632 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
648633 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
648634 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
648635 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
648636 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
648637 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
648638 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
648639 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
648640 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
648641 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
648642 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
648643 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
648644 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
648645 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
648646 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
648647 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
648648 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
648649 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
648650 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
648651 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
648652 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
648653 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
648654 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen

648659 if you were a son of mine i wouldnt want you to be an architect
648660 because its a tough way to be in the world look my son who graduated from law school three years ago makes more than i do after 40 years of working

648663 if all regions attempt to maintain high growth through macroeconomic stimulus the main result is going to be higher commodity prices and ultimately a bigger crash in the not too distant future
648664 in the light of the experience of the 1970s it is surprising how many leading policymakers and economic pundits believe that policy should aim to keep pushing demand up

648669 we will work with all local and state law enforcement units that specialize in art thefts including international agencies regarding the theft
648670 the u s anthrax attacks stand nearly alone in our database and anthrax has been used as a terror weapon very infrequently since 1970
648671 in 1993 the japanese group aum shinri kyo attempted to disperse anthrax in tokyo and in the area around japans parliament both attacks failed in fact there have only been a handful of bio chemical attacks of any type on record and perhaps the most prominent ones go back to aum shinri kyos sarin attacks in tokyo in the 1990s
648672 relative to explosives you need a lot of bio chemical materials to inflict mass casualties and the materials must be handled very carefully
648673 that doesnt mean bio chemical weapons dont pose a serious potential hazard but so far at least they have not been the weapon of choice
648674 we want to learn more about using the internet to get people to be more physically active
648675 given growing concerns over the state of the economy i think this is a very good showing
648676 it is proof of how well this university is connecting in the community
648677 our alumni are an increasingly important resource for unc charlotte
648678 their collective commitment of time talent and resources make a huge difference on campus
648679 we are dedicated to providing all students with access to the highest quality education
648680 the new bruin community school is one example of our significant and long term commitment to public school improvement through engaged scholarship and partnerships with community leaders organizations teachers and local government
648681 as partners in this effort we will all learn a great deal as we strive to ensure the educational success of our high need urban students
648682 i am very proud that we are part of this exciting new public school venture
648683 the ambassador site will include innovative programs and offer high quality education to the children in this community
648684 i thank ucla and other partners and look forward to seeing the benefits that these partnerships will bring to the community
648685 our teacher education and principal leadership programs together with our research on and commitment to community based schooling uniquely qualify us to not only support the bruin community schools instructional program but also to help shape urban school policy
648686 i am honored that president magrath has given me this opportunity to serve him my alma mater and my home state as wvus interim chief of staff
648687 during this transitional period i look forward to helping to make a great land grant university even better
648688 jay cole and i by chance became neighbors in our college board offices and i learned about his love for west virginia and its flagship university
648689 he wants to serve wvu by helping me and i am delighted he will do so as we all press ahead
648690 wvu is fortunate to have a man of jay coles experience depth of knowledge character and integrity assume an important role in the presidents office
648691 while we will miss his presence at the college board and will eagerly await his return when his appointment ends we know he will be a tremendous asset to peter magrath and the leadership team at wvu
648692 from academic research to international education to service learning jay has played a crucial and leading role in shaping west virginias higher education policy landscape
648693 he is an extraordinary choice to implement the vision of president c peter magrath and the west virginia university board of governors
648694 we are fortunate jay cole has been chosen by interim president magrath to be wvus chief of staff he has an extensive knowledge of higher education in west virginia and with his work at the college board he is well versed on higher education at the national level
648695 yes that is the essence of being human any person you meet at a party will be interested in his own life above all other topics your awkward silences can be solved by asking simple questions about the persons life
648696 first of all it would be like interrogating him secondly i couldnt possibly pretend to be interested in the answers if he turns out to be some shoe salesman living with his mother in albany my eyes will glaze over
648697 it would seem phony to you while you asked the questions but it would not seem that way to the stranger to him it is an unexpected gift an opportunity to enjoy one of lifes greatest pleasures talking about oneself he would become more animated and he would instantly begin to like you you would seem to be a brilliant and talented conversationalist even if your only contribution was asking questions and listening and you would have solved the strangers fear of an awkward silence for that he will be grateful
648698 that solves the strangers problem but i have to listen to this guy drone on about himself the cure is worse than the disease
648699 your questions to the stranger are only the starting points from there you can steer him toward the thing you care about most yourself
648700 wouldnt he want to talk about himself instead of me
648701 when you find out how others deal with their situations it is automatically relevant to you
648702 there will always be parallels in your life find out what you and he have in common then ask how he likes it how he deals with it and if he has any clever solutions for it perhaps you both have long commutes or you both have mothers who call too often or you both ski
648703 sure unless i have something to say i dont know how people can blab about nothing
648704 your problem is that you view conversation as a way to exchange information
648705 resulted in a razor sharp portrayal of the critical scientific underpinnings of climate change the series coupled this outstanding scientific reporting with real world impacts on real and local people and institutions
648706 powerful reporting on a previously overlooked aspect of the oil and gas boom in the rockies
648707 the ease with which this piece puts pen to paper and leaves lasting images in the readers mind belies the enormous amount of work that went into her exceptional reporting
648708 this system may be useful for the fly to navigate the olfactory landscape odor concentrations can change very dramatically and this is how they deal it
648709 we applied natural odors to the antennae odors that the fly would normally smell
648710 its like evolution has taken advantage of the system to adjust some channels up and down without affecting other channels
648711 if you want high sensitivity to co2 then you can eliminate the feedback receptor in those neurons for other odors such as pheromone which is important for finding other flies a good tracking system is needed
648712 flies that lack inhibition in their pheromone sensing neurons often fail to find the female
648713 the control flies are strikingly different soon after they get accustomed to the new arena they zoom in on the female and immediately start courting her
648714 she was such a dear person who touched the lives of so many of us in such special ways
648715 professionally she was the key person who trained us on all of the new student computer applications years ago making it fun to go to training sessions and easy to learn
648716 she was just a very caring person she was always concerned about others
648717 when she was a teenager she liked to surf over in santa cruz
648718 take the most mundane task and make it a fun event
648719 you know how they say the glass is half empty or half full for some people
648720 west virginia work and wages by major gender and race 2006
648721 the latest analysis reveals that education and health care graduates tend to have relatively high work participation rates
648722 in contrast we see lower work participation rates for certain science and technology related fields like biomedical sciences engineering as well physical sciences
648723 the reports findings reflect the importance of higher education to the economic future of west virginia and indicate the direct returns on the investment made by students and parents in their college education
648724 after years of thirst a voice like fresh water has arrived a cloud a love letter from another planet fairuz has overwhelmed us with ecstasy names and figures of speech remain too small to define her she alone is our agency of goodwill to which those of us looking for love and poetry belong when fairouz sings mountains and rivers follow her voice the mosque and the church the oil jars and loaves of bread through her every one of us is made to blossom and once we were no more than sand men drop their weapons and apologize upon hearing her voice our childhood is molded anew
648725 no people in the world manifest such enthusiastic admiration for literary expression and are so moved by the word spoken or written as the arabs
648726 if they fail in the recursion not recursion ive got to stop saying that i mean embedding because i mean if he cant get
648727 this is new stuff and they dont do new stuff
648728 but when theyre hunting they must have those skills of visual anticipation
648729 if id had a joystick for him to hunt the monkey
648730 the crazy thing is that this is already more realistic than the experiments aslin did with babies
648731 the cognitive issue here is the cultural impediment to doing new things he doesnt know theres a pattern to recognize
648732 is if we got a bunch of the kids and whoever points first gets a lollipop
648733 thats got an element of competition that they wont go for
648734 this is typical of fieldwork in the amazon which is why most people dont do it
648735 just because were sitting in the same room doesnt mean were sitting in the same century
648736 but well give him something because thats what he wants
648737 today sheldon endorses everetts claim that the tribe has no fixed color terms
648738 they have been made fun of by outsiders because they do things differently
648739 with researchers who dont speak their language they make fun giving really bad information totally wrong information sometimes
648740 we could try to get n s f money this could be big even for psychology
648741 theyre reacting to the immediate action on the screen with direct assertions about what they see
648742 i think dans is an interesting and valid additional approach to add to the arsenal
648743 i think you need to look at something as complex as language from lots of different angles and i think the angle hes arguing is interesting and deserves more work more research but as far as the pirah disproving universal grammar i dont think anything i could have seen out there would have convinced me that that was ever anything other than just the wrong way to frame the problem
648744 beginning to feel it for the first time after twenty five years
648745 this language uses prosody much more than any other language i know of
648746 its not the kind of thing that you can write and capture and go back to you have to watch and you have to feel it its like someone singing a song you want to watch and listen and try to sing along with them so i started doing that and i began noticing things that i never transcribed and things i never picked up when i listened to a tape of them and part of it was the performance so at that point i said put the tape recorders and notebooks away focus on the person watch them they give a lot of things using prosody that you never would have found otherwise this has never been documented in any language i know
648747 i realized oh thats what the subject verb looks like thats what the pieces of the clause and the time phrase and the object and the other phrases feel like that was the beginning of a breakthrough for me i wont say that ive broken it until i can creatively use the verbal structure and i cant do it yet
648748 he was diligent and he was trying to use his perspective and his training and i watched the last year that we were together in the village he just was like this is it
648749 pirah has just always been out there defying every linguist thats gone out there because you cant start at the segment level and go on youre not going to find out anything because they really can communicate without the syllables
648750 keren has made tremendous progress and im sure she knows more about musical speech than i do at this point
648751 theres probably several areas of pirah where her factual knowledge exceeds mine but its not all the prosody thats the thing
648752 it would be impossible for her to believe that we know the language because that would mean that the word of god doesnt work
648753 a lot of peoples view of chomsky is of the person in the lead on the jungle path
648754 and if anybodys likely to find the way home its him
648755 100 things of yg hip di era 90 an sumpah ini bikin kangen
648756 because mommy wants to stay healthy and have lots of energy so i can have fun playing with you
648757 xa i hi g sai xig aihiabisaoax i ti xabi hai hiat ihi xig o ho hi
648758 everett said in the tongues choppy staccato introducing me as someone who would be
648759 they want to know what youre called in crooked head
648760 thats completely consistent with my main thesis about the tribe
648761 they reject everything from outside their world they just dont want it and its been that way since the day the brazilians first found them in this jungle in the seventeen hundreds
648762 the man who is wearing a top hat is walking down the street
648763 i think one of the reasons that we havent found other groups like this
648764 is because weve been told basically that its not possible
648765 i have to wonder whether hes some borgesian fantasist or some margaret mead being stitched up by the locals
648766 they dont keep them around when there arent any planes its a chain reaction and someone else will do it but then eventually it will peter out
648767 usually you can hook people really easily by doing these funny little things
648768 but the pirah kids werent buying it and neither were their parents
648769 i want to see with my own eyes how much of this stuff that dan is saying seems to check out
648770 i dont think we had a book in the house
648771 to my dad people who taught at colleges and people who wore ties were sissies all of them i suppose some of that is still in me
648772 attracted me intellectually and because it looked like phoneticians could get rich
648773 they were loving and caring and had all these groovy experiences in the amazon
648774 they supported me and told me how great i was this was just not what i was used to
648775 i felt that my life had changed completely that i had stepped from darkness into light all the expressions you hear
648776 within about twenty minutes he can tell you the basic structure of the language and how its grammar works
648777 he has incredible breadth of knowledge is really really smart knows stuff inside out
648778 at that time we didnt know that pirah was linguistically so hard
648779 the stuff thats growing in this village was either planted by somebody else or its what grows when you spit the seed out
648780 for the first several years i was here i was disappointed that i hadnt gone to a colorful group of people
648781 i thought of the people in the xingu who paint themselves and use the lip plates and have the festivals but then i realized that this is the most intense culture that i could ever have hoped to experience this is a culture thats invisible to the naked eye but that is incredibly powerful the most powerful culture of the amazon nobody has resisted change like this in the history of the amazon and maybe of the world
648782 we struggled even getting to the place where we felt comfortable with the beginning of a grammar
648783 he kind of nodded and said in his way thats interesting
648784 but there was no spiritual understanding it had no emotional impact it was just a story
648785 we would say it just doesnt seem that theres any way that it does x y or z
648786 and the standard answer since this typically doesnt happen in languages was well it must be there just look a little harder
648787 sheldons anxiety over his slow progress was acute he began many mornings by getting sick to his stomach in 1977 after spending ten years with the pirah he was promoted to director of s i l in brazil and asked the everetts to take his place in the jungle
648788 there are very few places in the world where you have to learn a language with no language in common
648789 then you try to get the expression for two sticks and for one stick drops to the ground two sticks drop to the ground you have to act everything out to get some basic notion of how the clause structure works where the subject verb and object go
648790 you were trying to tell him something about your general state that bugs bother you
648791 they never talk that way and they could never understand it bugs are a part of life
648792 but im surprised he didnt know i was imitating an insect
648793 the movement of your hand the sound even the way we represent animals is cultural
648794 i went into the jungle helped them make fields went fishing with them
648795 you cannot become one of them but youve got to do as much as you can to feel and absorb the language
648796 so if you show them a red cup theyre likely to say this looks like blood
648797 or they could say this is like vrvcum a local berry that they use to extract a red dye
648798 christians who believe in the bible believe that it is their job to bring others the joy of salvation
648799 even if theyre murdered beaten to death what you do for god
648800 i wanted as little formal linguistic theory as i could get by with
648801 i wanted the basic linguistic training to do a translation of the new testament
648802 to come to know a human language would be an extraordinary intellectual achievement for a creature not specifically designed to accomplish this task
648803 by studying the properties of natural languages their structure organization and use
648804 we may hope to gain some understanding of the specific characteristics of human intelligence we may hope to learn something about human nature
648805 id been doing linguistics at a fairly low level of rigor
648806 as soon as you started reading chomskys stuff and the people most closely associated with chomsky you realized this is a totally different level this is actually something that looks like science
648807 i knew i was leaving out a lot of stuff
648808 whenever you try out a theory on someone theres always some question that you hope they wont ask
648809 chomsky sent me all the papers that he was working on
648810 i was like many of the scholars in that i made regular pilgrimages to sit in chomskys classes to collect the handouts and to figure out exactly where the theory was today
648811 chomskys theory only allows you to talk about properties that obtain of tree structures
648812 varies as all creative effort varies not as consciously perhaps but nonetheless as truly as do the religions the beliefs the customs and the arts of different peoples
648813 when i went back and read the stuff sapir wrote in the twenties i just realized hey this really is a tradition that we lost
648814 people believe theyve actually studied a language when they have given it a chomskyan formalism and you may have given us absolutely no insight whatsoever into that language as a separate language
648815 take a radical re xamination of my whole approach to the problem
648816 as i read more and i got into philosophy and met a lot of friends who werent christians it became difficult for me to sustain the belief structure in the supernatural
648817 and i began to feel that academics was a hollow and insignificant way to spend ones life
648818 after twenty years of living like a pirah id had it with roughing it
648819 this new beginning with the pirah really was quite liberating
648820 free from chomskyan constraints i was able to imagine new relationships between grammar and culture
648821 if there was some kind of appalachian inbreeding or retardation going on youd see it in hairlines facial features motor ability it bleeds over they dont show any of that
648822 when someone walks around a bend in the river the pirah say that the person has not simply gone away but
648823 they use the same phrase when a candle flame flickers
648824 the man who is wearing a top hat that is slightly crushed around the brim although still perfectly elegant is walking down the street that was recently resurfaced by a crew of construction workers who tended to take coffee breaks that were a little too long while eating a hot dog that was
648825 i saw the dog that was down by the river get bitten by a snake
648826 everett explained that because the pirah accept as real only that which they observe their speech consists only of direct assertions
648827 you open up one folder and that splits into two other things and that splits into two others thats a tree structure simon argues that this is essential to the way humans organize information and is found in all human intelligence systems if simon is correct there doesnt need to be any specific linguistic principle for this because its just general cognition
648828 the ability to put thoughts inside other thoughts is just the way humans are because were smarter than other species
648829 having made the pirah sound like the mindless bearers of an almost subhumanly simple culture
648830 i think from the point of view of i dont know human solidarity human rights and so on its really very important to know that its a question that many people dont dare to raise whether we have the same cognitive abilities or not we humans
648831 they can out survive anybody any other indian in this region
648832 ug is the true theory of the genetic component that underlies acquisition and use of language
648833 for the most part those works are about facts and the categorizing of facts
648834 we ask the questions that our theories tell us to ask
648835 i would find the opposite troubling i e that a researcher never changed their mind or found errors in their earlier work
648836 there are alternatives to universal grammar and the fact that npr
648837 talk about different things than we do different things get grammaticalized
648838 universal grammar was a good try and it really was not so implausible at the time it was proposed but since then we have learned a lot about many different languages and they simply do not fit one universal cookie cutter
648839 theres a lot of strange stuff going on in the chomskyan program hes a guru he makes pronouncements that his disciples accept on faith and that he doesnt feel compelled to defend in the conventional scientific manner some of them become accepted within his circle as gods truth without really being properly evaluated and surprisingly for someone who talks about universal grammar he hasnt actually done the spadework of seeing how it works in some weird little language that they speak in new guinea
648840 recursion had always been an important part of chomskys theory
648841 but in chomsky mark ii or mark iii or mark vii he all of a sudden said that the only thing unique to language is recursion its not just that its the universal that has to be there its the magic ingredient that makes language possible
648842 in my paper with ray we argue that if you just magically inject recursion into a chimpanzee youre not going to get a human who can put words together into phrases label concepts with words name things that happened decades ago or that may or may not happen decades in the future
648843 if you had something that was present in five thousand nine hundred and ninety nine of the languages and someone found one language that didnt have it well i think there may be some anthropologists who would say this shows that theres no universals that anything can happen
648844 but more likely youd say well whats going on with that weird language
648845 it is perfectly safe to attribute this development to natural selection
648846 so long as we realize that there is no substance to this assertion that it amounts to nothing more than a belief that there is some naturalistic explanation for these phenomena
648847 it acts as if in some inexplicable way almost mysteriously language is hermetically sealed from the conditions of life of the people who use it to communicate but this is not some kind of an abstract beautiful mathematical symbolic system that is not related to real life
648848 the plausible scenarios that we can imagine are ones that would suggest that early language looks something like the kind of thing that pirah looks like now
648849 i read it and all the stuff he said about evolution was almost more than hes ever said in any published thing and here it is in
648850 and he just made a few points that made me realize what hed been getting at in a more enigmatic fashion in some of his previous comments
648851 given his status in science chomsky is the least arrogant man the humblest great man ive ever met
648852 he has dug a hole for linguistics that it will take decades for the discipline to climb out of
648853 thats the only reason theyre here they have no interest in what were doing theyre hunter gatherers and they see us just like fruit trees to gather from
648854 my expectation coming in here is that theyre going to act just like my harvard undergrads
648855 theyre going to do exactly what every other human has done and theyre going to get this basic pattern the pirah are humans humans can do this
648856 maybe ask him to point to where he thinks the monkey is going to go

648863 oleh kerana peguam negara dan ketua polis negara sebagai individu telah ada laporan rasuah ke atas mereka untuk menentukan penyiasatan tidak dipandang serong peguam negara secara peribadi tidak mengendalikan kes ini
648864 orang nombor dua di dalam jabatan peguam negara adalah peguamcara negara jadi dialah yang akan mengendalikannya
648865 dia anwar bukannya mahu mencari penyelesaian dengan cara undang undang sebaliknya dia hanya mencari persepsi politik seolah olah dia adalah orang yang teraniaya sedangkan kita terlupa orang yang ada stigma dan menjadi mangsa dalam perkara kes ini
648866 adalah susah untuk polis dan jabatan peguam negara untuk menjawab kenyataan kenyataan tentang kes itu kerana ada butiran dan maklumat yang tidak boleh dikeluarkan

648879 saya hanya menyatakan kesediaan sahaja dan akhirnya keputusan tetap dibuat oleh pucuk pimpinan parti
648880 hanya saya tahu apa yang anwar tahu dan anwar tahu apa yang saya tahu saya masih lagi berpegang kepada prinsip untuk tidak mengaibkan orang

648889 there was a terrific boom and bits of wood and debris just flew forward into first class and the oxygen masks dropped down
648890 we were told that one of the rear doors a hole had blown into it but ive since looked at the plane and theres a gigantic gaping hole in the plane
648891 it was absolutely terrifying but i have to say everyone was very calm
648892 im looking at the plane now and just forward of the wing theres a gaping hole from the wing to the underbody
648893 its about two meters by four meters and theres baggage hanging out so you assume that theres a few bags that may have gone missing
648894 we heard a very large bang the oxygen masks came out but the crew was very calm and everything was fine
648895 the shock came when many got off the plane and saw the hole
648896 you see the hole and you realize we were very lucky
648897 some people were crying some people were pretty shaken when they saw the hole

649036 the news was sure to bolster government which has been urging iraqs sunni arab neighbors to forgive loans made during saddam husseins regime and restore diplomatic relations
649037 iraq has been appealing for relief of at least 67 billion in foreign debt owed mostly to arab nations that have been reluctant to forgive iraqs belligerence during saddam husseins regime
649038 we appreciate the emiratis recognition that a secure and prosperous iraq is in the interests of everyone in the region prime minister maliki and the government of iraq should also be applauded for their continued outreach to their neighbors and their efforts to advance a positive agenda through regional diplomacy
649039 sunni militant groups like al qaida in iraq mistrustful of the government have warned arab states not to open embassies in baghdad

649061 he is a very very good captain what sums him up is quite simple for me look at his performances against australia vaughan averages nearly 48 with four hundreds
649062 i dont see how people can question him he loves playing them even though its the toughest job in international cricket but its what he wants he wants to take those guys on

649069 today i have decided to stand down as england captain to be honest it is the hardest decision i have ever had to make but also the easiest
649070 i am giving away the job i have loved for five years put my heart and soul into the job but my mind has told me to pack it in
649071 i feel if i kept going as captain my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career i am going to carry on playing i believe there are a lot more runs in me i hope this decision will help that
649072 rainer schuettler claims that he should be allowed to compete in the games considering that he has been entered by the german noc national olympic committee and that he is eligible as a result of his position in the itf computer ranking due to the withdrawal of some players who were qualified for the olympic tournament
649073 he was with us last week at our national championships seeing us off and giving us words of wisdom
649074 mark lenzi the 1992 springboard gold medallist and 1996 bronze medallist has also been visiting our training centre and that type of thing
649075 they are really wanting us to win they want us to move forward
649076 they truly want to be involved greg has been a great support hes been to a lot of our training camps over the past three years and mark has most recently got involved because hes back into coaching
649077 both of them have just given us words of wisdom and words of advice and said heres what it is and go do it
649078 i think we have done a better job now of preparing our men than we have in the past years so i think were going to be able to step it up
649079 the chinese certainly are favoured they are on their home soil and theyve dominated the sport for the last couple of decades
649080 we are knocking on the door though and should the door open we are going to walk through
649081 i thought our defense was excellent and on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch
649082 what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and to me thats a really big thing
649083 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them
649084 the ball found me and i was able to make them pay in that kind of situation where the game is kind of see sawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron james it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
649085 hes put so many contingencies around it that i wonder in fact i question whether he would do it at all
649086 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met
649087 the fbi has picked up two boxes of files in connection with the detroit public schools retain and gain initiative
649088 since then i have had several discussions with the fbi related to retain and gain
649089 we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation
649090 the fbi needs to do their job and someone needs to go to jail
649091 based on the information that was shared with me before dr calloway got here and since shes been here it is not likely they are not going to find something

649094 le he estado abanicando un rato ah dentro que se encontraba mal
649095 i always had faith in my team its a great comeback and im specially happy because everyone contributed to the cause
649096 veeru sehwag and gautam gambhir gave us fantastic starts which was crucial later harbhajan and ishant bowled well to guide us to victory
649097 there are a few grey areas which we need to address we have to ensure that if put in those conditions we can come out on a better note
649098 its still on trial and i think it needs good look in both the captains would sit with the umpires match referee and officials at the end of the tour to discuss those issues
649099 it was a really good comeback by india it was a crucial match for them and they did well
649100 it 307 was a big score to chase we lost three early wickets and the middle order also failed to deliver but it was a close game
649101 with the new ball he did what our bowlers could not do he showed that it was possible to ask questions to the batsmen
649102 he is progressing nicely along side muralitharan and working very hard to improve he got 10 wickets in only his second test which is an amazing achievement
649103 the double century came at the right time we wanted a good start and put enough runs on the board and im happy to have done it
649104 i enjoy batting even more after scoring century and i enjoy batting longer
649105 besides if you have flopped in the previous innings you have to make up for that and thats what i did
649106 not really i love to play my shots it does not matter whether i score or not
649107 most importantly the captain and coach backed me they told me go out enjoy and give us a good start im happy i could do that
649108 our people are ready to come back to their homes and support the coalition and iraqi forces
649109 there is absolutely no question that our forces couldnt have done any of this without the help of the iraqi forces
649110 i have been sick for many days and they gave me medicine for free that will help me get better
649111 there were a lot of people who came and saw the ia working with local personnel i believe this is a step in the right direction for the iraqi people
649112 it is like a new house for the students now that we have a new looking school it will allow the students to work harder and better

649115 this school refurbishment is a testament to the level of care for the neighborhood
649116 my soldiers have taken the time to ensure work is done correctly and according to the scheduled scope of work
649117 with the help of both cf and the district council this place has become a school again
649118 on behalf of our neighborhood principal and teachers we give special thanks for giving us the security to make it happen
649119 through sports they are also building a loyalty base with the kids building pride and respect within the communities

649165 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
649166 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
649167 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
649168 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more

649236 sesungguhnya allah menyuruh kamu sekalian untuk menyampaikan amanah kepada yang berhak menerimanya dan menyuruh kamu apabila menetapkan hukum diantara manusia supaya kamu menetapkannya dengan adil
649237 namun secara lebih khusus pembicaraan ayat ini ditujukan kepada para pemimpin dan penguasa seperti yang dipahami oleh muhammad bin kaab dan zaid bin aslam yang dinukil oleh ibnu katsir
649238 bila persoalan diserahkan kepada orang yang tidak berkompeten maka tunggulah kehancurannya
649239 tiga hal yang harus ditunaikan baik kepada orang yang berbakti maupun kepada pelaku maksiat
649240 hai orang orang yang beriman taatlah kepada allah dan taatlah kepada rasul nya serta ulil amri diantara kamu kemudian jika kalian berbeda pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah dan kepada rasul as sunnah jika kalian benar benar orang yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat
649241 tidak ada agama bagi orang yang tidak bisa menunaikan amanah
649242 penunjukkan seseorang sebagai pemimpin merupakan salah satu tugas agama yang paling besar bahkan agama tidak akan tegak begitu juga dunia tidak akan baik tanpa keberadaan pemimpin kemaslahatan umat manusia tidak akan terwujud kecuali dengan menata kehidupan sosial karena sebagian mereka memerlukan sebagian yang lain dalam konteks ini kehidupan sosial tidak akan berjalan dengan baik dan teratur tanpa keberadaan seorang pemimpin
649243 dunia adalah ladang akhirat agama tidak akan sempurna kecuali dengan dunia kekuasaan dan agama adalah kembaran agama adalah tiang sedangkan penguasa adalah penjaganya bangunan tanpa tiang akan roboh dan apa yang tidak dijaga akan hilang keteraturan dan kedisiplinan tidak akan terwujud kecuali dengan keberadaan penguasa
649244 tidak dibenarkan tiga orang bepergian di tengah padang pasir yang tandus kecuali jika mereka mengangkat salah seorang diantara mereka sebagai amir pemimpin
649245 aku bersaksi tidak ada ilah selain allah dan aku bersaksi bahwa muhammad adalah rasul nya
649246 bagaimana kalau suatu pagi aku terbangun dan berubah pikiran mungkinkah aku akan merasa telah melakukan sebuah kesalahan besar
649247 aku hampir saja menggambarkan pengalaman batinku itu sebagai coming out keluar karena untuk pertama kali suatu bagian penting namun sangat rahasia dari diriku kini muncul dan diketahui orang lain
649248 ini sebuah titik penting dalam perjalanan hidupku karena aku saat itu juga sedang mempelajari konsep reliji yang mengajari orang tentang kasih sayang benakku penuh dengan pergulatan konsep ketuhanan aku terus mencari ke mana seharusnya aku melangkah secara spiritual
649249 sebenarnya sama sekali tidak ada niatku berpacaran dengan seorang muslim
649250 islam itu mengajari laki laki untuk merendahkan perempuan kalau tidak kenapa islam mengizinkan pria memiliki empat orang istri
649251 jujur saja semua perdebatan soal islam inilah yang membuat kami bertahan pacaran selama empat tahun dia selalu berusaha mencoba menjawab semua pertanyaanku dan memberiku rujukan dari al quran dan hadits aku mulai membacanya sendiri dan perlahan lahan semua pertanyaanku mulai terjawab sampai aku tersadar bahwa banyak sekali pandanganku yang keliru tentang islam karena sedikitnya pengetahuanku misalnya tentang bahwa laki laki boleh beristri empat aku keliru menyimpulkan
649252 salah satu hal yang juga kalau kusadari adalah bahwa dalam islam poligami bukannya didorong dan dipromosikan melainkan ditolerasi kadang kadang memang poligami menjadi kebutuhan tetapi selalu ada rambu rambu penjaganya kalau seorang pria menikah namun istrinya tak bisa memberinya anak maka ia boleh mengambil istri kedua dengan kesepakatan dari istri pertama di lain pihak bila seorang pria tidak bisa memberi anak maka si istri dapat meminta cerai bagiku ini cara yang lebih baik daripada yang terjadi di barat yang memungkinkan si suami menceraikan istri tanpa tunjangan apa pun
649253 doktrin tentang poligami ini sebenarnya adalah untuk melindungi wanita bukan untuk mendorong kaum pria mengumpulkan sekian istri untuk berbangga bangga inilah jenis pertanyaan yang aku lontarkan sendiri lalu aku perdebatkan sampai kehabisan jawaban sendiri misalnya mengapa perempuan membutuhkan perlindungan pria mengapa perempuan tak boleh memiliki lebih dari satu suami aku tersadar bahwa seorang perempuan tidak mungkin memiliki empat suami karena tentu akan sulit menentukan siapa ayah anak anaknya dan para ayah itu bisa saja lalu berkelahi soal siapa yang harus menunjang kehidupan anak anak tersebut
649254 aku sendiri merasa akan ada kendala teknis dari pendekatan ini secara pribadi tetapi aku sendiri sangat sangat ingin menikah dan aku yakin pada akhirnya aku akan mendapatkan seorang suami yang baik insya allah
649255 saat pertama kali hendak mengenakan jilbab aku sempat merasa cemas bertanya tanya dalam hati apa kiranya reaksi orang melihatku

649260 seandainya penduduk sebuah negeri beriman dan bertaqwa niscaya akan kami turunkan keberkahan dari langit dan bumi
649261 sesungguhnya kami telah memberi kekuasaan kepadanya dzul qarnain di muka bumi dan kami telah memberikan kepadanya jalan untuk mencapai segala sesuatu

649264 sesungguhnya bumi ini akan diwariskan kepada hamba hamba ku yang sholeh
649265 apabila telah datang pertolongan allah dan kemenangan dan kamu lihat manusia masuk agama allah dengan berbondong bondong maka bertasbihlah dengan memuji tuhanmu dan mohonlah ampun kepada nya sesungguhnya dia adalah maha penerima taubat
649266 engkau telah janji dan aku telah duduk menunggu tapi engkau tidak datang mengapa
649267 anjing di dalam rumahmu itu telah mencegahku sesungguhnya kami tidak masuk ke dalam rumah yang ada anjing dan gambar
649268 dihalalkan bagimu yang baik baik dan oleh binatang buas anjing yang telah kamu ajar dengan melatih nya untuk berburu kamu mengajarnya menurut apa yang telah diajarkan allah kepadamu maka makanlah dari apa yang ditangkapnya untukmu dan sebutlah nama allah atas binatang buas itu dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah amat cepat hisab nya qs al maidah 4 al mukallab adalah hewan buas apa saja termasuk di dalamnya anjing burung elang dan lainnya semuanya harus sudah terlatih menurut kepada perintah tuannya dan ketika melepasnya diucapkan basmalah di ayat lain juga disinggung tentang para hamba allah yang menghuni gua ashhabul kahfi di mana mereka memiliki seekor anjing yang mengikuti selama pelarian dan persembunyian atau kamu mengira bahwa orang orang yang mendiami gua dan raqim anjing itu mereka termasuk tanda tanda kekuasaan kami yang mengherankan qs al kahfi 9 meski ada beberapa perbedaan pendapat tentang makna raqim di dalam ayat ini namun tidak sedikit yang berpendapat bahwa raqim adalah nama anjing milik salah seorang dari mereka ayat ini menjunjukkan setidaknya umat islam di masa lalu sebelum masa kenabian muhammad saw dibolehkan memelihara anjing kenajisan anjing selain keharaman memelihara anjing di dalam rumah seorang muslim yang memelihara anjing untuk penjaga atau pemburu juga harus memperhatikan sisi lainnya yaitu faktor kenajisan air liur anjing dan tubuhnya juga ada beberapa hadits nabawi yang secara tegas menyebutkan bahwa air liur anjing hukumnya najis di antaranya hadits berikut ini dari abi hurairah ra bahwa rasulullah saw bersabda bila seekor anjing minum dari wadah milik kalian maka cucilah 7 kali hr bukhari 172 muslim 279 90 dari abi hurairah ra bahwa rasulullah saw bersabda sucinya wadah kalian yang dimasuki mulut anjing adalah dengan mencucinya 7 kali
649269 di rumah yang kedua ada anjing sedangkan di rumah yang pertama hanya ada kucing dan kucing itu itu tidak najis
649270 ini adalah bagian dari karunia allah untuk mengujiku apakah aku bersyukur atau kufur
649271 sesungguhnya harta kekayaan ini tidak lain kecuali dari hasil kehebatan ilmuku
649272 dan allah mengeluarkan kamu dari perut ibumu dalam keadaan tidak mengetahui sesuatupun dan dia memberi kamu pendengaran penglihatan dan hati agar kamu bersyukur
649273 hai orang orang mukmin jika kamu menolong agama allah niscaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
649274 hai manusia kamulah yang berkehendak kepada allah dan allah dialah yang maha kaya tidak memerlukan sesuatu lagi maha terpuji
649275 sesungguhnya harta kekayaan ini tidak lain kecuali dari hasil kehebatan ilmuku
649276 dahulu umat islam melihat bahwa di antara bentuk syukur nikmat yaitu mengucapkannya
649277 tidak bersyukur kepada allah orang yang tidak berterima kasih pada manusia
649278 sesuatu yang datang padamu dari allah berupa kenikmatan dan kemuliaan kenabian maka ceritakan dan dakwahkan kepada manusia

649293 students should be able to handle any problems where there is not a dramatic power difference

649298 they might say im worried im observing these symptoms in the past we were dismissive of parents we were almost on the edge of arrogance as a university that we knew how to raise adolescents and that intrusive uninformed parents were pushing to be involved in an area that should be the exclusive domain of the university parents have wisdom we dont have

649303 impatience is hardly a new phenomenon among employees in their 20s
649304 but hr departments are seeing unusually rapid turnover among gen ys or millennials and theyre not sure what to do about it
649305 and three quarters of hr executives seem to be aware of this and realize they have but a short window in which to capture the hearts and minds of such new hires
649306 gen ys are the most technology savvy generation and grew up with immediate access to whatever they needed such as information or connections they are able to identify new opportunities much more easily than any generation before them so they tend to be impatient when told they have to wait and pay their dues
649307 gen y parents taught them theyre special that they can do anything and as such should not settle for less than what they deserve at the same time their boomer and gen x parents experienced downsizing and taught them that loyalty to an organization is outdated that they need to look out for themselves first
649308 reassurance such as this can go a long way to improving the likelihood that your gen y employees will stay

649405 what the subtle interplay of these photographs and texts conveys is the surreality that is latent within the real the process of subjective revelation as well as inviting us to make our own explorations and to look at the world in an entirely different way there have been many books about surrealism published in this country but very few books that are in themselves surrealist this is the first in a very long time
649406 je ne veux pas grandir pas grandir pour ne pas mourir pour ne pas souffrir

649409 there are two and a half billion people in those countries and we have less than seven million in israel
649410 after america israel is one of the most important centers for new technology
649411 european countries are conservative societies and not the best places for innovation
649412 israelis think outside the box and have a high tolerance for risk
649413 thats why they are so good at coming up with new technologies and having so many companies on the nasdaq
649414 israel can win the difficult battle for survival only by developing painstakingly the intelligence and expert knowledge of her young people in technology
649415 it is ironic that those who like to refer to surrealisms legacy look anywhere but to surrealism itself for its continuity
649416 today surrealisms dynamic has many vectors throughout the world not only in the form of various organised groups and in their activities and projections into the public sphere but also in those individuals who prefer to adventure alone
649417 what distinguishes such practices that are termed surrealist is a question of intention and of intelligence propelled from within a social political and moral dimension it is thus moreover a sensibility a way of looking at and acting upon the world
649418 surrealism for me was home i was among friends at last having been away in a foreign land all my life the spell of it then cast remains a frisky imp haunting my life

649421 before you were lucky to be in one maybe two olympics as you had to go and earn a living
649422 but now athletes can make a living through marketing and endorsements so they can extend their careers
649423 i am excited about the expanded coverage we are offering to our clients with these new categories
649424 we are leading the way as one of the internets finest and most extensive coverage of the celebrity and entertainment world
649425 as far as were concerned nick is a lifer with this organization hes not going anywhere at all
649426 weve simply taken the position of founding director and split it in two so we will now have a chief curator and an executive director as the two most senior management positions nick is going to be the chief curator because its important that he be able to spend 100 percent of his attention in this area there is no one more qualified for this job than nick
649427 thanks to nicks tireless and dedicated leadership weve been successfully founded and now were ready to move on to the next phase its a function of our growth and our success that wherever possible we need to move away from people having to do multiple functions that cant be reasonably and effectively accomplished by one person which is so common in a start up operation to allow people to focus on their strengths and areas of expertise
649428 as we quietly grew to 25 full time employees the administration was getting sufficiently complex and time consuming i was also beginning to spend a lot of time on the road so the opportunity to focus on curatorial and programming affairs was a welcome relief and allows me to sail into my dotage doing what i truly love
649429 nick is still functioning as hes always functioned there is no vacancy so were going to hire the new person as soon as we can find the perfect candidate for the job

649431 its amazing to see just how far the internet has come just in the past ten years
649432 i guess youd have to be a true computer nerd to be doing this as long as i have when you told people ten years ago that you ran a website they seemed amazed as if you were doing something magical now today its commonplace
649433 in the mid to late 90s there were a lot of music fans out there like myself that picked up on the internet long before the music industry ever took it seriously now many of the labels out there are still trying to catch up and with cd sales on the decline and digital sales on the rise the industry knows that it has to stay on top of any new technology or trend if it wants to survive
649434 as far as my dolly site goes i consider myself very blessed because the work ive done over the years has been very well received by both fellow fans and dollys people ever since the site started ive been able to connect with hundreds of fans around the world many of which have helped contribute to the site
649435 it all started out of just loving dolly parton and her music and i think its the same for anybody who runs any kind of fan site
649436 theres never been a more exciting time to be a music fan especially if youre digitally inclined fan sites are a unique way for fans to not only pay tribute to their favorite artists but to actually help promote their work and possibly make some money at the same time i think anytime a fan can help increase the exposure of an artist its a good thing to look back and know that i was able to play an active role in promoting music that i love is really exciting

649468 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
649469 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
649470 the scientific community is really going to run with this
649471 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
649472 this is the nirvana weve been talking about for years

649506 but solutions need not only be the result of constant repetition there is another route not so structured but rather free floating and more experimental but no less obsessive it is to be found in the activity of play i cannot overemphasize the importance of play the freedom of play and its transitional character encourage the suspension of beliefs whereby a shift in direction is possible play ought to be part of the working process free from skepticism and self criticism play allows you to relinquish control playful activity provides an alternative way to see to imagine to do to make to think otherwise in play there are no ends there are only means however means inadvertently can lead to ends rules can be made up as you go along or even in hindsight

649547 i tried to get as many guys as i could to play summer ball this year
649548 but i think many kids like to have their summers off
649549 most kids nowadays arent interested in playing sports in the summer they are more interested in the beach camping and hanging out with friends
649550 the current state of the economy has high school athletes putting their athletics on hold and putting all their time into summer jobs

649568 what the data actually show is that the 2006 estimate of roughly 56 000 new infections is substantially higher its about 40 percent higher than what had previously been estimated

649593 ever since the first book came out its been steadily building in popularity im 50 and i read it and ive talked many women my age into reading it its very romantic though theres no sex in it at all i think this notion of a byronic hero who has to restrain himself to protect the woman he loves resonated with a lot of female fantasies
649594 stephenie meyers writing might not be spectacular but shes an amazing storyteller
649595 what i like about the world that she has created in twilight is that there are rules about what vampires can do and what they cant do and the rules dont change in the harry potter books sometimes she rowling will put the characters in a predicament and then invent some new magic that they can do to get them out of it
649596 stephenie meyer knows how to spin out the moral perplexity of growing into adulthood and making decisions youll have to face the rest of your life
649597 and she knows how to write a lot of adventure i was flipping pages wanting to find whatever happens next
649598 he saw what he did as a spontaneous gift to the city something that just happened like a dream i would never reconstruct any of that or let trickery intrude on that part of the film
649599 and that anything that happened in that part of the country could happen anywhere in the country
649600 to make it that much more of a social pressure cooker
649601 finding people who felt they needed to accomplish something if they feel that need in all likelihood their year will follow a dramatic arc

649603 he knew i wanted to get his ideas and use his energy and engagement to bring his story to life many people in new york first encounter the tale of this frenchman walking between the towers as one in the family of new york stunts but its really about an artistic performance made possible by a conspiracy i always saw this as a suspense film a thriller
649604 he transformed an environment and in 1974 that environment hadnt quite been finished
649605 their interviews were very emotional detailed and fresh this was a big event in their lives probably the most exciting moment they ever had
649606 every film is defined by a series of choices my goal was always to tell this story as fully as i can and give people some of the joy and thrills i had finding out about it a more conventional documentary might have commentary linking what philippe does to childhood traumas which is equally interpretive and possibly more phony than putting on a really good show

649610 the whole production team traveled in convoy overland for seventeen hours and arrived on site at 6 30 a
649611 the excessive hours we work does not help the production workers its all down to poor planning minci is not concerned about the overtime since they are not footing the bill we lose a lot of time shifting equipment etc hither and thither and getting people to distant place
649612 its a matter of administration and coordination they can not simply blame the workers
649613 everyone is working with the same enthusiasm the same commitment but there is growing malaise vtv workers believe it should not be like this and that the president chavez is misinformed or is being given information that is mis managed for a completely different purpose minci minister andres izarra was making the same statements two years ago that the president is now using to put the blame on us and it is all wrong

649619 lieutenant weve just lost contact with captain picards site again
649620 no doctor but at the moment were not expecting any
649621 because communications to his site are down at the moment
649622 weve been experiencing periodic failure of contact with the site but dont worry it comes back pretty quickly
649623 well lieutenant i want a full explanation what the hells been going on
649624 ever since captain picard went down to the surface weve been having short periods of failed communications it rarely lasts more that twenty minutes the first few times it happened we hailed the captain but he became a little annoyed by our what he referred to as over bearing attitude i spoke to him sir and he told me to ignore the breaks and to desist in contacting him he said he would call us when he was ready i informed commander riker of the captains wishes and he concurred sir
649625 very well keep me informed i want to know the instant you regain contact
649626 why the hell didnt you let me know about the communications blackouts weve been having with the captains site
649627 because theyre of short duration and the captain himself told us not to worry over them
649628 bloody hell will how long has it been since anybody spoke to him
649629 and youre not concerned i dont believe you will how the hell can you idly sit up there twiddling your damned thumbs when you dont know if your commanding officer is all right or not
649630 beverly i told will to stop worrying and leave the captain alone in my opinion the last thing captain picard needed was over officious people intruding on his very private time with his son and i still hold to that notion
649631 but its been over forty eight hours deanna and he hasnt contacted me either
649632 okay beverly as soon as we regain contact ill hail him and ill let you know
649633 well im due on duty in ten minutes so once ive got an up to date report ill assess the situation
649634 i will be on the bridge for the foreseeable future if im needed dont hesitate to call me
649635 may i see you in the ready room please commander
649636 hold on hold on to what will hold on to the thought that jean luc and tobias could be ill or hurt
649637 i know and thats the bloody trouble we dont know anything
649638 beverly calm down in all probability captain picard and tobias are fine you know how he is his privacy is tantamount to him
649639 yes of course i know but deanna he hasnt contacted me hes never failed to keep in contact with me whenever hes left the ship not in nine years now do you honestly think im panicking for no reason
649640 no well except when hes been on covert missions where contact was forbidden but thats not the case here is it
649641 okay you have a point but im still going to go with dee ill wait til midday then if we still cant contact him ill send someone down
649642 give them a chance beverly the captain and will knows what theyre doing
649643 i suppose but these next few hours are going to be hell
649644 remember papa we came in last night it was raining and there were birds then that
649645 well some of the rainwater may have found its way down the walls can you check
649646 can you put some more wood on the fire i want to see more
649647 we need to eat do you think you can phaser off a forelimb if not give me the phaser and ill have a go
649648 well done tobias now when the fire dies down a little i want you to throw the limb on the coals we need to burn off the fur and cook the meat as much as possible in the meantime i want you to drink some more then bring me more water please
649649 commander weve been tinkering with the sensors ive re routed some warp power and tweaked the couplings i think we may have a little more success now with your permission ill come up to oversee the scan
649650 i think it would be best to see how this pans out before we send anyone down to the surface a few more minutes wont make much difference either way
649651 we still cant punch all the way through but im getting some screwy readings here what do you have data
649652 inconclusive geordi can you augment the forward array eight more percent
649653 commander we are detecting a power source very large and seemingly connected to a network of conduits that extend throughout the target area and beyond there appears to be areas of concentration situated at various places exemplified by round ground level portals
649654 unknown however it is responsible for the cloak the output is in the terawatt range extremely powerful it appears to be cyclic the emanations are undulating suggesting a pulse generator
649655 how precisely can we pinpoint it would it be possible to take it out with a phaser strike
649656 i would advise against that commander we do not yet know the purpose of the generator or its relation to the planet as a whole
649657 but although we can detect the power source we still cant scan the rest of the surface i would like to remedy that if we can
649658 im with data commander until we know exactly what that generator is doing i advise caution we simply dont know enough yet
649659 all right i agree we should wait until we know more but i want that power source targeted and phasers ready to take it out if need be
649660 good now mr data i want you lieutenant mrak and a security detail to take a shuttle and go to the captains campsite once there i want you to verify the captain and his son are in good health then i want you to ask captain picard to contact doctor crusher post haste
649661 aye sir and commander one of the portal areas appears to be close to the captains site may i have permission to investigate it sir

649748 weve done extensive research on the hotel market in erie county and concluded the downtown waterfront has meaningful unmet need for quality hotel rooms

649750 just look at the success of the hampton inn on delaware avenue downtown
