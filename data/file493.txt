4930040 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem

4930086 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4930087 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees

4930106 i went to israel on a skateboard trip four years ago and i met arthur rashkovan an israeli pro skater who started the group surfing 4 peace
4930107 at that time he brought 10 surfboards into gaza and has now decided to up the ante and bring in 22 more as a peace offering between the two surfing communities
4930108 we werent humanitarian workers or journalists we were just young guys with a camera
4930109 but we were very lucky and we ended up meeting with a retired general in the israel army who got us military visas
4930110 edward chase the director of photography and i got a ride down to the border from rashkovan
4930111 as we approached the border rashkovan said i want you to take down these numbers before you go
4930112 the main problem was that the israel navy was concerned that the surfboards constitute as a security threat
4930113 but we were saying that you want these young males participating in recreation as opposed to picking up rifles
4930114 this police officer approached us and then did this whistle thing and all the hamas officers with machine guns started crowding around and pointing to our cameras
4930115 i think he understood english and was just seeing what we would say
4930116 admittedly our purpose of making a documentary about surfers did sound ridiculous and after five minutes he realized that we were far too dumb to be any intelligence agents
4930117 the officer got a huge smile on his face and said welcome to gaza have you had a nice day
4930118 youre going to have to see the film its interesting how things played out
4930119 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
4930120 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable

4930132 ive been coming down here since the 60s two or three times a week
4930133 if all these people were here every night there would never have been a problem but on a normal thursday down here you might get no more than 200 in
4930134 to be honest id say greyhound racing is dying everywhere
4930135 i used to work with a trainer in sydney and when i went back to australia recently there was only a tiny crowd there too its very sad
4930136 its a real shame to see it go as it means so much to the area
4930137 even though i havent lived in the east end for many years i have great memories of walthamstow and i know many people will miss it including me
4930138 he was a quiet lad i used to lock him in the lift for a laugh

4930145 home buyers were thin on the ground in canberra over the weekend with all 21 properties on offer at local auctions reportedly being passed in
4930146 i herniated a disc in my back three years ago and havent been the same since
4930147 as if that werent bad enough i also suffer from sleep apnea
4930148 he asked me what kind of pillow i was sleeping on i told him i wasnt sure what brand it was but it was soft and comfortable he told me to throw it away and start sleeping on a tri core cervical orthopedic pillow instead i did and have had tremendous results
4930149 the design also helps relieve spasms and alleviates minor tension since it re establishes the natural cervical curve of the neck while the person is at rest
4930150 even better than that it seems to have cured my sleep apnea as well
4930151 i cant tell you how good it feels to get a good nights sleep ive never felt better in my life
4930152 you spend about a third of your life in bed so i tell my patients to make sure their slumber is comfortable
4930153 i think hes a little more selective than in the past
4930154 hes hitting a lot of balls to right center and when he hits the ball to right center and gets base hits the other way hes a much better hitter
4930155 im seeing the ball good theres no doubt about that
4930156 i think its just one of those things ive always felt if i get my at bats the numbers will be there in the end
4930157 i think it has helped a little bit to have him up in the lineup
4930158 the real key with ty is just going the other way he has a tendency of pulling everything when tys in trouble its because hes in what i call pull mode when hes driving the ball to center and right center ty does pretty well
4930159 i like a little more space im getting a little older you see i dont need all this anxiety that ive had from time to time
4930160 if he hadnt had been able to go if hed have just gone two innings wed have been up a creek
4930161 i tip my cap to him because thats twice in a week hes had to do that its cost him
4930162 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
4930163 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
4930164 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
4930165 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
4930166 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
4930167 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
4930168 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
4930169 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4930170 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
4930171 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
4930172 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
4930173 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4930174 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4930175 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4930176 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4930177 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4930178 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4930179 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4930180 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4930181 corporate identity and csr will play an important role in differentiating a company in the future this will make a big difference in new markets such as russia and other eastern european markets
4930182 i just wanted to play and get it over with i think it was a positive anxiety a positive nervousness it worked out better than i thought not that i thought it would go badly it was like starting all over again thats not a bad thing i had a lot of fun it went well
4930183 it was a little awkward but for the most part i felt comfortable i had numerous people on the redskins say it didnt look right but its going to start looking right
4930184 i knew i was out there for the right reason im not going to say i havent second guessed my decision but when i stepped on the field i knew i made the right decision ive said it before im here for one reason and thats to help these guys win
4930185 i talked to eric mangini and he said he would think about it after about a second he told me he thought about it and i was done it was good to go out that way this was one of those things where everything seemed to be clicking
4930186 i mean catching a touchdown pass from a living legend a guy thats definitely a hall of famer its overwhelming to be honest
4930187 i think we did a pretty good job for the most part
4930188 i think we did a great job of trying to make plays and focus
4930189 i felt like i threw the ball well my arm feels great i moved around okay but id be lying if i said i felt perfect
4930190 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
4930191 that is going to be critically important because right now there is really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other
4930192 the information that has been put out there is really very little scientific information in there
4930193 the case is built from a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence and for a case this important its troubling to have so many loose ends the briefing pointed out even more loose ends than i thought there were before
4930194 its very hard to get the sense of whether this was scientifically good or bad we didnt really get the question settled other than taking their word for it
4930195 when you order a happy meal it needs to be there when you pull up to the payment window
4930196 so were used to taking a transaction and cranking it and presenting it to somebody to do something with
4930197 our focus here is on collaboration and its real time its real time collaboration with people you trust with a group weve kind of brought it all together thats the value we bring here
4930198 this is part of the reason for the huge explosion in self publishing made possible when technology and print on demand publishers gave writers the keys to the factory
4930199 you can publish pretty much anything you can think of
4930200 i think weve just scratched the surface weve got a hundred million ideas of things we want to do
4930201 the revolution in publishing is self publishing an author a creator of any kind can now take their fate in their own hands
4930202 most should self publish to make more money to get to press sooner to keep control of their work
4930203 you get more credibility for a printed book than for an e book

4930206 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
4930207 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
4930208 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
4930209 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
4930210 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
4930211 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
4930212 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
4930213 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
4930214 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
4930215 what im afraid of is that many of those who deserve to receive benefits but dont speak english will find themselves being dragged through a process that they dont understand
4930216 you can be sure though that the employers and the insurance company will have their attorneys on hand
4930217 what were we going to do try to modify the language
4930218 were we going to say that a person who cant return to work because theyre in jail or committed crimes isnt eligible for continuing benefits but if theyre in this country illegally theyre exempt
4930219 that would be like saying because youre in this country illegally and cant work here weve decided to retire you with full benefits
4930220 this law was designed to address worker compensation benefit issues there are other laws in place that address those employers who hire workers who are in this country illegally
4930221 we have the capacity the elements the talent and the equipment to do things right for the spanish speaking community

4930229 does blizzard want dispellers to be able to you know actually use their dispels in arena
4930230 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4930231 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4930232 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4930233 i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
4930234 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4930235 nobody by the name of sajid has been detained by us in connection with the serial blasts

4930237 when i called up the number i didnt get clear answers

4930252 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4930253 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4930254 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4930255 well look at the report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4930256 the implications for the budget long term are serious were doing it in a responsible way and we dont make any apologies for that either
4930257 i think it is important that we have an adequate pension system because decisions in this area do cost an enormous amount of money
4930258 and whatever we do has to be affordable but also in the long run it has to be sustainable
4930259 this government has had eight months already to do something about pensions
4930260 they could have funded a 30 a week increase to the single pension in this years budget by foregoing tax cuts for people earning more than 75 000 a year
4930261 our position over the long term is for a 100 a week increase to provide pensioners with a decent quality of life
4930262 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4930263 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4930264 we are hopeful of providing private fishers family with some long awaited answers
4930265 vietnam veterans say that it is really important that we dont have the same sort of mistakes that were made with us with this newer generation
4930266 one of the things that we are dealing with now is people who have come back from two or three different conflicts
4930267 that produces a whole range of questions about multiple deployments and what sorts of impacts they actually have on the people we send over
4930268 over the coming five to 10 years a lot more will have problems
4930269 we have to try to create a situation where when theyve got problems they get in touch and they get help quickly
4930270 no other issue is likely to dominate the political scene
4930271 putting bilateral relations at a normal footing at israels expense
4930272 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work
4930273 the negotiating track is open there are contacts between the parties
4930274 according to foreign media israel is active inside iranian territory
4930275 some of the 40 000 rockets of syrian and iranian manufacture can hit israeli targets as far south as beersheba 350 kilometres away from hezbollah launching pads north of lebanons litani river not only has tel aviv come within range but hizbollah and the palestinian hamas in gaza with their ideological weltanschauung view of the world can between them cover most of israel except for its southern most tip at eilat on the red sea using these two surrogates tehran can therefore make war on israel and keep its hands clean
4930276 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran a constant flow of information bears witness to the fact that the israeli government is seriously considering attacking iran in order to disrupt its nuclear plans we do not disregard irresponsible actions by the iranian government we also oppose atomic weapons in principle and support the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the region however it is clear that the main source of the immediate danger of a new widespread war stems from the policies of the israeli government and the flow of threats from it backed by provocative military manoeuvres after serious consideration we reiterate our position that all the arguments for such an attack are without any security political or moral justification israel might get caught up in an act of adventurism that could endanger our very existence and this without any serious effort to exhaust the political and diplomatic alternatives to armed conflict we are not certain that such an attack will occur but the very fact that it is being weighed as a reasonable option makes it imperative that we warn and caution against the destructive results of an offensive strike against iran

4930332 on the monday i went into the open air with my colleague jenny smith and when they saw us two little things stand there hundreds of colliers coal miners came round us at once after we had held our meeting we walked off to our hall the colliers came after us and god touched their hearts we have had nearly 700 decisions for christ since we went there we have got 140 members and they can all preach better than i can
4930333 i would not stop a woman preaching on any account i would not encourage one to begin i would not stay you if i had the power to do so although i should not like it i am for the worlds salvation i will quarrel with no means that promises help
4930334 if she have the necessary gifts and feels herself called by the spirit to preach there is not a single word in the whole book of god to restrain her but many very many to urge and encourage her
4930335 we would ask how it happens that so many of the most devoted handmaidens of the lord have felt constrained by the holy ghost to exercise it the word and the spirit cannot contradict each other
4930336 i cannot give time to preparation unless i can afford to put my sewing out
4930337 it never seems to occur to anybody that i cannot do two things at once
4930338 she reminded me again and again of counsel pleading with judge and jury for the life of the prisoner the fixed attention of the court the mastery of facts the absolute self forgetfulness of the advocate the ebb and flow of feeling the hush during the vital passages all were there

4930340 while the regular feminist organizations were attending to the politicians the salvation army was carrying through an object lesson that was much more easy to understand the hallelujah lasses were not consciously preaching feminism but as they went about their business they taught the other lesson too in that quiet and practical way which best carries conviction
4930341 women shall have the right to an equal share with men in the work of publishing salvation
4930342 a woman may hold any position of power and authority within the army
4930343 a woman is not to be kept back from any position of power or influence on account of her sex
4930344 women must be treated as equal with men in all intellectual and social relationships of life

4930352 theology is a wonderful science so long as we dont make a god of it because we do not know god through theology even though the meaning of the word theo logy is the knowledge of god no the only way that we know god is on our knees our mind completely empty and put into our heart our mouth closed when we are like that a mystery can slowly slowly unfold this requires silence solitude and so many other things that our lady can teach us

4930354 when i ran for office i made a promise to district residents that i would open a vocational school

4930356 attracting top talent has always been a priority of this administration and this is another step in the right direction
4930357 recruiting and retaining high quality energetic principals is a key component of reform
4930358 at the end of the day strong leadership is imperative at the school level parents teachers and students are counting on the district to deliver a top notch education to our kids and quality principals are essential

4930364 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4930365 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4930366 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4930367 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4930368 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4930369 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4930370 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4930371 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
4930372 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
4930373 but im always glad when they have time for a chat

4930384 the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate it
4930385 because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which i commanded you you must not eat of it
4930386 the man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever

4930465 russian president dmitry medvedev has said we are to withdraw
4930466 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4930467 if i was to demand they write tickets that would be a quota
4930468 thats not what this is now officers may have a perception its a quota my perception is youre being lazy and not doing your job
4930469 its something that i think if we were in a different part of the season or the standings he would pitch through it riggleman said
4930470 i am only here to fill you up a distraction from the small dishes that are to come and i will taste a bit like cardboard with wheat flavoring

4930473 our findings support a role for nmdar dependent modulation of da neurons in cue induced relapse to drug seeking
4930474 our findings link nmdar signaling in da neurons with relapse behavior and provide a new rationale in the treatment of cocaine addiction specifically the selective activation of the glur1 subunit could potentially improve the outcome of any given exposure therapy
4930475 the man ran from police and during the foot pursuit one of the officers fell and sustained a sprained ankle

4930477 we are very confident about the way we are playing
4930478 we are developing a group of young players and the senior guys are doing a great job
4930479 we just need to to work hard and make sure that we do things right
4930480 the one day game is a different ball game altogether and the indians pose a very different challenge
4930481 we just have to make sure that we get our game plan right
4930482 i was happy to be part of the asia cup squad it was a pleasant experience to win the tournament
4930483 the knock in colombo has given me a lot of confidence and i hope i can continue this form
4930484 but i had also prepared well before coming here and am aware that the conditions in dambulla are quite different from those in colombo
4930485 its important we play according to the conditions and not to peoples expectations
4930486 its very difficult to replace him not only on the field but of it as well
4930487 hes always digging deep into his experience and advising us so its going to be a big loss

4930491 were very short of time now if were going to relocate now it needs to be made within the next few days
4930492 operationally it would be difficult but its certainly not an option that would be discarded at this point and it could be relocated
4930493 they cricket australia need to give us a firm indication
4930494 all theyve done today is listen to the facts obviously weve heard that there are still some concerns particularly from the players association mainly to do with the confidence in the actual implementation of the security measures which are in place
4930495 its 24 days now till the tournament starts so its coming down to crunch time
4930496 what weve always said is that we reserve our rights to make a decision at the appropriate time even if we decide that were going we still reserve our rights to change our mind at any stage
4930497 taking on board the advice weve received today but also our ongoing assessments from various other sources weve got some thinking to do in the next little while things will obviously develop in the coming couple of weeks
4930498 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4930499 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4930500 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4930501 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4930502 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4930503 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4930504 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
4930505 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you

4930510 then we saw someone else selling them at 10 pair for 50 yuan oh well
4930511 i knew they wouldnt shut this place up its too much of a money spinner
4930512 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4930513 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4930514 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4930515 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4930516 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4930517 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4930518 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4930519 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4930520 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4930521 i remember thinking you looked ber young but i nearly died when you told me your age i thought for sure you had to be in your thirties at least then you read something you wrote and i thought shes the real deal not just some schmoe giving writing a whirl
4930522 the fights go on as long as they have to
4930523 why must they go to europe to study how to manage cities
4930524 why cant they go to singapore hong kong or taipei to learn
4930525 the ministry picked these two cities because both have an excellent local governance system and a perfect place to learn
4930526 the ministry feels you cannot run a city the old way and in order to become a world class city one must incorporate new ideas and ways and thats what this study tour is all about

4930547 el caso de venezuela es muy interesante porque quienes gobiernan fueron escogidos por los propios venezolanos los pueblos a veces se equivocan y lo pagan car simo eso deber a servir de escarmiento para no recaer en el error a m me espanta ver ejemplos tan flagrantes de lo que significa el autoritarismo y que a n haya sectores que creen que es el camino del desarrollo el mejor sistema que puede tener un pa s con todas sus imperfecciones es la democracia
4930548 por primera vez hay una izquierda que se juega la carta de la democracia eso ha fortalecido el sistema como ha ocurrido en chile y brasil el caso de venezuela es distinto porque el gobierno venezolano no cree en la democracia como tal sino en una democracia autoritaria que restringe libertades y que sigue una pol tica econ mica que ha fracasado en todo el mundo no existe un solo caso en el que una pol tica centralista intervencionista y estatizadora haya tra do beneficios por eso cay la uni n sovi tica por eso china dio un vuelco tan incre ble y por eso es que cuba es un pa s mis rrimo aqu tampoco va a triunfar con un m nimo de lucidez cualquiera se da cuenta que esa pol tica conduce al fracaso al empobrecimiento y a la corrupci n

4930565 the problem is that lowering gasoline prices at the pump would encourage more consumption so in the long run it would push prices up gasoline taxes in europe for example can account for up to 70 percent of fuel prices of course europeans pay much higher gasoline prices but the high tax levels have shielded drivers there from the wild price swings that american motorists have experienced in recent years

4930597 summer pursuits in the good ol days or more recently
4930598 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4930599 i feel like i have been run over by a truck really a bit second hand you could say
4930600 i believe i went down on someone elses oil that was on the track so it was nothing to do with the wet conditions one of the riders blew up at that point on the circuit earlier in the race
4930601 as soon as i touched the brakes i was down and there was nothing i could do when i initially went down i was travelling at 150mph so to come away without a broken leg is amazing
4930602 to be honest i am not too disappointed as i have extended my championship lead it was the first time this season that i thought about the championship once cal crutchlow went out of the first race i didnt risk things and settled for second place
4930603 i have had my fair share of good luck this year by winning races and passing backmarkers at just the right time so perhaps it is my time to have a bit of bad luck
4930604 there is no news on my future yet i have got to wait and see what airwaves ducati are planning to do for next season once that is sorted then i will decide over my options and which championship i will be competing in

4930609 therefore nothing in the wto would require epas to cover trade in services and trade related disciplines on investment competition government procurement or intellectual property
4930610 but here a word of caution for acp if as it looks likely at present the majority of ldcs least developed countries accept wto plus provisions in the epas in areas such as services competition and investment policies it will be very hard to sustain resistance to such measures at the wto
4930611 it would be the same as if in 1946 the german government said lets put up a statue to the victims of the holocaust and said lets be done with that
4930612 setting up these little gardens for people to stroll around and feel nice is one of these feel good california style exercises
4930613 and i dont see a practical benefit for something like that
4930614 look 99 percent of survivors might think this is stupid and meaningless
4930615 but there might be a few people who say this is everything to me and then for them it would be worthwhile
4930616 its easy for church officials to make symbolic gestures like this in part without being cynical because its good p r
4930617 but prayers and memorials are not a substitute for real concrete change
4930618 so its important psychologically for some to get any kind of validation
4930619 so we wanted something that wouldnt make people go inside
4930620 i figured if they could spend that much money on the cathedral
4930621 its smooth on top but below its very rough which is like a lot of survivors
4930622 and its a man made break its trying to come together but it cant ever heal completely
4930623 i think the important part about it is that it exists
4930624 its a physical statement and its going to be really hard to pull this up and pretend it wasnt there
4930625 i didnt have room on my give a damn plate for that
4930626 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
4930627 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
4930628 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4930629 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4930630 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4930631 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4930632 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4930633 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4930634 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4930635 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
4930636 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
4930637 but im always glad when they have time for a chat

4930651 while exports in terms of carats grew marginally in the first half of 2008 the price of diamond rose by 10 and helped push the overall trade to high levels we have also been witnessing a sharp increase in rough diamond inventories held in dubai which underlines dubais status as a major distribution conduit for leading manufacturing markets to further such initiatives dde plans to hold rough diamond sales weeks every month starting from august 24 2008 diamonds traded via the dde during the proposed sales weeks will include production from various mines across the world

4930668 i was at the mobil station to get gas when the phone rang and it was rich
4930669 i was caught way off guard shocked obviously was my initial reaction
4930670 over the course of yesterday rich and marian fielded a lot of offers that were substantial in relation to what we could offer i got a call this morning from rich telling me that marian was very very interested in being a red wing
4930671 i wanted the best chance to win the stanley cup and i feel like detroit is the team
4930672 i know i could get more money somewhere else but the thing that i was looking for for myself was to win the stanley cup

4930677 like a bird leaving its nest first batch of female military pilots to serve in the emirati armed forces
4930678 its a very special feeling no one feels it except those who fly a plane when you do your first solo its like a bird leaving its nest for the first time an unforgettable day
4930679 you dont believe its happening its great to know that your country has that confidence in you
4930680 its a different experience a different feeling to be in the cockpit and have full control of every single movement of the plane
4930681 you feel this is not a game its real life
4930682 ever since i finished high school i wanted to learn flying because it was something that i liked in the first place
4930683 flying is a fascinating thing in general anybody would be fascinated
4930684 i might have been a little hesitant but my family encouraged me especially with it being the first such thing in the emirates
4930685 they said dont let slip this opportunity its once in a lifetime
4930686 a womans passion about something will lead her to achieving what she aspires and thats why she should pursue her interests
4930687 you are supposed to be ready 24 hours of each day discipline is much stricter yet it gives you a lot of joy because you serve your country
4930688 the emblem on my shoulder is not a little thing its a great responsibility
4930689 being a pilot is a lifestyle not a profession you are ready to sacrifice your life at any moment for your country
4930690 i feel proud especially that i am part of the first batch and that encourages me to continue in this field
4930691 as a pilot you have to study all the time even after graduation you have to continue training because the more hours you fly the more experience you accumulate
4930692 its a great role whether we are men or women
4930693 go to your limit one day youll do something for your country dont limit yourself to whats available now and you will be the first in the world

4930695 dedc is working to expand trade opportunities with many markets including south africa which presents significant export opportunities for dubai based businesses
4930696 dubai is attracting worldwide attention through its innovative business practices and as a result is emerging as a global business hub with a reputation for a dynamic and diverse economy dubais non oil exports grew by 48 per cent from 2006 to 2007 and our re exports also grew by 28 per cent in the same period
4930697 south africa is seen as the gateway into africa and dubai is seen as the trading hub of the gcc it is a natural progression that we should be talking to each other to push forward further exports from our respective countries
4930698 south africas collaboration with edc has the potential to further streamline and enhance trade relations between south africa and the uae with south africa hosting the 2010 fifa soccer world cup there are unlimited opportunities to be explored by uae companies

4930705 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4930706 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4930707 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4930708 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4930709 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4930710 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
4930711 ive heard the same thing that the conventional wisdom establishing a correlation between obstetrician medical care during pregnancy and cerebral palsy in children is
4930712 things have obviously changed again around the club since the new boss took charge
4930713 it is not massively different but there are little things that have changed especially around the training ground
4930714 bowflex revolution xp workouts working out on the revolution is different than using free weights this is because it uses spiraflex technology a patented resistance technology that duplicates the benefits of free weights it works by creating smooth tensions through elastics wrapped around a coil this facilitates better targeting of muscle groups which lead to faster results as someone who still works out a gym i would much rather perform weight training exercises with perfect form than cheating to move the heaviest set due to the controlled nature of the cables cheating and bad form are not really possible on the xp you cant swing your body and uses momentum to drive the weights this is what ultimately leads to a better workout the feel of the revolution is very similar to a cable machine you would use at a gym
4930715 unlike free weights the revolution xp offers total control of your body form and range of motion doing a curl with dumbbells is a lot different than on a home gym with the former its very easy to swing your shoulders and cheat with the revolution xp there is no momentum due to its design and you are forced to use the right form good form helps alot in building quality muscle
4930716 it was a pretty big factor i really enjoy playing with him
4930717 we seem to have a pretty good chemistry thats not always easy to find so that was pretty important to get a chance to continue that im excited to get going next year
4930718 yeah whatever and however i do to not take the medicine they still feed me anyway so id better save my energy
4930719 i made a mistake and it cost us the game
4930720 mom has made all of the decisions about how to set up the store and what to sell
4930721 well be having after hours parties belly dance classes some art exhibits and other community events i love being part of the downtown and meeting people
4930722 ben haim has been with us only a few weeks but he has fitted in superbly
4930723 he has a point to prove after what must have been a very frustrating year for him at chelsea
4930724 but he has channelled all that into training and his performances so far he is very versatile and is a good tackler
4930725 i felt we needed to be a bit more vocal at the back and tal has already shown that he likes everyone around him to know what he thinks they should be doing
4930726 it is never easy for a new player to come into a new team especially if the team does not play well
4930727 i was pleased with the way dossena and keane worked against standard liege but i know that they will both play better
4930728 they are both players with quality and they are both internationals so i am sure that they will improve
4930729 its not a bottomless pit we cant expect the owner to keep funding it but its hard when you have to sell top players
4930730 thats the way the game is and its a fact that chelsea look an even stronger side now for scolari hes inherited a team of world class players and a few more have been added like deco and jose bosingwa who will both be big stars in england
4930731 a team like that can rip you to pieces if you are not careful and we have to find a way to stop them
4930732 last season we played chelsea in my first game for portsmouth and i thought we were the better side of course it will be hard now they are going to be buzzing with a new manager but we are buzzing too
4930733 its not an easy place to go to but we can take a lot of good things from the community shield last week
4930734 if we can go there and work hard like we did against manchester united then i think we can get a result
4930735 we can improve attacking wise from last week but we defended really well then and need to do that again
4930736 its a good move for clayton and this gives him a step on the ladder of league football and a taster of what its like
4930737 i think everton can fulfill my ambitions because they are one of the major clubs in this country
4930738 everton are a good club in a good position and the way they have done their business is really good
4930739 ronaldo is missing and possibly rooney nani is suspended and andersen is away at the olympics too
4930740 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the finish line
4930741 the fans are very passionate for the club and the players and i like that
4930742 i liked fan day and was surprised how many people were there taking their holidays to see us i think it is good because the chelsea fans are so enthusiastic for the team and the coach and new players it is good for us and we have to do our best in the games for them
4930743 yeah i am excited because it will be a good experience
4930744 we have had many training sessions and pre season games which have been very good
4930745 i had a little problem last week but now i am okay i want to start well at chelsea and make sure we win

4930785 well in that respect we first of all have to decide what the new electoral arrangements will be
4930786 i believe that best way to deal with that would be to engage in political dialogue and have consensus
4930787 we will then have to put through the reforms in a manner that is acceptable to the local and international communities
4930788 at the moment everything on this is on hold because the electoral commission cannot complete its work until it knows what it has to do and which basis it has to determine electoral boundaries

4930837 anda membangun sebuah repertoir ketika matang secara seksual tetapi jangan pernah berasumsi bahwa apa yang cocok dengan kekasih anda yang lama akan pas untuk orang yang baru
4930838 ada wanita yang bisa dengan mudah tertarik dengan seks namun ada pula yang sulit
4930839 jika satu satunya cara bagi seorang wanita untuk mencapai adalah dengan vibrator bukan berarti dia payah
4930840 sambil anda melakukan satu atau dua hal vibrator bisa melakukan hal yang lainnya

4930874 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4930875 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4931031 it was one of those things it was so sudden and unexpected that you had no choice but to lean on each other
4931032 you never think its going to happen to you until it actually does
4931033 it was tough i had to go to training camp a couple of weeks after it happened i was a mess we talked all the time we just kind of talked about everything else but that
4931034 we talk about life and all that kind of stuff but if i need some advice from another guy thats been through a lot in the nfl hell help me hell just tell me some of his experiences and what to look for it really does help a lot
4931035 hes definitely an established player who is one of the top middle linebackers in the league and im just a guy fighting right now to make a team the opportunities are different but were really both just happy to get our chances and make the most of it
4931036 he went to a team thats well coached and has a lot of veteran guys that he can learn from

4931041 hes a lively energetic guy hes a cool coach he knows his stuff
4931042 hes hard nosed when its time to get down to business camp this year wasnt too gruesome but at the same time we got a lot of things done

4931076 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4931077 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4931078 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4931079 programming the 80386 which was what i used when i started with linux
4931080 while not being recession proof football is to a certain extent recession resistant
4931081 football is a special thing it gets people through the working week and fans will give up a lot of things before they let go of their season tickets
4931082 theres a waiting list but when i tried to get on it i was told the list is closed because theyve just got too many applicants
4931083 english football fans are among the most loyal sets of consumers in the world our clubs know this and in their greed theyll exploit it but they arent thinking about the long term future good of the game its a mistake to just look at the numbers of season tickets being sold and think everythings healthy for instance i think that while people may not give up season tickets they will economise by not going to cup games
4931084 season ticket holders today are very different from those of 15 or even 10 years ago their age and affluence is going up the average age of a premier league season ticket holder is now 44 and a recent survey showed that only around 9 can be classified as working class that figure used to be around 75 80 and the average age was much younger season ticket prices have gone up by an average of 7 2 this summer but its a completely short term strategy a whole generation is being priced out of premier league football a lot of young people are growing up without ever having experienced live games
4931085 the atmosphere is declining if not dying at many matches its not as vibrant as it used to be and that is not what the television companies who fund our clubs want
4931086 by doing this newcastle are acknowledging the game has a problem
4931087 the noisy corner would have been totally unnecessary a few years ago
4931088 i think this is going to be a difficult year economically for a lot of clubs not because they are run badly but because the national economy is not in good shape
4931089 i have been a member of parliament for 26 years and i understand the pressures on the budgets of ordinary people up and down the country
4931090 peoples disposable income what theyve got to spend on other things once they deal with these fundamentals is likely to decrease this year
4931091 clearly football fanatics will continue spending their money on football
4931092 football clubs are an essential part of their communities and communities are hurting the bank of england was telling us just this week that communities are likely to continue to hurt for some time football cannot be totally protected from that economic squeeze
4931093 my advice to our own clubs is that you should review your budgets make sure they are as tight as possible and make sure you administer them as tightly as possible
4931094 across the country we are getting the same message the credit crunch is hitting football and the effect is likely to be even greater next year
4931095 i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
4931096 we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60 million on players on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially
4931097 the optimism reported by clubs who expect their sponsorship to grow next season is likely to be short lived
4931098 the current arrangements are based on existing three or five year sponsorship deals that have some years to run and once they are complete it is doubtful that new deals will be easy to secure
4931099 the pressurised climate is here for some time to come so it is imperative for the long term stability of the industry that clubs tackle their money concerns with a matter of urgency
4931100 while all clubs are starting to feel the bite of the credit crunch on their sales of tickets merchandising and corporate hospitality the premier league financial directors are reporting a more widespread set of financial challenges and pressures than in previous years
4931101 fans are experiencing the current economic realities just like everyone else
4931102 i would expect that there would be a particular impact with fans travelling to away games and the sale of replica shirts football often thinks it is divorced from the realities of the world and the complacency in some areas has been quite staggering
4931103 i dont think that last year we would have seen the gareth barry deal collapse over what seems to be 1 million or manchester united taking so long over berbatov the anticipated spending boom hasnt materialised deals are collapsing over what seem to be relatively trivial sums
4931104 the number of uk billionaires is a fairly small number and many of those have indicated they do not want to get involved in football
4931105 quite simply the financial requirement is for billionaires not millionaires
4931106 under pressure is it time for the industry to go on the defensive the annual survey of football club finance directors 2008

4931118 the man ran from police and during the foot pursuit one of the officers fell and sustained a sprained ankle
4931119 the other officer arrested the man who was taken to surry hills police station
4931120 i live life in the fast lane thats the truth
4931121 i think i live every day like its my last almost try to get the most out of it thats my mentality thats why when im behind in matches im not scared at that point
4931122 i was way too short to play so i used to have a beer crate about a foot high
4931123 i used to play a shot drag the beer crate around and jump up on it and play another shot i had a real passion for the game to play snooker i was crazy as a kid
4931124 there were five hundred guys in the audience rooting for him and three guys rooting for me that was a big win for me i thought that the whole world was against me but i really love that i got a big buzz off of it
4931125 as incidents have occurred before we cannot send an ambulance if we can hear more than five people in the background
4931126 i am done eating all right and i will keep my sweatshirt on and look now im gonna take a sip of my drink what do you think about that huh
4931127 service program campaign wve15 reprograms the engine control module software to improve combustion at engine speeds above redline preventing engine damage
4931128 the only lesson i ever learned from my family is the art of hustling its an art that has been perfected in my south central neighborhood for generations the word hustle is often portrayed negatively as something associated with crime or wrongdoing in my community a hustle is a means of survival
4931129 many come in the door saying im going to this two year school because my cousin went there and they havent done any research
4931130 they need to know that even if you have a grade point average in the twos you can still go to a college you can go to a cal state i see more students who are excited and expecting to go to college now
4931131 for some students the lightbulb comes on in the fifth grade and for some its in the 10th grade everybody has their unique path we need to have a system in schools to help these students
4931132 college summit allows students to do the kind of introspection we look for during the selection process
4931133 obviously we want to make sure students can do the work so they thrive here but we also want to know what attributes they bring to the table to make our campus a better place
4931134 some of them walked out today and said they had never written that way before or told anyone these things
4931135 that thug lifestyle my father perfected had slowly but surely worked its way into my bloodstream and changed the child my mother raised into a menace to society
4931136 im taking my newfound knowledge about life and the personal growth ive had and running with it
4931137 im confident that at the end of my route ill find success waiting once found my success will become my lifes true hustle
4931138 reread it inhale it and begin to dream i dreamt of a world entirely different from my own calm simple and undoubtedly serene i found that if i could be exposed to something as powerful as that by doing something as little as picking up a book there had to be an infinite number of sensations out there waiting for me to uncover them
4931139 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4931140 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4931141 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4931142 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4931143 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it

4931145 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4931146 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4931147 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4931148 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4931149 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4931150 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4931151 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4931152 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4931153 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4931154 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4931155 that markets all about showing off going out with your friends and saying look ive got an 82 latour here lets drink it
4931156 business is good weve got a lot of new customers now due to the olympics
4931157 its the same as before except the vendors seem a little more polite but the prices are higher too
4931158 then we saw someone else selling them at 10 pair for 50 yuan oh well
4931159 i knew they wouldnt shut this place up its too much of a money spinner
4931160 no other issue is likely to dominate the political scene
4931161 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4931162 recalled his wife aliza who did not object as long as the project didnt affect her

4931241 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
4931242 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4931243 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
4931244 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4931245 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4931246 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4931247 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4931248 i think youve got the right ideas i think you could do it
4931249 if you think you can sort it out then youd better get on and do it

4931256 they have done a traverse of g1 full and then went down to bc for rest and refueling
4931257 so it wasnt a traverse itself rather a double header
4931258 to me the high point of the climb was the traverse of g1 in pure alpine style alone on the route so hats off for this achievement
4931259 they are great and honest climbers and i am sure that they want us to admire their real achievements not ones they didnt do i am waiting anxiously for their original report

4931272 whether they will continue their traverse or not we dont know yet
4931273 all depends on conditions and how much time they have left
4931274 the main difference between the two parties is that the italians started on g2 and it took them 4 days from g2 top to the summit of g1 and 7 days of total climbing the poles started on g1 and it took them 11 days from g1 top to the summit of g2 and 20 days climbing
4931275 it is an incredible achievement for poland to revisit a very difficult conquest that remained unrepeated for 24 years
4931276 didnt jean christophe lafaille do a traverse on gi gii in 1996
4931277 jean christophe lafaille did a double header and a good one solo just 4 days between the two summits and opening a partially new route on gi there are 35 cases of climbers who did the same double headers on gi and gii are pretty common especially nowadays
4931278 but to do a traverse the climber must face the entire ridge between the two peaks traversed j c summited gi then came back to the bc of gi and then used another route to summit gii
4931279 he did not traverse the ridge between gi and gii the only two parties that did this traverse are kammerlander messner and now hamor morawski i advise that even hamor morawski will be investigated when the expedition is over to see if they really did a traverse or a double header until now everything conspires favorable to a traverse

4931305 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable

4931316 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4931317 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4931318 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4931319 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4931320 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4931321 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4931322 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4931323 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
4931324 b ut also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
4931325 a majority of the decision makers in europe agreed on a strategy of doing nothing to offend muslims and terrorism will disappear it led to demand after demand after demand to the point that the archbishop of canterbury is saying sharia law is an inevitability
4931326 there will be no large demonstrations of moderate muslims taking to the street saying please dont offend us
4931327 im not na ve about the fact that this kind of stuff can spread like wild fire
4931328 i also think that we cant be paralyzed by that kind of fear we need to be smarter than that fear
4931329 if they cant figure out how to outsmart a bunch of radical violent extremists who can
4931330 i do not want to spend any more energy discussing my book before it is published
4931331 a novel of womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith
4931332 i felt it was my professional responsibility to counter this novels fallacious representation of a very real womans life the author and the press brought me into a process and i used my scholarly expertise to assess the novel it was in that same professional capacity that i felt it my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
4931333 the spark that prompted them to start raising the red flags
4931334 anyone should have the right to publish whatever they want about islam or muslims even if their views are offensive without fear of censorship or retribution muslims however shouldnt be expected to be passive consumers of these views an offended muslim has the right indeed the responsibility to vigorously critique anything written about them or their religion provided they do not cross the line into intimidation and coercion in an ideal world both parties would open their minds enough to understand the other point of view getting people on both sides of this equation to follow these guidelines will take a lot of reconditioning but the alternative a hyper sensitive muslim community that is unable to constructively respond to external criticism or internal criticism for that matter coupled with a journalistic artistic secular community that feels genuine fear and is prevented from free expression cannot be an option we are witnessing today the stagnation and increased misunderstanding that comes from a stifled discourse
4931335 as a journalist for the last 28 years i hold the right to free speech especially dear the first amendment is in my view the very best thing about living in the united states publishing houses can of course do whatever they want but university professors ms spellberg urged random house to abstain from publishing the reason she is telling reporters now is that she doesnt like my book does this development mean our public universities no longer support the free exchange of ideas
4931336 dont have a history of pulling things thoughtlessly or in a knee jerk way
4931337 they are supposed to stand up for their right to say what they want especially in a work of fiction
4931338 you cant restrict speech based on the crankiest member of the community and the most reckless member of the community
4931339 there is so much out there about the wives of the prophet that offends rational people its all in defense of polygamy telling us fables of how all these women lived happily together
4931340 i expect there are any number of publishers who will say thank you random house for making all this free publicity for us
4931341 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4931342 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4931343 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4931344 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4931345 you might not like everything about your country eh it might not be the perfect place but its ours you might not think weve got the best laws but theyre ours the mountains might not be the prettiest ones or the tallest ones but theyre ours were fighting for whats ours men
4931346 okay den i fink ive worked it out if people are groophar stupid then well fight for groophar stupidity cos its our stupidity and dats good yeah
4931347 i realize i ought to know these things but what does groophar mean
4931348 good right yes i think ive got it thank you
4931349 and what youve got there my friend is patriotism my country right or wrong
4931350 the rich are getting richer and everyone else is getting hosed
4931351 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
4931352 the fans are growing up theyre not comfortable with a cover for people years younger than them
4931353 a book worth reading only in childhood isnt worth reading even then
4931354 ive never wanted to be a witch but an alchemist now thats a different matter to invent this wizard world ive learned a ridiculous amount about alchemy perhaps much of it ill never use in the books but i have to know in detail what magic can and cannot do in order to set the parameters and establish the stories internal logic
4931355 rowling said she couldnt answer the questions about the books religious content until the conclusion of book seven
4931356 if i talk too freely about whether i believe in god i think the intelligent reader whether 10 or 60 will be able to guess whats coming in the books
4931357 a childlike sense of wonder such as motivates many scientists and naturalists
4931358 i said you are nervous come on man you have played in super bowls
4931359 if you are expecting to play the same jets team from last year you are going to be in trouble
4931360 i think everybody was waiting on him to mess up or this to happen
4931361 man this is brett favre you can drop brett favre on mars and give him 10 other players and he can lead them to score a touchdown
4931362 they are going to be better with brett he is still going to win games
4931363 when you buy a legend like brett favre youre not just paying for the strongest arm in the game youre paying for a man who makes the guys around him better
4931364 ive been a jet fan all my life but ive never been to a preseason game
4931365 to be here for the first touchdown thrown by favre is unbelievable
4931366 i dont know if im a packers fan first or a brett fan
4931367 were devastated he left us but were pleased for him and want him to do really well here
4931368 i knew i was out there for the right reason
4931369 one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field like i did tonight i know i made the right decision
4931370 i couldnt have picked a better person to catch it from
4931371 hes the most legendary player in the nfl right now its just huge for me
4931372 i dont have one but i might build one for that ball
4931373 even after that drop i had to just keep on playing
4931374 i had numerous people on the redskins team tell me man it almost dont look right
4931375 like starting all over again i had some feelings i hadnt felt in 17 years
4931376 he was able to move the team down the field and put us in a position to score
4931377 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4931378 when you get jossled what comes out of your mouth is what you are full of
4931379 tear into a can of the meanest energy supplement in the planet monster energy we went down to the lab and cooked up a double shot of our killer energy brew its a wicked mega hit that delivers twice the buzz of a regular energy drink
4931380 improves performance increases concentration and reaction speed increases endurance and stimulates metabolism
4931381 top athletes busy professionals active students and drivers on long journeys
4931382 we knew we would get noticed against a thousand other energy drinks
4931383 in heaven there is paradise on earth there is suzhou and hangzhou

4931390 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
4931391 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
4931392 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4931393 no other issue is likely to dominate the political scene
4931394 so what do people who want to reach out to this group do
4931395 i get triangle hair like the girl from dilbert you know can we thin it out or layer it or something
4931396 dont you think that will grow into a pyramid when she gets outside
4931397 we call on the british government to apologise for the immense suffering that has resulted from their imposition of section 377 and we call on the indian government to abandon this abhorrent alien legacy of the raj that should have left our shores when the british did
4931398 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4931399 i cant believe they are making me walk home in a hurricane
4931400 this is just a perfect example where jim himes needs to understand the issues better the congress street bridge is something that chris has worked on but has not been a priority of the business council or the mayors of bridgeport
4931401 an entire swath of the city is cut off from the downtown area
4931402 i think its critical that the u s government and certainly our congressman be focused on the problems right here at home
4931403 i can tell you i certainly am taking no august vacation
4931404 i think it had everything to do with the strength of the candidates running on line b in bridgeport
4931405 i would expect that obama being at the top of the ticket would help himes it can make a huge difference
4931406 the campaign received the request and is communicating with the democratic congressional campaign committee to make sure we increase the democratic majority in congress come november
4931407 connecticut isnt the place where people blindly vote party line no one town or city decides an election
4931408 chris has been an integral part of the growth and expansion in the 4th district he has been an effective congressman and will continue to do so
4931409 the key is always getting your vote out john mccain and chris in many ways are both mavericks
4931410 theres no competition between what chris shays has done and what he stands for and what mr himes says hes for
4931411 the democrats have been writing chris shays obituary for years it still hasnt been published
4931412 it seems to me that this year we have a great chance of winning with jim himes because chris shays has lost touch with the voters of the 4th congressional district
4931413 he is a strong supporter of bush and thats very evident
4931414 chris votes against timelines that are unrealistic and supports a comprehensive energy policy that includes short term as well as long term solutions to the cost of energy today
4931415 the fact that were even talking about a different approach in iraq is because of the surge and the policies chris shays pushed for months ago
4931416 hes been to iraq he looks people in the eye who sends to war so he knows what hes talking about
4931417 theyre the ones who won in 2006 because they said things would be different the only thing different is gas is 4 a gallon
4931418 theres a tendency to blame the incumbent party and unfortunately hes wearing the republican albatross around his neck
4931419 the thing is with chris shays you just cant count him out
4931420 im not here to get bitched out im not touching it again
4931421 it was a life changing event for our whole family said her mom charlene lantz
4931422 it makes a huge difference in her quality of life
4931423 shes highly motivated and has great mental and emotional health
4931424 i see a lot of young people who are not as positive as she is
4931425 its really different you never know of the little things that you have to do im really dependent on other people now
4931426 there are just so many things that she needs we just have to make it work
4931427 im the one who tells wolf hey out of the break were going to call indiana im sort of the final decider in the chain
4931428 now not every day is going to be the same
4931429 we approached mccains trip to europe and the middle east the same way as we did obamas
4931430 both candidates are getting an awful lot of coverage were trying very hard to offer up large chunks on both of the candidates
4931431 he is a celebrity and celebrities tend to get a lot of coverage
4931432 i think the democratic convention is not only going to be well covered but i think its going to be of a lot of interest
4931433 well now your control room is an irrelevant parking lot
4931434 were going to be able to drive the bus in a few minutes over to mile high and be all set
4931435 its just a great tool for illustrating an explanation heres why we cant call indiana
4931436 were going to take it to the conventions with us itll be a main part of our november election coverage
4931437 its not often that you can get asked what can google do for you
4931438 i had this sort of crazy idea well maybe all the questions could come from youtube the people
4931439 we both quickly determined that this was a perfect match
4931440 its an opportunity for them to learn more about the candidates and make a more informed decision
4931441 theres pretty much no time off until clearly after theres a president elect
4931442 i was at the bill clinton speech that took nine hours
4931443 which is what feeds the creative juices which in turn fuels the country
4931444 the mishnah stands in contrast with the world to which it speaks
4931445 this language is filled with words for neutral things of humble existence
4931446 i felt i was closing in so i picked it up a little
4931447 i cant see straight right now but im so thrilled i cant believe it
4931448 its a really tough group of competitors most of them with multi olympics and or olympic medals under their belts getting to this point was a really big jump for us because weve never raced internationally
4931449 a lot of crews that we raced were very surprised to see us up here i think we might have ruined a few peoples regattas along the way thats the game and were very proud
4931450 lass uns in meine wohnung gehen ich h re jemand kommen

4931452 we hope that mr gambari would be able to revive the stalled dialogue
4931453 we have got to that stage in the investigation it is now a strong possibility we are much closer than we were
4931454 we had enough quality to win but two pieces of ill discipline cost us horribly
4931455 they were down to 10 men so we had a golden opportunity and we end up matching them with one piece of stupid play
4931456 then the last thing we said at half time was not to lose our discipline but three or four minutes later were down to 10 again i cant defend james hes been very good and very bad for us in this tournament
4931457 its got to a point when big hits to the body are more acceptable than little hits on the stick
4931458 unfortunately it took them scoring to kick start us we had our chances but we played ourselves out of it
4931459 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4931460 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4931461 today we are going to start by asking what are the top current influences making an impact on the creative industries today we will use the nominal group technique to develop a list from among your opinions now please split up into groups and come back in 10 minutes so we can pool your answers you understand me good lets go
4931462 de commercialization the death of consumer with a shift toward human needs

4931464 mike is my best friend and ultimately he is my soul mate hes the guy i want to do everything with the guy i want to be with when hes old and wrinkly
4931465 exchanged handwritten vows in an intimate ceremony attended by 19 guests
4931466 damn act like you know me even with the mask on show me what you owe me
4931467 nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4931468 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible
4931469 i have raced a lot before i know a lot about running
4931470 i think i performed quite well today although i couldnt catch ndereba i tried my best and im really satisfied with the result
4931471 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record
4931472 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4931473 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
4931474 i am telling you there is no case they cannot proceed the medical report is so clear in the event the judicial system is fair whichever judge hears the case will throw it out
4931475 you people are talking about sputnik and missiles you know they were created centuries before and used by our gods

4931479 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
4931480 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time

4931511 but its going to be a fun four years i think over those four years id like to try some new events ones i didnt do here
4931512 ive written down a lot of goals but this is the biggest dream ive ever had
4931513 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience
4931514 its something ill have forever i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible
4931515 im going out there to try to play quarterback as well as i can and let it go from there
4931516 we want to make a good decision and we will
4931517 im confident ill say it again i like all three of them i thought tonight all three of them did a nice job
4931518 as an offense you need to make some plays to get into a rhythm and to get a tempo going
4931519 tonight our tempo stunk i didnt make any plays so i take that squarely on my shoulders a lot of times a quarterback if hes making plays can get the offense going and i didnt make any plays
4931520 its our job as an offense to go out there and score touchdowns
4931521 tonight we moved the ball consistently and we want to keep putting the ball into the end zone
4931522 i missed two big opportunities the long ball to josh and the ball to jason in the back of the end zone
4931523 those two stick out other than that i thought i played pretty decent but when you miss two big chances like that you cant get it out of your head
4931524 the productivity wasnt there for the offense so i cant sit up here and say the quarterback played well
4931525 it was not a good evening for all of our quarterbacks
4931526 tit for tat good that niranjans house caught fire he was trying to take away my house now he is homeless himself

4931543 do whatever you want just dont get caught and if you do get caught blame it on someone else
4931544 it is meaningless to speak of imposing the formalizing activity of the universal mind of man itself a product of chance on a bottomless and shoreless ocean of chance the only possible foundation for science and philosophy as well as for theology is the presupposition that god as all controlling and christ as actually redeeming does actually exist and is actually known by man but to hold this position requires us to give up the idea that man himself is the source of unity in human experience in seeking such unity as only god can have apostate man cuts himself loose from the possibility of having any unity in experience at all

4931548 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4931549 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4931550 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4931551 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

4931556 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4931557 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4931558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4931559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4931560 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4931564 maintain a constant check on the number of addicts in any community it would also protect the life of the addict and support him as a useful member of society this existence would hasten his rehabilitation or at least reduce the amount of his addiction since many of the stresses in the addicts life would be reduced

4931584 i have always believed myself that in fact the creative department is like a factory and the job of a great manager is to have the
4931585 you must help your people and your clients to move to the next level to have higher expectations in terms of creativity
4931586 with great briefs you can have a successful company this is my own personal way to try to move things to the next level delivering great briefs to my people and at times you have to work closely with the client or even create your own
4931587 with a good brief sometimes you will have a good campaign but with a bad brief you will never have a good campaign this is the most important thing
4931588 creation is a process that happens to happen in the assembly halls and dont forget we are responsible for the quality bottom line we make possible everything
4931589 so the job of a great ceo of an advertising company is nothing more but creating a place where you have a higher chance to get and develop more great briefs than anybody else

4931592 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
4931593 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
4931594 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
4931595 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is

4931644 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4931645 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4931646 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4931647 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics

4931656 naar de klote gaan is iets wat je moet vermijden het is een soort van jezelf kapot maken maar dan een paar stappen verder verslaafden zijn naar de klote niemand wil verslaafd zijn maar waarom wil jij dit allemaal weten
4931657 volgens mij zijn we allemaal een beetje naar de klote hier het is gewoon ik weet niet wat het is een staat van welzijn maar jij bent nog te jong om naar de klote te gaan hoor je moet oppassen op jezelf

4931672 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4931674 with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7

4931676 not set expectations around the release that end up disappointing
4931677 features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
4931678 we can already hear apple and pessimists saying that windows 7 will be little more than a giant windows vista patch that uses multi touch support as a sales pitch

4931686 si hay una inversi n de dos mil millones de euros hay que respetar esos derechos
4931687 siempre defenderemos los derechos econ micos de las empresas espa olas
4931688 que los dos mil millones valen m s que las consultas populares que se realizan para determinar si es posible si quieren o no que una empresa explote sus recursos naturales y humanos
4931689 considera indiscutibles los derechos econ micos y los defiende por encima de los derechos humanos o los derechos colectivos de los pueblos
4931690 los pueblos ind genas son due os de las tierras donde viven
4931691 firm y ratific en 2006 el convenio 169 de la organizaci n internacional del trabajo por la que a grandes rasgos los pueblos ind genas y tribales son due os de las tierras en que viven y que usan acuerdo que no s lo les garantiza los derechos de forma individual sino tambi n los derechos colectivos como pueblos
4931692 acaso no saben o no quieren saber cu ntas y de qu maneras las empresas espa olas violan sistem ticamente el convenio y de paso los derechos humanos tal vez se crean esos imaginativos y falsos anuncios donde las empresas m s devastadoras son el concepto mismo de ecolog a y de bondad mundial

4931699 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4931700 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4931701 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4931702 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4931703 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4931704 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4931705 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

4931709 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4931710 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

4931718 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4931719 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4931720 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4931721 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4931722 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4931723 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4931724 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4931725 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4931726 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4931727 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4931728 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4931729 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4931730 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4931731 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4931732 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4931733 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4931734 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4931735 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4931736 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4931737 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4931738 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4931739 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4931740 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4931741 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4931742 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4931743 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4931744 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4931745 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4931746 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4931747 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4931748 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4931749 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4931750 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4931751 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4931752 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4931753 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4931754 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4931755 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4931756 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4931757 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4931758 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4931759 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4931760 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4931761 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4931762 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4931763 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4931764 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4931765 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4931766 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4931767 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4931768 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4931769 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4931770 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4931771 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4931772 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4931773 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4931774 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4931775 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4931776 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4931777 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4931778 the other girls were talking about going backpacking or going to bali but i get back on tuesday evening and on wednesday morning i have to take my daughter to school and i have a list of school supplies i have to get
4931779 i was mimicking how you do it i was with cate libby trickett and britta i think i was asking libby about whether she was going to have children or keep swimming
4931780 if it helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want do with being a parent then thats great
4931781 i was really nervous i wanted to take it out strong and come home as strong as i could
4931782 certainly it would have been something if we didnt do it
4931783 but its not like we were getting pressure to swim for mike we wanted to do this not just for mike but for ourselves

4931835 this mantra of elections is replete with red herrings craftily synthesized to maintain pakistan as a servile client state in order to carry on with the same bold imperial designs on the grand chessboard it is merely the rebottling of the same old wine in a different bottle it will surely be legitimately conducted with no apparent riggings and duly approved by all the impartial international observers to give the artful elections an official international legitimacy it is quite immaterial who wins in these elections the laws and the judiciary of the nation have already been reconstituted under the umbrella of emergency to enable the nation to carry on unfettered in its primary objective of fighting the war on terror as an obedient patsy client state and hence to carry on in its own devilishly crafted suicide

4931838 we dont have guns we dont have banks we dont have storm troopers and we dont have a powerful media what we have is our convictions our courage and our potential weve done a lot of research and weve done a lot of talking and writing what we have not done is taken the next step toward calculated revolution a revolution always begins with ideas and ideals these power the willing and cause the ranks to swell sometimes often the revolution becomes subverted and when the tables are turned the same people are still sitting there this is simplistic but most of you have a grasp of the minutiae and some sense of history real history
4931839 keep in mind when reading this that the man being interviewed is no two bit internet conspiracy buff
4931840 what is inconceivable in normal times is possible in revolutionary times
4931841 surely the united states dreams about iraq will not come true
4931842 one way of measuring the quality of your freedom is just to take a walk
4931843 its been a hard and painful training process for me but i just kept my head down and did my weightlifting and training
4931844 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4931845 i certainly have no regrets with my preparation and what ive been able to do here
4931846 ive come a long way in my swimming since world championships 18 months ago
4931847 ive been doing it for a long long time and its tough to stay there
4931848 he did a great effort good on him for winning he was the better competitor on the blocks tonight
4931849 ive been waiting for this moment for two years i had expectations for the 400 freestyle but this is a great surprise
4931850 im going to celebrate this appropriately its been two years since i havent gone back to my hometown im going to see my dad my friends my brothers and sisters
4931851 i felt good in the first 400 at 800 and 900 i started believing i could win
4931852 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100 to save energy and attack in the final 50
4931853 im happy for ous if it wasnt an american winning it then i would want him to win it
4931854 hes a great friend of mine and a great competitor hes as tough as nails
4931855 the gold medal will more than make up for his setbacks hes been training with a vengeance over the past year since that hiccup about a year or two ago and hes proven it every day in work out
4931856 im not going to decide now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4931857 im very aggressive i like to put points on the board i like to put on a show
4931858 i know im head and shoulders above where i was at this time last year
4931859 beating a world champion to make the team shows me im as good as about anybody in the world
4931860 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the bullseye
4931861 and as i get down into the bullseye is when i start to get on the trigger with my finger and as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
4931862 i guess i just set it off i got on the trigger a little too hard i didnt feel my trigger shaking but i guess it was it just hit the trigger the gun went off and i was like uh thats not going to be good i hope it hit the black
4931863 if the shot had made it all the way down to the bullseye itd have been pretty decent
4931864 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4931865 if hes pitching the way he is were going to score runs its unfortunate because hes had tough luck
4931866 its been a hard and painful training process for me but i just kept my head down and did my weightlifting and training
4931867 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4931868 i certainly have no regrets with my preparation and what ive been able to do here
4931869 ive come a long way in my swimming since the world championships 18 months ago
4931870 ive been doing it for a long long time and its tough to stay there
4931871 he did a great effort good on him for winning he was the better competitor on the blocks tonight
4931872 ive been waiting for this moment for two years i had expectations for the 400 freestyle but this is a great surprise
4931873 im going to celebrate this appropriately its been two years since i havent gone back to my hometown im going to see my dad my friends my brothers and sisters

4931878 the gold medal will more than make up for his set backs hes been training with a vengeance over the past year since that hiccup about a year or two ago and hes proven it every day in work out
4931879 im not going to decide now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4931880 unbelievable i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional
4931881 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
4931882 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4931883 any discussion of how to promote a healthy society offline as well as online must therefore pay close attention to links
4931884 so i dont think it has been settled that the web is intrinsically good though its obvious that most people do enjoy what they find on the web if it is good intrinsically then either its users should become noticeably more moral than non users or its rise should clearly make the world a better place if it could be convincingly shown that the webs presence improves the chances for world peace for human rights for environmental protection or other clear moral goods then the web could plausibly be called good in itself neither weinberger nor anyone else writing in this tome offers any such assurances at least not in any way i find believable

4931908 my aim wasnt to beat the chinese or any other nationality
4931909 when you look up at the scoreboard and see your dream slipping away it motivates you
4931910 we just stuck with it we need to win this game so badly we put a scare into ourselves
4931911 ive played against her for eight years and shes a stud youve got to force the ball out of her hands
4931912 i was really nervous i wanted to take it out strong and come home as strong as i could

4931920 or that man over there over dressed too neat over confident thinks he is too smart to be taken
4931921 but ultimately anyone can be conned if you have the balls to do it
4931922 you have to figure out someones wants and needs and convince them what you have will fill their emotional void
4931923 now you can prey on their emotions and do evil because con men are evil undeniably so

4931956 durante m s de una semana el pueblo de la naci n de georgia ha resistido el asalto de las fuerzas armadas rusas
4931957 el mundo ha observado con alarma mientras rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba un gobierno democr ticamente electo por su pueblo este acto es completamente inaceptable para las naciones libres del mundo
4931958 estados unidos y nuestros aliados nos alineamos con el pueblo de georgia insistimos que debe respetarse su soberan a e integridad territorial mosc debe cumplir con su compromiso de retirar sus fuerzas invasoras de todo el territorio de georgia
4931959 se podr n preguntar por qu los acontecimientos en un peque o pa s a medio mundo de distancia le importan a estados unidos

4931980 this shows that we dont want the end of belgium

4932009 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4932010 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4932011 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4932012 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4932013 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4932014 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4932015 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4932016 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4932017 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4932018 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4932019 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4932020 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4932021 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4932022 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4932023 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4932024 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4932025 man will ultimately be governed by god or by tyrants
4932026 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4932027 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4932028 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4932029 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4932030 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4932031 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4932032 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4932033 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4932034 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4932035 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4932036 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4932037 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4932038 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4932039 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4932040 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4932041 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4932042 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4932043 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4932044 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4932045 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4932046 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4932047 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4932048 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4932049 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4932050 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4932055 what the hell is this guy doing making this movie
4932056 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4932059 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4932060 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4932061 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4932062 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4932063 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4932064 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4932065 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4932066 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4932067 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4932068 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4932069 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4932070 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4932071 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4932072 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4932073 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4932074 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4932075 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4932076 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4932077 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4932078 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4932079 russian president dmitry medvedev has said we are to withdraw you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4932080 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4932081 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
4932082 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4932083 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4932084 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4932085 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
4932086 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
4932087 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
4932088 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4932089 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4932090 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4932091 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4932092 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4932093 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4932094 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4932095 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4932096 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4932097 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
4932098 i am telling you there is no case they cannot proceed the medical report is so clear in the event the judicial system is fair whichever judge hears the case will throw it out
4932099 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4932100 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4932101 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4932102 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4932103 i got a running back from arkansas and didnt have to make a trade
4932104 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4932105 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4932106 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4932107 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4932108 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4932109 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4932110 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4932111 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4932112 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4932113 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4932114 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4932115 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4932116 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4932117 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4932118 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4932119 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4932120 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4932121 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4932122 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4932123 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4932124 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4932125 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4932126 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4932127 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4932128 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4932129 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4932130 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4932131 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4932132 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4932133 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4932134 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4932135 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4932136 who are open to doing something on the production side
4932137 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4932138 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4932139 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4932140 pull the curtains and blinds on hot summer days or to turn off the computer when work is done or run the washing machine only with a full load
4932141 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
4932142 im thrilled to be one of the only stores to carry this sports betting book release
4932143 im happy we were able to release my sports betting book on time
4932144 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
4932145 this book speaks volumes about the impact of sports betting in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
4932146 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my sports betting students irregardless of what critics believe
4932147 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
4932148 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the sports betting industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
4932149 because the work that has been done in the sports betting literary area has been huge
4932150 were releasing vanderbie rullans work online in a weeks time
4932151 with the release of chanel takemotos new sports betting book were going to see record traffic levels
4932152 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major sports betting biographical novel release
4932153 and we expect to sell out very fast harken curts sports betting book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
4932154 pre sale polls show this new sports betting book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
4932155 and i believe donati dressens book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
4932156 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author bemrose barch who has pledged support for this system
4932157 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4932158 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4932159 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4932160 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4932161 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4932162 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4932163 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4932164 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4932165 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4932166 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4932167 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4932168 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4932169 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4932170 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4932171 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4932172 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4932173 were always hard on ourselves today our rhythm was off
4932174 its been tough on them but theyre brazil and brazil in beach volleyball is always going to be great no matter what
4932175 anda harus berterus terang kepada saya karena masalah anda bukan masalah sepele
4932176 ustad waktu masih muda saya bekerja sebagai perawat di rumah sakit
4932177 tapi saya mencari uang sebanyak banyaknya dengan berbagai cara tidak peduli apakah cara saya itu halal atau haram
4932178 saya sering kali menukar bayi karena tidak semua ibu senang dengan bayi yang telah dilahirkan kalau ada yang menginginkan anak laki laki padahal bayi yang dilahirkannya perempuan dengan imbalan uang saya tukar bayi bayi itu sesuai dengan keinginan mereka
4932179 tahukah anda bahwa perbuatan anda itu dosa yang luar biasa betapa banyak keluarga yang sudah anda hancurkan
4932180 di rumah sakit saya juga melakukan tugas memandikan orang mati
4932181 ya tapi saya memandikan orang mati karena ada kerja sama dengan tukang sihir
4932182 setiap saya bermaksud menyengsarakan orang baik membuatnya mati atau sakit segala perkakas sihir itu sesuai dengan syaratnya harus dipendam di dalam tanah akan tetapi saya tidak menguburnya di dalam tanah melainkan saya masukkan benda benda itu ke dalam mulut orang yang mati
4932183 suatu kali pernah seorang alim meninggal dunia seperti biasa saya memasukkan berbagai barang barang tenung seperti jarum benang dan lain lain ke dalam mulutnya entah mengapa benda benda itu seperti terpental tidak mau masuk walaupun saya sudah menekannya dalam dalam benda benda itu selalu kembali keluar saya coba lagi begitu seterusnya berulang ulang akhirnya emosi saya memuncak saya masukkan benda itu dan saya jahit mulutnya cuma itu dosa yang saya lakukan
4932184 masya allah saya tidak bisa bantu anda saya angkat tangan
4932185 anda harus memohon ampun kepada allah karena hanya dialah yang bisa mengampuni dosa anda
4932186 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4932187 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4932188 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4932189 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4932190 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4932191 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4932192 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4932193 there something i need you to know i love you mire than anything in the world im not going to meet new people i dont wanna meet anyone else you are like no one i have ever met before i promise i dont want anyone else but you

4932196 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4932197 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4932198 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4932199 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4932200 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4932201 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4932202 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4932203 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4932204 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4932205 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
4932206 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
4932207 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time

4932231 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4932232 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4932233 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4932234 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4932235 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4932236 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4932237 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it

4932240 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4932241 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4932242 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination

4932249 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4932250 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4932251 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4932252 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4932253 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4932254 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places

4932257 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4932258 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4932259 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4932260 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4932261 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4932262 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4932263 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4932264 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4932265 we happily congratulate dahal for being elected the prime minister of the republic of nepal this had to happen four months ago when the maoist emerged as the single largest party
4932266 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4932267 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4932268 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4932269 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
4932270 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
4932271 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
4932272 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
4932273 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4932274 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4932275 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4932276 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4932277 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
4932278 youve got a wholesale invasion the greatest invasion in human history coming across your southern border changing the composition and character of your country
4932279 but lopez lomong had a talent he was a gifted runner and because of that our country rescued him from the violence and poverty of the sudan
4932280 i didnt want to put my children through that any more
4932281 women like myself who immigrate from another country we dont know that we are protected by the law if somebodys abusing us
4932282 give us clarity that we have not had for the last several years in our district
4932283 the lower level officer who goes to their home and interviews a woman and investigates the crime is going to be much more familiar with the facts that officer is in a much better position to determine whether or not the woman cooperated with law enforcement because that officer actually investigated the matter
4932284 i just dont think they have the same connection or the incentive to really go out of their way and help this person because they dont know the survivor and they dont know anything about the case
4932285 there are still issues in the implementation of the regulations that we are working out but so far citizenship and immigration services has proven amenable to hearing about problems from the field and attempting to fix those problems as promptly as possible
4932286 to tell battered women whose abuse is so bad that they wanted to have their abusers arrested that it might be a year before they get work authorization
4932287 if you report the abuse you will destroy our family
4932288 the more you know the more powerful that you get
4932289 if you know that youre protected then you will be able to speak out
4932290 were a nation of laws and we must enforce our laws were also a nation of immigrants and we must uphold that tradition which has strengthened our country in so many ways these are not contradictory goals america can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time
4932291 our protest represents a magnificent interfaith effort to secure both fair labor standards at the plant and to demand justice for the workers who were rudely and unjustly arrested i call upon the government to enforce fair labor laws as strenuously as it seems devoted to enforcing immigration laws
4932292 this massive military mobilization sends a clear signal that we must take action now to prevent another criminal us war in the next few days and weeks we will be mobilizing in the streets against an attack on iran as we write we are preparing placards banners and printed material to take to the republican and democratic national convention protests we know that the only force that will stop the drive to war is a grassroots peoples movement
4932293 i miss grammy so much i want to cry are those happy tears im making
4932294 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4932295 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4932296 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4932297 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4932298 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4932299 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4932300 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4932301 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4932302 we just want to make our customers happy because we know its kind of high and we want to help them as much as we can
4932303 we care for the customers more than the money because we want them to come here and support us and we support them back
4932304 i dont understand why theyre so much higher than everyone else because my family lives all over the country my sister lives in texas my brother lives in florida and theyre both saying that the gas prices are 20 cents cheaper there than they are here and its a little frustrating
4932305 im going back to my parents and starting over on the internet to figure out how to get to minneapolis
4932306 where shall i cum a man can be strong with his woman but must also be able to surrender some in the passion of the moment i had almost forgotten about it gaywheels com has just most recently listed out the vehicles that took the most interest among all gay and shoppers jennifer was shocked at the aggressive sexuality of these pretty little girls and as she watched she was mesmerized by their erotic appearance asian lesbian html

4932309 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4932310 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4932311 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4932312 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4932313 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4932314 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4932315 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4932316 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4932317 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4932318 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4932319 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4932320 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4932321 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4932322 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4932323 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4932324 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4932325 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4932326 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4932327 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4932328 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4932329 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4932330 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4932331 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4932332 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4932333 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4932334 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4932335 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4932336 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4932337 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4932338 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4932339 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4932340 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4932341 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4932342 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4932343 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
4932344 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4932345 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4932346 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4932347 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4932348 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4932349 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4932350 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4932351 what do you want your look to say to people
4932352 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4932353 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4932354 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4932355 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4932356 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4932357 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4932358 they are unable to secure a seat in a program in the state of connecticut
4932359 lo m s formidable ha sido demostrar que nada es imposible
4932360 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4932361 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4932362 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4932363 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4932364 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4932365 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4932366 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4932367 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4932368 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4932369 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4932370 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4932371 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4932372 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4932374 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4932375 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4932376 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4932377 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4932378 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4932379 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4932380 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4932386 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4932387 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today weve got a chance
4932388 we were on top in the second half and controlled the game we had chances and torres took his hes a key player who can change games
4932389 i was disappointed with the result but very pleased with the performance i was pleased with all the new players but we just did not do enough to get over the finishing line with a draw
4932390 we took the game to fulham we did not sit back
4932391 there is a lot of excitement in the city that we are here for the first time and weve got something to build on
4932392 we were always in control but couldnt finish the game off
4932393 and you have that same old story that in the end you almost feel you deserve to be punished because there are 10 minutes to go and youre only 1 0 up
4932394 we had a physical game on wednesday night and i was a bit worried we wouldnt take the chances we created in front of goal
4932395 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish off what we created but when everyone is fit i think we will improve create chances and start to put them away
4932396 do i believe we will challenge manchester united and chelsea for the title yes why not
4932397 no i know i cant afford to go another season without a trophy
4932398 but i retain immense confident in my team what people seem to forget is we made 83 points last season and only lost three games
4932399 we finished four points behind manchester united and we should have won a trophy for the most unlucky team last year
4932400 but quality for me is the consistency my team shows and i am super confident we will be challenging for the title this season
4932401 when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4932402 if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4932403 after you can say it is not good enough to win it ok
4932404 but you have to accept levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap
4932405 we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries
4932406 we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4932407 i know we are not making the headlines with big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch
4932408 lo m s formidable ha sido demostrar que nada es imposible

4932414 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4932415 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4932416 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4932417 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4932418 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4932419 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4932420 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4932421 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4932422 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4932423 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4932424 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4932425 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4932426 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4932427 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4932428 the backbone to our success centers on a core philosophy that only those who are a quick study flexible self motivated resourceful and innovative and have the ability to collaborate with other professionals will be chosen

4932431 we received the order from the special investigation unit around 9 20 pm last night saying former president chen was barred from leaving the country
4932432 we took away accounting books and computers which could help with clarifying the case

4932436 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4932437 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4932438 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4932439 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4932440 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4932441 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4932442 they feel that because one incomprehensible thing constantly follows another incomprehensible thing the two together somehow make up a comprehensible thing
4932443 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4932444 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4932445 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4932446 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4932447 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4932448 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4932449 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4932450 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4932451 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4932452 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4932453 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4932454 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4932455 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4932456 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4932457 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4932458 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4932459 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4932460 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4932461 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4932462 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4932463 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4932464 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4932465 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4932466 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4932467 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4932468 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4932469 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4932470 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4932471 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4932472 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4932473 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4932474 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4932475 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4932476 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4932477 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4932478 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4932479 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4932480 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4932481 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4932482 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4932483 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4932484 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

4932488 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
4932489 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

4932491 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
4932492 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4932493 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4932494 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4932495 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4932496 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4932497 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4932498 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4932499 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4932500 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4932501 view my sexy adult profile yes i can post my real nude images there
4932502 successful living in these areas requires the ability to adapt to an indigenous culture in which the rules are unwritten
4932503 heres a shaht aht to all the people from the norside
4932504 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4932505 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4932506 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4932507 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4932508 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4932509 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4932510 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4932511 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4932512 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4932513 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4932514 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4932515 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4932516 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4932517 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4932518 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4932519 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4932520 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4932521 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4932522 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4932523 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4932524 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4932525 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4932526 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4932527 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4932528 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4932529 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4932530 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4932531 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4932532 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4932533 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4932534 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4932535 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4932536 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4932537 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4932538 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4932539 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4932540 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4932541 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4932542 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4932543 good judgement comes from experience but experience comes from bad judgement
4932544 we can never know that we are right we can only sometimes know that we are wrong
4932545 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it

4932552 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4932553 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4932554 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4932555 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4932556 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4932557 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4932558 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4932559 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4932560 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4932561 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4932562 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4932563 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4932564 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4932565 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4932566 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4932594 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4932595 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4932596 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4932597 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4932598 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4932599 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4932600 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4932601 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4932602 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4932603 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4932604 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4932605 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4932606 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4932607 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4932608 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4932609 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4932610 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4932611 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time
4932612 this reduces traffic congestion and fuel use and also saves time
4932613 i believe you should go out and do what you can rather than just complain or tell other people how to do the job he says
4932614 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4932615 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4932616 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4932617 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4932618 well either i can or cant theres only one way to find out
4932619 no im not im the opposite of complicated im a simple simple man i like my food plain and simple the bread company has a made a powerful and formidable enemy i shall never forget
4932620 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4932621 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4932622 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4932623 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4932624 the time of my mercy is coming to an end soon you must be a vehicle of that mercy of my love before it is too late
4932625 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4932626 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4932627 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4932628 i am the very model of a modern major general
4932629 i believe that we owe it to the citizens of our community to go beyond standard political speech and instead outline in clear terms the initiatives that will define us as representatives of our neighbors
4932630 now more than ever delawares taxpayers need a bill of rights and elected officials who are committed to fighting for those rights delaware was one of three states where the economy contracted in 2007 according to a report by the federal bureau of economic analysis disappointingly the same report ranked delaware last among the 50 states in economic growth thats unacceptable
4932631 as state senator ill fight for policies that end wasteful government spending restore fiscal discipline and create an environment where job creation can flourish again
4932632 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4932633 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4932634 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4932635 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4932636 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world no way we were going to let those guys down
4932637 he did something thats never been done before were happy to be a part of it
4932638 every single athlete in the world right now needs to tip their hat to michael phelps
4932639 it wouldnt have been possible without the help of my teammates
4932640 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4932641 everything had to go perfect everything had to fall perfectly into place and i was able to have probably the best week of my life
4932642 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4932643 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4932644 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4932645 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4932646 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4932647 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4932648 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4932649 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4932650 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4932651 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4932652 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4932653 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4932654 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4932655 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4932656 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4932657 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4932658 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4932659 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4932660 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4932661 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4932662 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4932663 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4932664 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4932665 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4932666 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4932667 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4932668 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4932669 thats why hes the he never lost his soul in chicago
4932670 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4932671 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4932672 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4932673 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4932674 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
4932675 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4932676 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
4932677 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
4932678 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4932679 thats why hes the he never lost his soul in chicago
4932680 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4932681 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4932682 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4932683 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4932684 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
4932685 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
4932686 the man ran from police and during the foot pursuit one of the officers fell and sustained a sprained ankle
4932687 the other officer arrested the man who was taken to surry hills police station
4932688 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4932689 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4932690 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4932691 its not a surprise we have been meeting with inpex fairly regularly and we met with them last week and they informed us that they were expecting the draft guidelines to come out soon but it is certainly a step closer to having a gas development in darwin harbour
4932692 then i would favour a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4932693 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4932694 do not remain content with the surface of things dont become a mere recorder of facts but try to penetrate the mystery of their origin
4932695 they must find it difficult those who have taken authority as the truth rather than truth as the authority
4932696 most people dont fail in life because they aim too high and miss most people fail in life because they aim too low and hit
4932697 you cant say you love your country and hate your government
4932698 there is absolutely no reason to speculate even to the slightest degree that i would not extend for a notable period of time
4932699 for that moment while theyre holding a card or picture of their loved one in one hand a loved one who was killed with their other hand theyre touching the warm face of tomas young
4932700 for a moment theyre allowing themselves to believe theyre touching the loved one theyll never touch again
4932701 all i knew was i met a man at walter reed hospital and i wanted everybody to meet him i wanted every american to meet him
4932702 lets connect the filmmakers the subjects and the leaders on the ground while theyre actually going through their platforms
4932703 so when congress goes back to work in september they will have some of these things top of mind
4932704 if you could put 10 films in front of the leadership and activists and delegates to shape the dialogue which 10 films would they be
4932705 its not a take your girl to the movie movie
4932706 i cant waterboard someone for not marching into a theater to watch a movie about a young man in a wheelchair there are no cg images theres no archival footage nothing goes boom in our film they think theyve seen it or they know what its going to tell them and they also know its not going to have a happy ending
4932707 the glow of nbcs olympics coverage ratings victory threatens to be sullied by reports that the beijing olympic committee and the network have been less than scrupulous in their presentation of the summer games
4932708 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
4932709 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by acclaimed filmmaker and opening ceremonies director zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation
4932710 do the phrases cinematic device and almost animation really convey that the image wasnt real
4932711 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
4932712 as a satirist i have great faith in the founders of this country who believed that power turns everybody to crap
4932713 i would expect the level of theater at this one to be shakespearean
4932714 and i say that having been a volunteer at the 1960 dnc in los angeles where i saw kennedys acceptance speech
4932715 politics in general is absolute bedlam its a big house of opportunity for comedians
4932716 it doesnt matter which side it is and it doesnt matter whos in office or whos got control of the house theres always going to be these various characters out there
4932717 comedy has always played a role in politics with late night talk shows and things like that but its more and more important with the rise of stand up on comedy central and especially stephen colbert and jon stewart
4932718 comedy is an entertaining form of commentary that augments the discussion because with political satire you can embellish and exaggerate and get upset about things
4932719 it wouldnt be right to make things up but you at least have the ability to use your imagination and creativity
4932720 a lot of undercurrents in the country are coming to the surface
4932721 whenever theres tension its always a good time for comedy but the comedy itself has to be insightful
4932722 i dont think its that theyre staying away from the race factor with obama
4932723 but it is true that he gets made fun of less its not just with comedians but perhaps the media in general
4932724 his rhetorical competence hasnt been seen since bobby kennedy so of course the joke files are sort of bare but i dont think theres any more of a protective shield around him especially if he gets elected
4932725 if anything happens that actually means anything ill be ecstatic
4932726 its preaching to the converted the last one i was running around at in boston i was like what are they doing this for its just a pep rally
4932727 it points out that theres utterly no attempt by either party to do what theyre supposed to which is govern
4932728 all they can do is tell us what the other side is saying and how awful they are thats not the job the job is to listen to the other side and come up with something that works with both
4932729 if youre a person who tends to suffer you will suffer as an actor even if you are doing a comedy
4932730 if you are a person who doesnt suffer then it doesnt matter if you are playing the worst villain
4932731 i am closer to this character than to the psychopath chigurh in no country for old men thank god but that doesnt mean i am this guy
4932732 the joy of the actor is to find the characters inside of you because we are holding all of them if you are not holding him inside of you you better run man and find him
4932733 you have to understand him there are as many different ways to do it as there are actors in the world what i like to do is start from the inside feelings not from the outside behaviors
4932734 he was making bold choices and when youre working with someone whos doing that you cant touch him you just have to stand back and let it happen
4932735 i know he had the admiration of the cast and crew because we knew he was doing something special you dont often get to see that on a movie set he was inside himself which is even better than being outside himself because thats where all the murky dark good stuff is he was using it all
4932736 philip seymour hoffman for me is one of the most amazing actors of all time theres no moment of not truth in his performances
4932737 when i saw hal holbrook in into the wild i have a heart attack almost and i almost have to leave the theater with the scene in the truck when he wants to adopt the boy thats an amazing intimate moment of a man who is really putting away the mask and transforming in front of the audience
4932738 casey affleck in the assassination of jesse james the whole journey is a piece of jewelry and tom wilkinson in michael clayton i havent ever seen a madman so funny crazy dangerous and the same time so heartbroken
4932739 so this award is a lottery that i won it doesnt mean i am better than the others
4932740 in the world of independent film a lot of performances get noticed and praised but often its because the director can only afford to shoot master shots and everybody is good in a master shot
4932741 its when the crew and the lights and the cameras pull in for a close up that inexperienced performers tighten up
4932742 as an actor i know how amazing denzel washington was in training day because hes doing all that invention with a co star and a cameraman stuffed into the car with him
4932743 he was a genuine american original and he will be missed by his friends which has to be about a million people
4932744 and by the time they left they were best friends
4932745 once jack starts to tell a story its hard to get him to stop
4932746 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
4932747 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
4932748 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight the audience
4932749 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4932750 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
4932751 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
4932752 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all
4932753 movement between moods often apropos of nothing is disorienting and makes me fear that i am not mentally stable
4932754 back perfectly straight tits out nipples and eyes facing master
4932755 im more at a loss for words than i was saturday
4932756 it just shows how much teamwork and how much togetherness we have its amazing to be part of it was a great experience for me and something ill have forever

4932764 do you know that april 27 is the feast of saint zita
4932765 shes a 13th century saint the patron saint of servants she believed devotion is false if slothful and considered her servitude a sacred task she obeyed her master in all things and thought of him as being placed over her by god
4932766 on the day of the feast you are to go to a dark place
4932767 go there and strip sit as i showed you before your body is deep in supplication as your eyes close your naked humble body will be transported to a vast empty desert with a harsh sun do not move your body embrace any pain you experience and drink it in six feet in front you imagine an altar to saint zita i am manifest as a large bird of prey circling in the sky above you watching pray for ten minutes no more no less

4932806 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4932807 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4932808 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4932809 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4932810 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4932811 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4932812 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4932813 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4932814 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4932815 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4932816 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4932817 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4932818 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
4932819 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
4932820 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
4932821 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
4932822 s till obama has yet to answer questions whether he dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
4932823 obama has made clear repeatedly that he stopped using marijuana in college which peers have affirmed
4932824 yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and come follow me
4932825 it is highly unlikely the death of this man is accidental
4932826 we do not know what happened or how this happened
4932827 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4932828 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4932829 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4932830 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4932831 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4932832 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4932833 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4932834 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4932835 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4932836 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4932837 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4932838 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4932839 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4932840 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4932841 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4932842 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4932843 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4932844 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4932845 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4932846 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4932847 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4932848 no monthly setup or gateway fees regular transaction fees are 2 0 20 per transaction
4932849 google has lofty aspirations that apps with docs in tow will extend its reach into medium size and large companies and to that end has been boosting its security and administration features particularly in its fee based premier version
4932850 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4932851 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4932852 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4932853 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4932854 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4932855 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4932856 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4932857 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4932858 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4932859 this has a chance to be the best group ive ever played with
4932860 we just want to knock heads we want to smash people we want to win games its a good feeling being a part of this
4932861 we lost a great player but weve gained other very experienced players
4932862 most important we have depth this year which we didnt have at all last year
4932863 jordon was obviously a phenomenal player but we really lacked the depth and experience
4932864 we only had a couple guys that played and jordon really made up for that with his outstanding play i probably have the most experience out of the inside guys now so i definitely try to show the young guys things that ive learned from being out there
4932865 whereas last year we had one guy who set the tone for everybody
4932866 i think we learned a lot from him about making plays and playing with controlled aggression
4932867 everybody likes to hit and everybody likes to go to the ball i saw that right away
4932868 im totally thrilled i realized i shouldnt have filed my nails last night but its my best time ever as much as i wanted to win im very happy i got the silver
4932869 shes really remarkable she gives me hope for another 20 years
4932870 to put things in perspective she was talking about childbirth in the ready room
4932871 i talked to some of the girls about what theyre doing next
4932872 theyre backpacking to paris going to bali they asked me what im doing well i leave here at 10 30 tuesday night and wednesday im taking my daughter to school and i have a list of school supplies to buy
4932873 i know dallas is a lot bigger and taller than our linemen so it was a big change up for us and ill say we responded well we came out in the first half with a lot of energy
4932874 plenty of rain lots of clouds yeah i felt just right at home
4932875 it took a lot of pressure off certain people and kind of got it into attack a lot better
4932876 its the longest 94 minutes i think ive ever had in football
4932877 we were all willing the players to get a result
4932878 before we got here we werent getting a lot of those big hits
4932879 weve been doing that the last couple of days so that was nice to view slide show of rockies nationals series evaluate boxscores team leaders and more on rockies stats page ask troy e renck about the team or mlb in the rockies mailbag study previews probable pitchers lineups and in progress gamecasts for nl and al pore over pre game stats matchups boxscores and live scoring for nl and al post photos of you and your loved ones showing rockies spirit see
4932880 it felt pretty good but i got a little tired in the sixth
4932881 i felt it a little bit running the bases it was a little crazy
4932882 i felt coming in it would take two starts for him to get his feet underneath him
4932883 i think hes in a lot better place now than he was when he joined us he did fatigue in the sixth i just think it was some residual rust but there were some really sharp sequences before the sixth that were really good to see
4932884 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4932885 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4932886 it was the same shots i was taking the last couple games they just went in tonight
4932887 that comes from putting in the extra work in practice before practice getting in a little better shape it paid off tonight and im going to continue doing it until the tournament is over
4932888 as a team theyre working better together more intense and theyre playing with a purpose to show everybody else that theyre superior
4932889 i was really proud how we came into this game focused especially on the defensive end when we get everybody on the same page its kind of hard to beat us
4932890 hes reached a level that no olympic athlete has ever achieved
4932891 i could see over four years him making 40 to 50 million those are big big numbers
4932892 at that point youve got to extrapolate the value out over the year and obviously youre talking hundreds of millions
4932893 what he has done is told sponsors you get me for four years
4932894 there will be great stories out of this olympics and great stories into 2012 the last olympian who did that was carl lewis
4932895 the image of phelps cheering the relay i think it did more for him than any single moment
4932896 his individual accomplishments stand on their own but that human side of him is most appealing
4932897 just the idea of cheering so hard for his teammates transcends what sports are all about it transcends that hes not only a great competitor but a great teammate
4932898 im in it because i love what i do it was something i dreamed of as soon as i started swimming winning an olympic gold medal and in athens i was able to do that ive been able to surpass my goals
4932899 im having fun at what i do and i do it because i love it im living sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if its really real
4932900 hes just a normal person although he may be from a different planet a planet from another galaxy
4932901 i didnt know track and field could affect the whole world like owens did
4932902 when i came back to my native country after all the stories about hitler i couldnt ride in the front of the bus i had to go through the back door i couldnt live where i wanted
4932903 i wasnt invited to shake hands with hitler but i wasnt invited to the white house to shake hands with the president either
4932904 dude its ridiculous how many times i have to see your ugly face
4932905 in middle school i had an english teacher who said id never be successful
4932906 i would rather win it at 82 80 than lose it and stay at home at 92 70
4932907 i dont think 500 will get in that would surprise me
4932908 ask cardinals manager tony la russa if he thinks theres such a thing as a bad record for a division winner
4932909 he has taken full advantage of that he has been one of the keys to our success he has shown strong leadership
4932910 the first thing i asked him was wheres the rest of you
4932911 went the right way i went the wrong way after football hes looking good hes an animal
4932912 i had to get a real life and put football on the shelf i got into fitness and became a runner
4932913 we make fun of him on the picture he has in the hallway
4932914 he was 300 pounds and now hes about 220 we tease him
4932915 not necessarily the five best offensive linemen but the five toughest will play for me
4932916 you dont need to be 330 pounds you need to be able to move your feet and be physical
4932917 we have a little bit of depth here and that breeds competition
4932918 so many people said it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4932919 its gone from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to winning the 400 free by nine one hundredths to getting my best time in every event
4932920 it has been nothing but an upward roller coaster its been nothing but fun
4932921 anything could happen i just wanted to go out hard and hold on as strong as i could
4932922 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to come together as one unit
4932923 for the three olympics ive been a part of this has been by far the closest mens team weve ever had
4932924 i just want to help the team any way i can
4932925 i just look to do the best i can with every at bat
4932926 its fun to be up there and have the game where you can change it
4932927 brad has been in one of the most consistent zones hes been in offensively in a long time
4932928 im confident we are going to see the real vizcaino before the season is over
4932929 i think his confidence is back in a real good place
4932930 i would be playing their position doing something better and theyd be like go play softball
4932931 we had as many as six or seven in years past but as softball has become more organized and competitive our numbers were at one last year
4932932 in 2009 i would guess we will not have any girls playing competitively in bbl out of 400 players
4932933 i think at a certain age those boys throw harder and youre seeing in baseball the pitch is coming at you a little different i am not saying boys are more talented but physically at that age it was competitive playing with them
4932934 if they had a good baseball coach then they would have an advantage if they had a bad coach then who knows how good her fundamental skills would be i will say that it may be harder to hit a smaller ball and the baseball does jump off the bat more quickly so there are benefits to playing baseball
4932935 playing with the guys youre in a tougher environment and probably going into high school i might have a little advantage
4932936 the game is much faster and more entertaining i think its more appealing to girls
4932937 they dont have anything to lose out on everything is pretty much the same except for the bats baseball can have the same intensity as softball its just like the perspectives are different its a different swing and different place the ball is coming from
4932938 i think its fun she gets to be in a unique situation but i also am just watching her play ball im proud of her and its fun to watch her out there competing with the guys
4932939 the guys at first are going to hound you and you have to be ready for that the media attention will come theres a lot of things you have to take into consideration you have to be really grounded and have a good work ethic
4932940 it feels great she has a personality that keeps us grounded she takes one play at a time she doesnt get big headed for sure were pretty proud the way she held her head up its hard being the only girl
4932941 once girls hit a certain age they dont want to play with the boys anymore im sure once these girls hit a certain age theyre not playing with their friends anymore and boys are chewing and spitting and its just not a girlie thing
4932942 personally i dont know anyone if they can keep up with the guys i say its good for them i love softball but i love watching baseball i say good for them if thats what they choose to do
4932943 i learned to keep my mouth shut they didnt see me as a little girl they saw me as an athlete and a teammate
4932944 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4932945 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4932946 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4932947 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4932948 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4932949 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4932950 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4932951 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4932952 girl you look so good and you love that im so hood you love my s 550 you want to test drive with me im from the home of biggie you and trina from the same city we met one night at you was sitting at the end of
4932953 wont you touch me the way that i want you to boy i want you to break me off why dont you just break me off break me off just some of that good love
4932954 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4932955 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4932956 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4932957 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4932958 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4932959 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4932960 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4932961 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4932962 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4932963 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4932964 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4932965 web based products have enormous flexibility and often grow change as they mature take for example the e commerce site zappos they originally began by selling shoes online but have since begun to sell clothing and fragrances as well when the ceo of zappos talks about his company he is justifiably adamant that the zappos brand represents great customer service yet the zappos logo prominently features a shoe sounds like it s time for a new logo
4932966 i love it it gives us a cohesive look with our brand and lets us keep our designs fresh on our customers minds
4932967 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm
4932968 if cross firing in any way led me to meet katy i can honestly say i would crossfire a million more times
4932969 as far as the work that is bar none probably the best one ive ever had
4932970 if i had the newspaper id like to read about it too its a pretty good story
4932971 when either one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4932972 the past few days have seemed like something of a roller coaster ride
4932973 i didnt know i was going to run so fast
4932974 but i came out to be a champion and i was i just tried to stay relaxed im always relaxing thats the way to go so fast relax and just focus
4932975 i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it
4932976 my hamstring felt good it didnt bother me i wasnt too overwhelmed with this being the olympics maybe i could have used some more training or more races but besides that i was just trying to get my rhythm through each round
4932977 i called my cousin who fishes catfish at lake mcconaughy in nebraska and asked how to catch them he told
4932978 we put down in the channel and had a dozen in the first hour and a half
4932979 i was pretty calm until i got on the trampoline
4932980 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
4932981 i was just hoping it would warm up and go away but it got really stiff
4932982 after the halfway nobody comes with me and i am pushing harder
4932983 my coach tell me if the pace is slow the first half you can push harder the second one
4932984 in the last kilometers i was looking back because i didnt want to lose the medal
4932985 i thought it was just tendons they get hypersensitive leading up to a marathon
4932986 i was icing it this week it didnt affect how i was training it was a bit sore when i woke up
4932987 for the longest time my health has been the dark cloud on the horizon of my family and me for the first time the sun is out and shining bright for the whole family
4932988 now my health isnt the predominant focus of everybodys day and we can really focus on the kid
4932989 i think it took more out of me than i thought
4932990 i dont think i ever felt like that after a race i could barely walk down the ramp with eight laps to go i remember thinking i wish i had only four laps to go and i dont think thats ever a good mentality to have
4932991 by the time 2012 rolls around ill have everything dialed in
4932992 none of us ever expected to get back alive after the third day out
4932993 we just kept going on because there was nothing else to do
4932994 i shouted for half an hour but there was no answer the place was deserted
4932995 every time i look in the mirror i live the olympics
4932996 we were fighting for what we did not have fully the civil liberties that white folks had even though the laws said equal rights
4932997 you couldnt do it anywhere else but where we did it
4932998 i met those guys last year for the first time and i have a lot of respect for those guys what theyve been through and how they overcame it and how that made them better people
4932999 you had a country that was in turmoil against the background of a burgeoning civil rights movement and black power movement it made sense to me that athletes had a role and an obligation to move the ball up the field
4933000 a great reason why the civil rights movement was going at a snails pace
4933001 was that our human status was being impugned and challenged in american society that we were not seen as completely equal as human beings
4933002 the 68 olympics were a tableau of the cultural and political stresses of the era
4933003 the year 1968 was the year of the youth revolution
4933004 anyone can speak their mind on political issues if they want to
4933005 but i think now a lot of people play it safe you dont want to offend anybody or get anything riled up
4933006 the rule says that athletes cannot make political religious commercial or racial propaganda or demonstrations inside accredited zones
4933007 i think the most important thing to do is be true to who you are as an athlete and as an individual
4933008 seize life and help someone else have an opportunity to seize life as well
4933009 each individual who saw it read into it their own plight
4933010 those of us who stood up in the eyes of the world we stood on a very lonely island we certainly did very prideful but lonely knowing it was going to be rough
4933011 once they gathered themselves they showed their venom and disdain they said we disgraced the flag we disgraced the olympics we disgraced this or that anything but what the real point was
4933012 the media led people down the wrong road im representing olympic project for human rights and then they say well call him a black militant they didnt even give the people the opportunity to evaluate it themselves they just shoved it down the peoples throats that these are two black militants
4933013 in fact i gave up money to bring about a point
4933014 my first wife took her life as a result of what happened in 68
4933015 the victory stand was for people who were afraid to stand up by themselves who had no platform
4933016 the victory stand gave people impetus to start thinking about doing something and once people started standing up one by one the victory stand became a symbol of black pride
4933017 listening to them speak it meant to me that if you really believe in something you can make a change you can make your voice heard
4933018 they cleared the path for everyone of color today and for the whole world for equality and civil rights
4933019 is one of the young folks who is reaping the benefits of those who went before him
4933020 it makes me want to go put on my track shoes
4933021 i see two principal problems i want to devote the bulk of my energies to in the course of the next five to 10 years
4933022 one is the doping issue and everything that goes with it nothing will happen unless that gets better
4933023 the second major element is that we are arguably the second most popular sport in the world that doesnt have its rightful place in line with the american public and the main reason is that there is no rational business model for the sport
4933024 there was a fair share of criticism over what ive done
4933025 im just not afraid of the criticism when i think im doing the right thing
4933026 it has poisoned our sport and choked the life out of it
4933027 i dont think the sport ever had a heyday and fell down from it
4933028 i think it had the attention of the sporting world for a period of time and it squandered that capital
4933029 i pray this year we dont have another incident of that nature
4933030 that would be step one getting the blue ribbon event of track and field back to the level where somebody wins on merit we must get back to there otherwise we are morally bankrupt
4933031 we have not worked hard to push and promote and get the sport on television
4933032 i dont think we have been visible enough vocal enough public enough celebrity enough to be able to promote
4933033 we have to look inward and see what it is that we have to do as marketers to have more people see what we do
4933034 we have to do a better job of creating a product that fits the scale of television and is attractive to a prospective television viewer
4933035 ive described our sport as being a pretty good chevy in the 40s and 50s driving down the road at 40 or 50 mph
4933036 today its still a pretty good chevy driving down the road at 40 or 50 mph but other sports have become ferraris
4933037 shalane flanagan is exhibit a of the turning of the tide
4933038 deena and meb had to come in and succeed in an environment where no american had done it in 20 plus years the trickle down effect of that has been massive
4933039 hes reached a level that no olympic athlete has ever achieved
4933040 i could see over four years him making 40 to 50 million those are big big numbers
4933041 at that point youve got to extrapolate the value out over the year and obviously youre talking hundreds of millions
4933042 what he has done is told sponsors you get me for four years
4933043 there will be great stories out of this olympics and great stories into 2012 the last olympian who did that was carl lewis
4933044 the image of phelps cheering the relay i think it did more for him than any single moment
4933045 that moment means more because we all watched him cheer his individual accomplishments stand on their own but that human side of him is most appealing
4933046 just the idea of cheering so hard for his teammates transcends what sports are all about it transcends that hes not only a great competitor but a great teammate
4933047 im in it because i love what i do it was something i dreamed of as soon as i started swimming winning an olympic gold medal and in athens i was able to do that ive been able to surpass my goals
4933048 im having fun at what i do and i do it because i love it im living sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if its really real
4933049 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4933050 it has been a battle and we feel we have two very good quarterbacks
4933051 but at this point we have to get one guy ready for the opener against ohio dax will get the start but karsten needs to stay sharp and i know he will
4933052 he thought it was a tweak and hopefully its nothing more than a tweak
4933053 this is a place where they utilize veteran guys very well and when someone has a track record youre interested in being a part of that
4933054 irrespective of what was going to happen playing wise or snap wise just being here to see him to talk to those young safeties a good leader is definitely missed
4933055 well probably only play him 10 12 plays just get him some playing time to get him in better football shape over the next couple of weeks
4933056 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4933057 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4933058 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4933059 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4933060 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4933061 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4933062 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4933063 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4933064 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4933065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4933066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4933067 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4933068 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4933069 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4933070 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4933071 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4933072 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4933073 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4933074 the authorities make announcements on radio and tv that sufficient supplies are reaching to the valley but there is no stock at the ration depots
4933075 to fetch half a quintal of rice i had to approach to more than a dozen shopkeepers
4933076 one of the first times that i saw barbara when she was awake in the intensive care unit she asked me why i wasnt coaching the team
4933077 that was the kind of importance she placed on what were doing but if she wasnt in stable condition i wouldnt be here
4933078 we certainly had no expectations that he would coach or be able to return but hes our coach and we function best when hes there
4933079 baseball activity is really the furthest thing from my mind right now
4933080 hes feeling good and we wanted to get him out there as soon as possible
4933081 i feel good ill go out saturday and see if i can win a game
4933082 i look deep inside my soul and wonder what my father would tell me
4933083 im not going to be swimming when im 40 no way
4933084 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4933085 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4933086 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4933087 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4933088 i look deep inside my soul and wonder what my father would tell me
4933089 im not going to be swimming when im 40 no way
4933090 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4933091 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4933092 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4933093 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4933094 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4933115 its hard for me to work on it because you dont want to hurt guys in practice just playin
4933116 seriously weve been working on it youll be able to see it in a couple of weeks
4933117 i love to hit especially when all ive got to do is run at somebody thats fun thats just fun
4933118 theres a lot more hard hitting and a lot more concentration
4933119 you can see a difference between early in the year when they would lose focus or miss an assignment that doesnt happen as much any more
4933120 all i know is weve got a bunch of athletic guys back there who are going to be ready to go out and hit somebody when aug 30 comes
4933121 its kind of supply and demand and it gets pretty competitive
4933122 we understand why theyre doing it because they have an opportunity to make a large part of their athletic department budget
4933123 but at the same time its mind boggling to think how a decade ago these games cost around 200 000
4933124 i dont have a crystal ball to see how its going to change
4933125 it means were always going to have a i aa team on the schedule because you can get them for 300 000
4933126 everybody is doing it and fiscally weve got to do it as well
4933127 we did it with sam houston state two years ago because we were really in a bind for that 12th game
4933128 but philosophically we said were not going to do that again
4933129 is definitely needed we rely on it for a lot of our revenue
4933130 one million dollars will be the situation well be looking for
4933131 but i also never thought id see the day when the nfl would pay a college kid 30 million whos never played a snap or watch a guy win a golf tournament on a torn acl

4933138 um i really dont have a lot of experience ive been here a couple of years but i havent had a lot of experience
4933139 id rather have a group of inexperienced athletes who are talented than an experienced group that wasnt talented
4933140 im really excited about this young group of talent theyre young and theyve got a lot of things to offer weve been through this drill before a number of years ago when we were forced to play a lot of young guys early but they were much like this they were very athletic
4933141 all played at a young age back there and they grew up fast
4933142 curtis and chykie have come a long way and theyre doing really well and aaron williams is doing a good job so thats really helping our competition with deon beasley and ryan palmer
4933143 right now those five guys all of them have a chance to play we have to figure out how we play them how we substitute and what does that mean
4933144 if a guy is good enough to play then its our job to make sure that we dont disrupt our starting team and dont disrupt the chemistry of guys playing together
4933145 were really inexperienced with our safeties and weve got to find somebody fast earl is a guy who likes to play hes very passionate and hell hit you
4933146 weve just got to make sure we give them enough to be competitive with the other teams and give us a chance to win and not too much to overload young safeties really none of them have any experience
4933147 its exciting because all of us are young with the exception of ryan palmer whos playing great right now
4933148 were all young we have two or three years together so its going to be interesting not only for this year but for the upcoming years also
4933149 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name
4933150 then when i saw 50 58 and 50 59 and the one next to my name thats when i sort of let out my roar
4933151 after the prelim swim i was man ill be lucky to make the final and i did that
4933152 to be close to getting a medal and not win one is disappointing but at the same time i dont feel theres much room for disappointment right now
4933153 i think right now i need to go back home and take a long break and stay dry for awhile usually when i was younger if i was dry for more than a month i started itching to get back in the pool and i havent had anywhere close to a month off in eight years so i think i need that right now
4933154 his strength is coming back on the second 50 because hes not going to get tired and other people do
4933155 it was a painful race and my legs hurt a bit
4933156 it was my last race here and i wanted to give it everything
4933157 my grandpa passed away last year and my gram passed away three days before i got here
4933158 its early and with any injury im going to be upset or down im just going to get back in rehab and see what the problem is and try to fix it
4933159 im sure he will find ways to tie the university closer to indianapolis
4933160 the execution wasnt bad penalties hurt us i was talking to wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we over came a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
4933161 it possible that i could have broken it i have to go back and look at it but that was my first one it cant do anything but get better because all i do is work hard
4933162 i talked to stew and last year we got after those guys and blitzed them a lot
4933163 he said that he got some e mail from some offensive coordinators saying this must be youre first time being an defensive coordinator because you broke the etiquette of just playing vanilla we did a lot of base stuff i would have loved to really get after them but we played what was called
4933164 i just stalled the engine close to the end in a hairpin
4933165 there are a lot of hairpins in this stage and its very easy to stall and thats what i did but its not a problem i didnt try to push too hard this morning i didnt try to go fast
4933166 im driving slowly and not taking a lot of risks but its okay and im happy
4933167 sometimes its more difficult to drive slowly but im driving with confidence and its going well
4933168 we can go flat out and try to catch him thats all we can do
4933169 its much better to fight than to slow down so were going to go flat out no question
4933170 its still very close but im not taking too many risks on the first loop
4933171 im checking the notes and ill push on the second run
4933172 its not going right but we just have to keep going we came over a crest there was a kerb we just touched the kerb and after that we had a slow puncture
4933173 what i said was they have a very talented football team and they are the most talented team in the state of texas we cant match them up with talent but we can sure as hell try to out hit them and win the game on turnovers and that sort of thing
4933174 i dont remember questioning their toughness i was actually assessing their talent
4933175 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team

4933205 i know of an investor who lost more than 50 metric tonnes of macadamia this season he employed brokers who bought macadamia very early before the harvesting season
4933206 lured by good prices offered i uprooted 100 coffee bushes and planted macadamia plants in 2000 and 2001 i hoped the industry would keep flourishing and i would live a comfortable life after i retire
4933207 the local investors had agreed not to buy the nuts before march when they start falling down we did not think that foreign buyers would take advantage of the situation and move to the farms before us
4933208 we had advised the farmers to form common interest groups and we gave them loans to improve on macadamia farming we employed experts to train them on modern farming practices and gave them farm inputs we also took some farmers for further training in established farming training institutes but all our efforts have now been watered down
4933209 we estimate that will take three weeks after which a 21 day notice will be sent out we expect it to be held in september
4933210 its important farmers are convinced that major changes will be effected to revive the organisation the farmers are restless over the future of their union and would like the minister to intervene and possibly disband the board of directors
4933211 its important that farmers deal with this issue once and for all its a colonial relic and makes the organisation look like a man wearing two suits the directors wear the suit that is convenient for them at different times
4933212 this is a great challenge to shareholders to make conscious efforts to reverse the trend where they shifted business to kpcu competitors while at the same time expecting the company to be financially strong
4933213 the bulk of the debtors have since migrated to our competitors mostly for purposes of avoiding the repayment of debts owed to the union

4933223 its good that they know the offense and they know what theyre doing
4933224 but its good when you have all your guys out there and you practice with the guys who are really playing in the games with you
4933225 you certainly would prefer to have all of your starters out there getting the repetitions they need in order to get themselves into game ready shape but it also provides an opportunity for some of the young guys to step up and become contributors this year we were encouraged by what we saw its not the ideal way you design it but i think were making the best of it
4933226 is not helping we just dont see anything hes in every meeting but he doesnt get to rep it for a young guy they need to do it

4933308 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4933352 ive come a long way in my swimming since the world championships 18 months ago
4933353 ive been doing it for a long long time and its tough to stay there
4933354 hackett led with less than a third of the race to go but mellouli was in charge for the final 400 meters
4933355 he did a great effort good on him for winning he was the better competitor on the blocks tonight
4933356 ive been waiting for this moment for two years i had expectations for the 400 freestyle but this is a great surprise
4933357 im going to celebrate this appropriately its been two years since i havent gone back to my hometown im going to see my dad my friends my brothers and sisters
4933358 i felt good in the first 400 at 800 and 900 i started believing i could win
4933359 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100 to save energy and attack in the final 50
4933360 melloulis training partner for the last four years larsen jensen of the united states finished fifth

4933397 we want to support the pcb particularly world cricket needs pakistan cricket to be strong so we need to support them but at the moment only on this point of time with a lot of happening in pakistan we have a lot of concerns
4933398 who knows that somewhere in the future very soon those concerns wont be there and we would be able to tour pakistan as we did in 2002 and 2003 ultimately its the iccs and the boards decision to make what they want to do well have to wait and see what reports does the task force give back to the icc next week
4933399 things were quite stable in the country at that point its different now as it appears there is a lot of instability within pakistan with the taliban the government things were not bad in 2003
4933400 another key difference this time is that there will be eight teams on the ground its a lot lot harder to strengthen out security measures with so many teams going to different practice venues ground areas that is principally a concern of ours and we would want to see that demonstrated that is a major difference for sure for us
4933401 although we havent been there as for 12 years we know that cricket is a sport and we shouldnt be subjecting the players to risk we cant go anywhere if the security advice says its not safe and at the moment we are not quite ready to make a decision we would certainly be making a recommendation to our board of directors sometimes next week
4933402 dave richardson and his security advisors talked about the commitments made by the pcb to protect the aussies and other cricketing teams during ct
4933403 tim may former australian spinner is now head of global fica also talked and about the meeting that he had been very impressed with the upgraded activities by the pakistani authorities
4933404 players expressed a member of concerns about what they heard and seen from pakistan and they were very interested in commitments the authorities have made
4933405 they discussed it as a fact that they have been there previously and they were very keen to understand the specific commitments around the hotels at venues and in particular about the security during travelling between hotel and venues
4933406 he lawson said he wasnt there on behalf of the icc or the pcb he wanted to speak as an aussie who is living in pakistan to discuss his lifestyle in pakistan and how he lives his experiences and how he travels around but feels very safe and comfortable and undertaking his work on behalf of pcb
4933407 we have the icc our own security company and we have access to other security advice and intelligence what well be doing is that we will be adding the iccs advice to that store of information and make a recommendation to our board of directors i will expect that will happen sometime later this week

4933875 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
4933876 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
4933877 it maintains self renewal or the cells ability to make more and more cells of its own type and it maintains pluripotency meaning that the cells have the potential to become any type of cell in the body

4933941 exposure to bright sunlight in the morning is a great thing to do to retrain the brain
4933942 if you have a patio area serve them breakfast out there that helps them get the brain going

4933957 neurologen en muziekpedagogen weten dat al lang maar nu is de intelligentiebevorderende werking van muziek door een amerikaanse studie daadwerkelijk aangetoond

4933989 had a pretty good scrimmage i dont think we had any serious injuries im sure we got some bruises out there but both groups had a good time its wasnt like one of them got the first out of the other one of them didnt dominate i mean offense got their share defense like they got their share offense had too many i think they had three fumbles they fumbled on a fourth and one and fumbled on the third and one you cant do that had a couple of interceptions good plays by the defense its pretty good we came out this morning to work on the kicking day worked on the kickoffs worked on the field goals worked on punting we really had a good day of it thought it was not a bad first scrimmage the kids held up pretty good it did get hot out there today
4933990 the fumble exchanges killed us a couple times fourth and one and a third and one tough in the red zone thats where weve got to get better were working a lot on it but we hope to get better well keep working on it then there are some things offense didnt run down there that i thought would have been real good against goal line defense but then they wanted to look at something else sometimes youre wanting to look at certain plays under certain circumstances that might not be the best i think we can solve that

4934012 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4934013 i have to say ive learned more about my book in the years since its come out having had access to some of those discussions than i did while i was working on the book
4934014 often one of the things that comes up is a discussion of the moral choices that the characters in the book must make
4934015 and its wonderful to hear what readers takes are on that
4934016 his brothers were not criminals by any means but they had various kinds of troubles through their lives and my father was the white sheep of the family and sometimes was called upon to help his brothers out of various kinds of trouble so when i was growing up i knew there was this conflict in my father as he was pulled in different directions
4934017 the book i had written before montana 1948 was very long and i just sort of put everything in as i was writing that book
4934018 so i decided that with the next novel id take the opposite tactic and whenever i had a decision to make on whether to put it in or leave it out id leave it out and see what happened
4934019 my first novel was published with so little effort on my part
4934020 it wasnt the heartless thing that it sounds like but it was exactly what i needed to hear and needed to remember that if i kept writing i might have little chance but if i quit id have no chance
4934021 and as soon as i did that i thought oh you idiot what have you done it had been 13 years since i had a novel published and here i had one on an editors desk and i asked him to send it back
4934022 and so i sent it to milkweed editions for their annual contest and it worked
4934023 i always tell them if you have an interpretation of the book and you can support it with the text itself then its as valid as anyone elses
4934024 libraries are facing competition from television magazines the internet e books yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late
4934025 its all so negative unprofessional and unbusinesslike like any business libraries need not to alienate their customers
4934026 my personal view is that theyre past their sell by date because they do sustain a very old fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with todays modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project tolerant responsive flexible stimulating
4934027 ive met plenty of ex borrowers who say they paid a few medium sized fines and decided it was cheaper and more convenient for them to buy the books and stopped using the library
4934028 no one would argue against a parking or speeding fine if we didnt have speeding fines it wouldnt mean that people behaved better on the roads
4934029 if fines were removed as an income stream no matter what the strength of argument might be it would seriously challenge the budgetary position of many library services
4934030 when fine income is being used by libraries to run libraries i think its madness
4934031 weve got to the stage that our fines are now paying for the library service
4934032 we never have enough copies of driving theory test manuals or the life in the uk citizenship books on the shelves how do we stop borrowers from keeping the books for the months up to their tests and depriving other users i dont believe the public are all selfish but it only needs a very small percentage of bad apples to cause problems
4934033 this is primarily a matter for library authorities but clearly it is in the interests of all library users that books are returned on time mla best practice advice would to recommend that authorities politely alert customers before they go overdue and to avoid the word fine in preference for charge

4934085 there is now strong evidence from three randomized controlled trials undertaken in kisumu kenya rakai district uganda and orange farm south africa that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired hiv infection in men by approximately 60
4934086 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
4934087 just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications
4934088 we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
4934089 circumcision status was not associated with any sexual dysfunction or with specific sexual dysfunctions premature ejaculation pain during intercourse erectile dysfunction at follow up visits
4934090 and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
4934091 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviors are unlikely to increase they may even decline as we saw in our study
4934092 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
4934093 studies to date have demonstrated efficacy only for penile vaginal sex the predominant mode of hiv transmission in africa whereas the predominant mode of sexual hiv transmission in the united states is by penile anal sex among msm men who have sex with men
4934094 constitute a covert and unacceptable risk transfer from male homosexual and bisexual community to the community of blood recipients such a transfer would be both unreasonable and unfair
4934095 because hiv risk behaviors are relatively well understood it is possible to classify men along a spectrum of risk with uninfected msms who have been in an exclusive monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner at very low or even zero risk
4934096 it is my concern that indefinite deferment of donation from very low risk msms provides only illusory safety while other practices which have allowed hiv positive donations to occur have been continued

4934220 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
4934221 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
4934222 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4934223 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
4934224 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
4934225 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
4934226 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
4934227 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
4934228 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
4934229 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
4934230 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
4934231 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
4934232 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
4934233 what would the united states do if suddenly mexico became an iranian or russian ally theyd crush every last mexican one way or another
4934234 em londres vou estar na torcida pela larissa j vou estar com minha bengalinha at l aprendi a admir la aqui a respeit la como mulher ser humano antes eu conhecia e admirava a larissa jogadora

4934236 the only lesson i ever learned from my family is the art of hustling its an art that has been perfected in my south central neighborhood for generations the word hustle is often portrayed negatively as something associated with crime or wrongdoing in my community a hustle is a means of survival
4934237 many come in the door saying im going to this two year school because my cousin went there and they havent done any research
4934238 they need to know that even if you have a grade point average in the twos you can still go to a college you can go to a cal state i see more students who are excited and expecting to go to college now
4934239 for some students the lightbulb comes on in the fifth grade and for some its in the 10th grade everybody has their unique path we need to have a system in schools to help these students
4934240 college summit allows students to do the kind of introspection we look for during the selection process
4934241 obviously we want to make sure students can do the work so they thrive here but we also want to know what attributes they bring to the table to make our campus a better place
4934242 some of them walked out today and said they had never written that way before or told anyone these things
4934243 that thug lifestyle my father perfected had slowly but surely worked its way into my bloodstream and changed the child my mother raised into a menace to society
4934244 im taking my newfound knowledge about life and the personal growth ive had and running with it
4934245 im confident that at the end of my route ill find success waiting once found my success will become my lifes true hustle
4934246 reread it inhale it and begin to dream i dreamt of a world entirely different from my own calm simple and undoubtedly serene i found that if i could be exposed to something as powerful as that by doing something as little as picking up a book there had to be an infinite number of sensations out there waiting for me to uncover them
4934247 the international knew that there were allegations of impropriety many years ago this is not news to them
4934248 when our firefighters look at this memorial they dont just see names they see friends they see memories and sometimes they see what could have been themselves
4934249 we are so grateful to everyone who has given so much of themselves to create this hallowed place where we can remember our friends who have given everything
4934250 you can lean down on one knee and run your finger across the name
4934251 the main reason they died is because they were put in harms way
4934252 whether they died of electrocution smoke inhalation crashed helicopters or a difficult situation they were working to save lives or property
4934253 as a result that amount of equipment was not used again
4934254 with the gray building fire we learned that too much water can do as much damage as a fire can
4934255 its better to penetrate buildings find the seed of the fire and use hand lines
4934256 when i first saw a flower i just saw a flower now i see so much more
4934257 i dont think i would have graduated without this class senior year
4934258 ive learned what city kids can do if given a chance to grow in the garden
4934259 i dont see us at this moment picking up that program

4934261 i dont understand why we have to kill the fish first if were going to kill another fish
4934262 the goal is to provide experiences for kids who are growing up in a part of los angeles that has historically been disconnected from the ocean
4934263 how many of you all have been on a boat
4934264 these kids have to deal with gang violence and regular occurrences of shootings in their neighborhoods
4934265 they live under pressures that a lot of kids in los angeles dont have
4934266 you realize youre taking brand new steps in a brand new world
4934267 their reaction to this is different than what i thought itd be
4934268 but just being out here with nature fresh air its good
4934269 if one of my offenders is arrested ill get a notice
4934270 its a good case study that these sort of projects have to be actively managed when a project like this gets off the rails you have to fix it
4934271 the department of corrections when it got off the rails they kind of tried to hide it and thats not good
4934272 undertake a feasibility analysis to investigate the acquisition and development of a part of the capitol lake budd inlet isthmus as a public park
4934273 initiatives to my knowledge have never been successfully used in the city of olympia
4934274 theyd like to be in it but we leave that for the children
4934275 the kids put a lot of work into following their parents instructions

4934305 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
4934306 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
4934307 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
4934308 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
4934309 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
4934310 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
4934311 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
4934312 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
4934313 nik aziz pas leader said the holding of a quran to declare one was telling the truth was more an imitation of the christian practice of swearing on the bible
4934314 my government is not in danger i am confident of its survival i hope a middle path can be found out to resolve jmms grievance

4934319 hi hows your summer going have you been staying out of trouble x
4934320 my summer is all good and hope yours is too but lets not go here again since we want different things from it
4934321 goddamn lets have just one more night of wine and naughtiness
4934322 well look at the report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4934323 the implications for the budget long term are serious were doing it in a responsible way and we dont make any apologies for that either
4934324 i think it is important that we have an adequate pension system because decisions in this area do cost an enormous amount of money
4934325 and whatever we do has to be affordable but also in the long run it has to be sustainable
4934326 this government has had eight months already to do something about pensions
4934327 they could have funded a 30 a week increase to the single pension in this years budget by foregoing tax cuts for people earning more than 75 000 a year
4934328 our position over the long term is for a 100 a week increase to provide pensioners with a decent quality of life
4934329 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4934330 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4934331 martini sure and why dont you get a steak over here
4934332 the girl notified adults who went out and retrieved the child
4934333 its so sad because nobody has to do that any baby can be taken to a church or to a fire station or a hospital
4934334 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
4934335 fire personnel are going from house to house to put out any remaining fire
4934336 we couldnt be happier with the support we have received from the local community
4934337 their support has helped limit the damage and bring this fire under control
4934338 you always do this to me spontaneously so i thought that i should return the favor vasa you are one in a million and i thank god for bringing you into my life thank you for listening and for letting me run to you in times of confusion or when im crying and what have you you know i love you and ive told you this before you have a place in my heart and i am so happy to have such a person like you in my life thank you for being understanding and for thinking that im never a bother or some kind of annoying bug may you have a great rest of the night dont eat so much candy and ill talk to you real soon gnight love you v dizzle muuuah buh bye
4934339 im glad to see youre still writing because i love listening you and your fam are def in my prayers youre strong i know you are and youll get through

4934344 mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory

4934346 jennifer his skirt looked like something that you 8 year olds were making in 4 h
4934347 i was delighted with third place at the russian open although i was slightly disappointed that i didnt win the competition i played well all week i didnt look at the leaderboards and just focused on playing my shots if i keep putting myself in positions like that a victory will come soon
4934348 harrington has come alive now he has moved to a different level by becoming back to back open champion and winning a second major this season with the uspga championship it just shows that if you keep focused on your goals then you will eventually get there
4934349 i think the european tour is getting tougher there are more and more players trying to get on the tour now i think there are about 150 players now all trying to make it you cannot rest on your laurels anymore as there are always players pushing you to perform
4934350 oltre la fatica abbiamo sperimentato anche i momenti di deserto in ascolto della parola alla ricerca delle tonalit dellamore di dio che ognuno di noi ha rintracciato a partire dallesperienza di s
4934351 i find him to be a man of great courage and great conviction
4934352 we have gotten attention that we have not sought or enjoyed
4934353 we have had many many conversations about faith we will continue to have more
4934354 it was the kind of town where your best friends dad gave you your driving test and your neighbor was your math teacher
4934355 if you ever did anything wrong your mother knew before you got home
4934356 when your world is small and very ethnocentric you arent conscious of how others live when i went to college i was awakened to segregation and the problems
4934357 i just happened to be the pastor here when somebody in the church decided to run for president
4934358 i preach christ i preach about jesus if everybody knew his message the world would be a better place
4934359 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4934360 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
4934361 stringent control measures are taken at the time of athlete accreditation for all official fig competitions further all athlete ages for the beijing olympic games are consistent with the fig records for all past fig competitions
4934362 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4934363 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4934364 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4934365 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4934366 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4934367 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4934368 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4934369 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4934370 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4934371 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4934372 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4934373 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4934374 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4934375 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4934376 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4934377 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4934378 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4934379 these measures if passed will chip away at isps current mere conduit status by making it possible for national governments to pass laws or allow civil actions to force isps to co operate with authorities or other interested parties such as the music and film industries and disclose information on users and their online behaviour at telecomtv we believe this is fundamentally wrong and will damage internet neutrality along with european citizens civil rights and liberties

4934384 suiko st20 is extremely rare and most strange japanese electronic musical instruments originally made for japanese traditinal music circa 1980 and this one is very rare version of suiko st20 with recording function its built in cool brown custom suitcase like ems synth one side of the suitcase is a speaker so you can play without external amp or mixer but dont worry it has audio output too keyboard itself is built in beautiful brown metal plate look cool these keyboards were very expensive and made very limited quantities those days so its very hard to find even in japan nowadays this is your first and last chance to get this vintage gem it has 2 rows of button keyboard this keyboard specially designed for playing glissando easily like koto japanese harp front row of the keyboard is japanese scale so just playing randomly you can easily get exotic japanese melody there are various switch and dial for special japanese tuning and sustain and octave switch three sounds are selectable shyakuhachi japanese bamboo flute koto japanese harp and pipe organ sounds are very analog warm and strange this is very rare version of suiko st20 with recording function you can record your play and playback or play with built in music

4934422 we believe the arbitrator did a good job and that it is a fair contract in line with similar workplaces in quebec
4934423 it shows that even after three years workers at wal mart like all canadian workers can exercise their freedom of association rights and get a decent collective agreement
4934424 ik vind het prima om aan de schandpaal genageld te worden maar niet op deze manier ik ben gepakt op letterlijke uitspraken
4934425 ik noem geen getal dat werkt alleen maar tegen je geloof me we gaan terrein terugwinnen en fors ook
4934426 we hebben de doelen die we onszelf na de talpa deal hadden gesteld dik niet gehaald

4934432 then we saw someone else selling them at 10 pair for 50 yuan oh well
4934433 i knew they wouldnt shut this place up its too much of a money spinner
4934434 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4934435 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4934436 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4934437 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4934438 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4934439 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4934440 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4934441 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4934442 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4934443 certainly it would have been something if we didnt do it
4934444 but its not like we were getting pressure to swim for mike we wanted to do this not just for mike but for ourselves
4934445 for such an individual sport we really know how to get together for those relays
4934446 no other issue is likely to dominate the political scene

4934452 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4934453 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4934454 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4934455 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4934456 john mccain has supporters but barack obama has believers and i think that makes a difference
4934457 i wouldnt necessarily call new jersey in play but at the same time were not going to take any votes for granted
4934458 shes been in political campaigns on every single level shes been on the national scene with the carpenters so its not foreign to her what she has to do here
4934459 if they truly believe that new jersey was not in play if they truly believe that this was a gimme they would not have put tricia mueller in charge
4934460 i think new jersey voters expect candidates to come ask for their votes
4934461 democrats at the end of the day will all be there
4934462 they might not be rushing toward the finish line but theyll be there
4934463 clearly its not going to hold up under the stress of me going out there every five days and throwing a lot of pitches
4934464 i feel like i just have better games against them
4934465 the least they could have done was given us a gift
4934466 the feature saves the buyer at most just a few hundred dollars a year the annual value of the forgone interest

4934469 according to local legend two demons live below the spring and are engaged in a never ending battle when the good demon gets the upper hand water pours out of the spring if the bad demon takes over the flow miraculously slows down
4934470 what are we full cycle recruiters supposed to take away from all of this
4934471 get on the phone and ask for information are you kidding me me get on the phone and names source thats so not in my job description i so wasnt hired to do that
4934472 you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition what youll discover will be wonderful what youll discover is yourself
4934473 if un forces withdraw a new situation could arise which would give the egyptian deployment an offensive character
4934474 the post suez period is over it is not merely a matter of freedom of navigation if israel does not respond to the closure of the straits there will be no value to its credibility or to the idfs deterrent power because the arab states will interpret israels weakness as an opportunity to assail her security and her very existence

4934481 then go to your schools foundations division on their web site theres often scholarship money that doesnt get distributed because students dont want to take the time to write the essays or do the paperwork
4934482 doing it like they do it on the discover channel
4934483 my weight has always fluctuated and no matter how much weight i lost through diet and exercise i have always had certain stubborn areas of fat that i just could never seem to shift during the x factor i lost just under two stone but my body was still quite a boxy shape having liposuction has completely changed my shape giving me curves in all the right places clothes look so much better on me now and i feel a lot more feminine and in proportion i am so please with the results
4934484 mya ensured i understood that having liposuction is not a weight loss solution but is more about re shaping the body making it more streamlined
4934485 i did experience some bruising and swelling which is typical of the liposuction procedure and i really started to notice significant results after a few weeks once the swelling began to go down a couple of months on i cant believe the change it has made i never thought i would ever fit in to a pair of skinny jeans and now i do and they are a size 10 12
4934486 she was the most popular judge and was really good to me and my family
4934487 cultural intelligence generally refers to an individuals ability to effectively engage in multi cultural settings and operate well internationally and with a range of cultural groups and people
4934488 individuals who have international travel experience can more readily internalize the intended benefits of the cultural intelligence experiential training approach the implications to business and education are significant
4934489 organizations seeking people best prepared for global management training should take into account a candidates level of travel experience
4934490 these people will often internalize global management training more effectively
4934491 if we let people see that kind of thing there would never again be any war

4934503 it avoids an executor a trustee and becomes strictly a contractual arrangement
4934504 they can make a claim as a forgotten heir and ask for a share of her estate unless she specifically disinherits them in either her will or her trust
4934505 if you look at the sheer number of food oriented startups that make it it is a very small percentage
4934506 how does it make you feel do you enjoy it does it touch something in you then it is a great work of art
4934507 this one is flowers and flowers make me happy that one is a dude screaming and screams make me sad
4934508 a diet of nothing but classics is just as damaging as a diet of pop culture
4934509 if were really going to be a player we need to think more about making the products that those countries are used to getting
4934510 were probably a fairly large portion of that export market
4934511 at the end of july we still had 21 4 million cash on hand which gives us plenty of money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4934512 by the end of august we will be able and happy to report that we have no more cash on hand in the old primary account that being said we will have access to over 100 million in the first week of september
4934513 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington we are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than two million donors to the obama campaign who will provide the backbone of our campaign to put america back on track and reject the old politics and failed bush policies which is all john mccain is offering
4934514 too many women are putting off learning about money matters they say theyre too busy too tired or its all too hard to understand
4934515 its the competitive nature of women to keep up appearances
4934516 people are inclined to put things on credit even if they cant really afford it
4934517 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married saturday night in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
4934518 id love to but im single and i cant afford to buy anything on my own nobody would give me a mortgage
4934519 unless you have got the key to start the engine it isnt going to go is it
4934520 it means ill have to wait for my retirement proper
4934521 the market is telling us to change and to change right now
4934522 we are certainly telling them about the new things were going to be doing to assure something like this doesnt happen again
4934523 it is clear that far fewer homeowners are finding a way out of foreclosure
4934524 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
4934525 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity
4934526 he did offer one suggestion the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants he said
4934527 he estimates the number of new households in the u
4934528 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
4934529 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
4934530 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4934531 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
4934532 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
4934533 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
4934534 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
4934535 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
4934536 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
4934537 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
4934538 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
4934539 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
4934540 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
4934541 what would the united states do if suddenly mexico became an iranian or russian ally theyd crush every last mexican one way or another

4934544 theres been major speculation about our senior coach and its started to get beyond a joke in recent times
4934545 i went on the record earlier this year to say that terry wallace would coach the richmond football club for his full term
4934546 i said it when greg miller was sacked i dont know how many other times ive got to say it
4934547 richmond has not interviewed any other coaches no one from the board has approached any other coaches from any other clubs and nor do we intend to approach any other people from any other clubs this year
4934548 terry wallace will coach the richmond football club next year unless he tells me something different
4934549 theres been speculation from a few media people that richmonds in crisis that were an instable club
4934550 weve had one termination in the last five years at the richmond football club that was greg miller in the last couple of weeks only one
4934551 our chief executive has been with the club for nearly five years now the last richmond coach to be sacked was 12 years ago
4934552 but the media seems to think that every time something goes on at richmond we sack a coach our last two coaches danny frawley and wallace will have served at least five years
4934553 there have been no other major richmond departures the only board change in the last four years was greg miller stepping off the board earlier this year i dont see where the perception of instability is coming from
4934554 weve improved immeasurably as a club this year were on the cusp of making the finals
4934555 but we know where were at big losses to geelong and adelaide in the last couple of weeks have shown that were not at the top end of the scale get the best of foxtel
4934556 we played periods of good footy weve got some players who arent in great form at the moment which makes it hard
4934557 theyve got 22 guys who are prepared to tackle and chase and do all the hard things we certainly havent got anywhere near 22
4934558 paul bevan for consistency over four quarters hes one who really stands out
4934559 hes hungry hes a young kid who has a lot of desire hes a really good competitor he has a good pedigree in terms of his rugby league background
4934560 hes a really good kid and he wants to compete every week and thats the trick in afl footy
4934561 he played on the norm smith medallist and then went to the possible 2008 brownlow medallist so it was a reasonably tough evening for the fella
4934562 i just hope we can get on top of it soon because if we continue to lose games we are a chance of not making the finals at all
4934563 are just looking for the place that gives them the best bang for their buck
4934564 the amenities and personal services at grigio were the main reason i chose to live here
4934565 what separates us from buying an apartment somewhere else in the city
4934566 we want you to have the amenities and services of a hotel but feel like its your home
4934567 amenities that are super efficient classy and very useful yet not too expensive
4934568 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
4934569 its very interesting that after the signing of this agreement that russias troops continue to take more and more cities and villages on the georgian territory
4934570 we believe that the united states western countries and all international organisations will press russia to stop their activities and to began leave territory of georgia
4934571 armed gangs of the abkhazian separatist regime together with units of the russian regular army shifted the administrative border of abkhazia towards the enguri river
4934572 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4934573 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4934574 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4934575 jaaahaaaa natuurlijk moet die friet met mayo wat dacht je dan magere sladressing
4934576 so now you know these a little known facts that i know
4934577 restaurant chains bennigans and steak amp ale filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection today and stores owned by its parent company will shut their doors
4934578 and i strongly encourage everyone to get it too im already using it for theater projects and other ideas but its such a nifty program i think anyone and everyone can get something out of it and if you have a phone with web access its even cooler check it out youll be happy you did
4934579 as long as were at the table were going to keep pursuing that
4934580 todos los espa oles tienen derecho a disfrutar de una vivienda digna y adecuada los poderes p blicos promover n las condiciones necesarias y establecer n las normas pertinentes para hacer efectivo este derecho regulando la utilizaci n del suelo de acuerdo con el inter s general para impedir la especulaci n
4934581 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4934582 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4934583 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4934584 eu gostaria de tentar algumas provas novas provas que n o tentei ainda que n o fiz aqui para depois ver o que acontece bob bowman seu treinador disse que quer testar coisas que n o fizemos antes testar novos m todos ser o quatro anos divertidos

4934590 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4934591 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer

4934600 its important to get victims sworn testimony early on before the pressure starts building up
4934601 by having early contact with them theyll know right away whether we are seeking a prison term for the defendant or if we think probation is more appropriate
4934602 meeting them early on also lets victims see that someone is on their side
4934603 empowering for the victims because they get to confront the defendant and describe the events under oath and the defendant has to hear it
4934604 during the grand jury proceeding its the grand jurors listening to an officer give a recitation of the facts
4934605 domestic abuse as a whole is just something people dont talk about
4934606 its one of the most dangerous secrets we have and increasing the awareness of the problem is always good
4934607 domestic abuse is all about power and control and anytime were strong about accountability it helps
4934608 is schizophrenic taking thorazine has five felony convictions and a history of filing false police reports
4934609 this is going to enable us to better protect the victim and to handle these sorts of cases in a more expeditious manner
4934610 theres a lot of people who got left holding some pretty big bags that couldnt afford it
4934611 one of the countrys largest mortgage lenders is a home grown company from tucson
4934612 i think weve opened our eyes up to what could possibly happen and are better able to read whats going on in the market
4934613 i also made sure they were paid i had to eat that loss as well
4934614 theres a lot of people who got left holding some pretty big bags that couldnt afford it
4934615 ive never been through bankruptcy ive never thought that i would endure this through my career
4934616 not unlike a multi car pile up in which first magnus was somewhere in the middle
4934617 clearly if alan greenspan fannie and freddie and wall street didnt see it coming it is unrealistic to assume that first magnus did
4934618 id like to see the whole thing just wrap up and we hope that happens pretty soon
4934619 i couldnt even tell you what kind of dollars will be coming back to the creditors
4934620 the only ones that made out well on it are the law firms

4934659 the days events left her completely exhausted her strength drained
4934660 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4934661 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4934662 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions

4934675 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4934676 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4934677 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially
4934678 this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4934679 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4934680 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4934681 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4934682 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars
4934683 these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4934684 im really concerned with the new principle that the college is promulgating and that is that doctors do not have the right to be guided in the conduct of the practice by their conscience
4934685 thats a sweeping broad principle to establish and once youve established it the field is wide open for further changes
4934686 there are a lot of doctors who feel uncomfortable with this and think its detrimental to the childs welfare down the road the way were reading this draft document is a doctor could be hit with a misconduct
4934687 with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days

4934691 chairman prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4934692 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4934693 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4934694 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4934695 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4934696 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4934697 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4934698 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4934699 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4934700 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4934701 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4934702 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4934703 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4934704 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4934705 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4934706 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses

4934709 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday
4934710 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
4934711 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4934712 historical experience but also from the interests of corporations that think they will make a lot of money in russia
4934713 by today or tomorrow as there is no room for any delay
4934714 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4934715 the instability is of course causing concerns in pakistan but it is also not in the interest of pakistans western allies
4934716 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4934717 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia

4934724 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4934725 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4934726 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4934727 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4934728 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4934768 i think people do want to see films but it is tough
4934769 one time in this town in one day pirates of the caribbean was played 52 times a small independent movie played up against that doesnt have a chance
4934770 it is these little festivals that reignite everything what is lacking is cinema going as a community activity we are too busy flogging it making the bucks as opposed to thinking about what the thing is
4934771 the edinburgh international film festival is the chicken the ballerina ballroom cinema of dreams is the egg
4934772 when you say 5 leaves do you mean small leaves or large normally big leaves for the vegetable shakes i make with kale or collards

4934780 clear pattern with repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender management mechanisms in the uk
4934781 the government is turning a blind eye to the activities of british sex offenders abroad
4934782 britons who travel abroad to abuse children in the belief that they can evade justice are a uk problem and we have a duty to protect every child everywhere
4934783 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
4934784 i love rhubarb and have done the crumbles but since i found that i have to watch my sugars ive been on a mission to find a fabulous savory recipe for it since i still have a bunch in my crisper

4934790 these have been the hardest months of my career and my life but now they are the greatest the effort that came from our crew today is something i will never forget
4934791 i hope what i have done will show a lot of young people in britain that if you work enough you really can get your dream sometimes you sit by the side of the pool and think it is just too hard to go on but then you know that there are great rewards down the road if you persevere i certainly know that now
4934792 ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it i have ordered my men to arrest anyone carrying out looting and other criminal acts

4934808 one thing i noticed that day i saw more blue herons and groups of ducks than i have seen in that section in my 7 years with wwv
4934809 neenee niet dat ik dat niet wil worden maar dat was niet de reden nee
4934810 ik heb meegedaan uit nieuwsgierigheid ik had zoiets nog nooit meegemaakt ondanks het feit dat al veel mensen mij daartoe hadden aangespoord ik ga niet zeggen dat ik daar tegen ben maar het ligt niet in mijn aard er zijn zoveel meisjes die met hun valiesje van de ene verkiezing naar de andere trekken maar daar hoor ik dus zeker niet bij
4934811 dat trok me meer aan omdat ze een duidelijk doel heeft gent vertegenwoordigen vond ik een mooi idee en daarom heb ik toch meegedaan al heb ik altijd volgehouden dat het bij die ene keer zal blijven win or lose
4934812 mijn moeder heeft altijd heel veel belangstelling gehad voor bloemen we wonen b v in een huis met een heel grote tuin van thuis uit ben ik er dus wel mee vertrouwd anderzijds heb ik absoluut geen groene vingers ik probeer altijd planten op mijn kamer te houden maar ik luk er absoluut niet in ik heb dus hoegenaamd geen aanleg om bloemen te kweken wat ik wel van mijn moeder heb geleerd is de kunst van het bloemenschikken
4934813 hij is het die mij ertoe aangezet heeft van aan deze verkiezing deel te nemen
4934814 ik geloof zelfs dat hij er nu al een beetje spijt van heeft nee zijn nichtje en een vriendin van zijn broer nemen vaak aan dergelijke verkiezingen deel en zij zeiden als wij dat kunnen kun jij dat toch ook ik ging wel eens mee om een beetje te helpen en om te kijken natuurlijk maar ik weigerde mee te doen tot zijn mama mijn toekomstige schoonmama dus ter ore kwam dat die meisjes altijd opnieuw werden uitgenodigd om aan verkiezingen deel te nemen zij heeft uiteindelijk de doorslag gegeven ikzelf denk altijd honderd keer na vooraleer ik iets doe en daardoor ben ik soms bang om aan iets te beginnen daarom heb ik uiteindelijk toch toegegeven omdat ik mezelf eens op de proef wou stellen hoeveel zenuwen heb ik hoe breng ik het ervan af hij is dus wel blij dat ik gewonnen heb maar ondertussen heeft hij contact gehad met de vriend van antonia de vorige bloemenkoningin en die jongen zegt ook voor h r is het een mooi jaar geweest maar al mocht ik ook wel naar vele plaatsen meegaan je staat natuurlijk voortdurend op het tweede plan
4934815 nee zeker niet integendeel ik vond het heel mooi van antonia dat ze in haar afscheidsrede haar vriend heeft bedankt omdat naar het schijnt inderdaad veel relaties stuk lopen op zon verkiezing ik hoop echt dat ik op het einde van het jaar juist hetzelfde kan zeggen ik denk het wel ik ben er eigenlijk zelfs van overtuigd
4934816 dat is zon beetje een hangend probleem we begonnen inderdaad reeds stilaan over trouwen te spreken dat het zo lang heeft geduurd heeft natuurlijk weer met mijn terughoudendheid te maken naast onze studies en het zoeken naar werk nu was zowat het moment aangebroken maar nu weet ik het weer niet meer natuurlijk het zal ervan afhangen hoe druk ik het heb
4934817 in het reglement staat dat je op het moment van de verkiezing niet getrouwd mag zijn ik denk dat dit impliceert dat je wel mag trouwen als je al verkozen bent
4934818 ik hou meer van films met een inhoud psychologische dramas b v daar kan ik me echt in verkneukelen probleemfilms met ingewikkelde toestanden heerlijk
4934819 oh daar durf ik niet aan denken de fotografe moedigt haar aan the camera loves you zegt ze ik zou niet terughoudend zijn hoor maar ik laat het liever aan andere mensen over om daarover te oordelen
4934820 alhoewel ze naar het schijnt in haar priv leven geen gemakkelijke is heb ik nogal bewondering voor catherine deneuve zon koele verschijning dat ligt me wel bij haar heb je nooit de indruk dat er een regisseur achter de camera heeft gestaan die haar volledig naar zijn hand heeft gezet haar persoonlijkheid is altijd sterk genoeg en zo iemand zou ik ook wel willen zijn geen pop aan een touwtje dan nog liever een rol met een slecht karakter
4934821 toen ik jonger was heb ik zelf heel wat po zie geschreven literatuurontleding was op school mijn lievelingsvak alhoewel de meesten dat verafschuwden ik vond het wel spijtig dat we een iets oudere conservatieve leerkracht nederlands hadden als zij gedichten uitlegde vroeg ik me soms af of de dichter dat wel zo bedoeld had ik heb dat ook met mijn eigen gedichten ondervonden de mensen gaan daar vanalles achter zoeken
4934822 nee thuis heb ik voornamelijk verzamelalbums en het is dan zo moeilijk om er iemand uit te pikken de meeste dichters veranderen trouwens zelf voortdurend van strekking en telkens als je dan denkt iemand te hebben ontdekt dan kom je later wel andere gedichten tegen die je dan tegenvallen
4934823 absoluut wil je een paar tips het italiaans restaurant op het sint annaplein daar moet je het degustatiemenu eens proberen schitterend en wat minder bekend maar waar ikzelf zeer tevreden over ben is het restaurant in de promenadegalerij op de brabantdam met uitkijk op de leie een stemmig kader met pianobegeleiding en wat caf s betreft mijn lievelingscaf is het druppelkot
4934824 nee want je wordt dat gewoon na een tijd ik ben daar nog nooit dronken buitengegaan ook van het bierhuis daarnaast de hopduvel en t veloke in het patershol hou ik allemaal typisch gentse caf s vind ik
4934825 in het uitgaansleven niet zo veel meer toch niet s nachts als je dat bedoelt ik weet wel waar the places to be zich bevinden zo goed ken ik gent wel maar cultureel en historisch ben ik toch meer op de hoogte denk ik het liefste ga ik naar typische plaatsen zoals het patershol de lawaaierige dancings en zo die hebben we reeds achter ons gelaten we gaan naar rustiger oorden
4934826 im a poor lonesome cowboy im a long way from home
4934827 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4934828 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4934829 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4934830 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4934831 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4934832 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4934833 then i would favour a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4934834 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4934835 a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country
4934836 the acceleration of russias ongoing effort to increase its influence
4934837 when there are russian populations linked to russia then those territories could break away so if ukraine insists on joining nato part of its territory could split away
4934838 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4934839 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4934840 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4934841 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4934842 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4934843 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4934844 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4934845 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands

4934861 there was a brief five year period when we could get away with treating russia like jamaica thats over now we have to deal with them like grown ups who have more nuclear weapons than anybody except us

4934870 het is als een mond waar de tong uit gesneden is het maakt niet uit hoever de mond open staat want je hoort toch alleen maar wat onduidelijke geluiden
4934871 misschien was het overkill geweest om de vlam aan te laten steken door een kind dat wees is geworden tijdens de aardbeving maar waarom was er geen minuut stilte voor het openen van de spelen om de slachtoffers te herdenken bijna 100 duizend mensen hebben drie maanden geleden het leven verloren verdienen zij geen minuut stilte is het tonen van rouw tijdens de olympische spelen iets waar china zich voor schaamt
4934872 everything was accomplished doing all best times winning every race everything that we wanted to do here has been accomplished
4934873 im taking control now this is in my power not yours
4934874 theres no lightning so we can rule that one out
4934875 it shows great disrespect for nature that someone would start a fire
4934876 you walked out the door and you could just hear it crackling
4934877 the trails and fire roads will still be open but there are a couple very bad scars on the mountain now to go with the previous fires that have taken place
4934878 we are here to serve notice on the so called nuclear renaissance that the anti nuclear movement is alive and well

4934882 you know god bless him bless his heart president of the united states a total failure losing all credibility with the american people on the economy on the war on energy you name the subject
4934883 challenging congress when we are trying to sweep up after his mess over and over and over again
4934884 nancy pelosi democratic party speaker of the house the third most powerful politician in the united states is up on the podium doing her best to damp down the mounting criticism of the democratic partys shameful collaboration in funding the war and aiding and abetting the bush administrations shredding of the constitution
4934885 to the regret of many this is not an impeachment hearing
4934886 the point was to change washington dc but instead washington dc changed nancy pelosi
4934887 we are glad she is taking on speaker pelosi who has been a huge disappointment even to her democratic party base
4934888 we admire sheehans bravery in standing up to the corrupt two party system she has suffered immeasurable loss because of the unwillingness of our government to stand up for justice
4934889 greens like sheehan have endorsed the impeachment of pres george bush vice president dick cheney and other bush administration officials sheehan also comes from working class roots which compares favorably to the green partys strong social justice platform
4934890 a blind gentleman came in off the street and gave us his stimulus check 637 00 everyday folks send us very small donations saying they wished they could give more
4934891 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4934892 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4934893 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4934894 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4934895 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4934896 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4934897 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months

4934905 we dropped a little bit of ball but so did they
4934906 throughout the year particularly earlier in the year if we had have done that we would have had a try scored against us but tonight it goes to show the difference in attitude between now and then
4934907 it was pretty important before halftime because i thought we were struggling a bit
4934908 halftime was pretty good for us but having said that i still thought the majority of the game we controlled things reasonably well
4934909 i think we have plenty of steam in our outside backs and im sure they would look forward to some dry footy but it doesnt worry us at the moment
4934910 it was a poor game and the skill level was low
4934911 they gave us the opportunity in the first 20 minutes of the second half and we werent good enough to take it
4934912 im trying not to be upset its been a great experience
4934913 in the next four years the relay team is going to be phenomenal and next time well get them
4934914 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
4934915 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
4934916 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4934917 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4934918 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4934919 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4934920 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4934921 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4934922 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4934923 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
4934924 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
4934925 but im always glad when they have time for a chat
4934926 but now and then i do think wouldnt it be nice to walk into the kitchen and have a nice cup of tea waiting for me but no if i want one ill have to get it myself
4934927 when i saw i wasnt covered i was just happy i was always the fastest i told you all i was going to be number one and i did just that
4934928 i wasnt really worried about racing fast my only aim was to be a champion
4934929 i was getting good starts all the way to the final i was getting better and better it was crazy phenomenal
4934930 this invasion of russia was not about south ossetia at all because i have to remind you what about abkhazia did anything happen there did we do anything as russia claims when they cleansed the whole upper abkhazia of the people and invaded it brutally the what about other places in georgia what about hitting the pipelines with ss 21 missiles what about you know damaging civilian infrastructures all around the country this was never about south ossetia this was brutal invasion of georgia with sole purpose and they clearly stated it to madame secretary to president sarkozy the overthrow of the georgian government and turning georgia into a failed state and basically implying ending its independence period and its not about our operation in south ossetia in south ossetia we had we exercised self defense against hundreds of invading russian tanks and against russian backed so called local separatists that were for the first time in first place russian officials almost all of them and we had only two choices a to surrender immediately and to let them in or to try to resist and to inflict damage on them and to deter them and any responsible democracy has no choice in such situation unfortunately as inequal as our forces are because the level of invasion in first days into georgia was higher than that was afghanistan and todays anniversary of prague and then bigger initiative than that into czechoslovakia in 1968 this is anniversary of prague russians are historically it looks like doing bad things in august when everybody else everybody civilized decision makers go for vacations and you know what its always about something maybe i would like the world should ask the questions when russians destroyed yukos when putin destroyed yukos nobody said anything then they start to say oh russia has nice investment environment because everybody has his own interest when russia went after international when russian agents poisoned president of ukraine ask ukrainians they have all the proof and evidence look at the face of president yushchenko did any of big decision makers do or say anything about that not talking about russian agents that were killed in london and they carried out basically nuclear attack on downtown of london well you know thats almost natural comes as natural right to russian leadership because if they can poison president of ukraine what about their own agents why not how many different forms of polonium they can send to the world now its cluster bombs killing my children and women here and by the way your colleagues foreign journalists how many more things can these barbarians do these cold blooded killers do for the world not to blame the victims can you say that you know the victim of rape is to be blamed for the rape because she wore a short skirt or the victim of you know killing be blamed for the killing because he provoked the killer with you know some strange look in his eyes thats exactly what some of the people were trying to do now toward georgia for the last several days excuse me but thats exactly the guarantee that it will happen over and over and over again because the people with you are dealing with whom you are dealing they are all about for them lying is instrument of communication bullying and blackmailing is the best things they enjoy and the only thing they understand its unity and strength of international community nothing else can deter and stop them because otherwise they are like they will stop keep advancing they will keep killing they will keep destroying other countries thats what they are trying to do to my country right now as we speak

4934932 weve been doing this for four years said former greensboro jaycees president randy harris standing at the tournament entrance to greet arriving spectators
4934933 we have never seen crowds like this at one time it was shoulder to shoulder we have even worked up a sweat for the first time
4934934 its a lot more convenient for me said spectator rick poston of winston salem who would have had to drive 12 more miles to reach forest oaks on the opposite side of guilford county
4934935 i think the triad has taken hold here we have em here from high point burlington and winston salem we arent used to that
4934936 i didnt think i would do it this year because it was so slow last year
4934937 is a great sign of things to come for this tournament
4934938 overtreated why too much medicine is making us sicker and poorer
4934939 so not only are we paying for stuff that we dont know whether it works or not we know were paying for stuff that causes harm
4934940 you might or might not reduce your risk of dying prematurely from cancer but its at the expense of not being able to have sex and having to wear diapers
4934941 when we say this drug lowers blood pressure or lowers cholesterol we think therefore it must reduce heart attacks
4934942 worried sick a prescription for health in an overtreated america
4934943 say a breast cancer specialist comes up with a method of treating it and runs around the country telling other breast cancer specialists
4934944 pretty soon everybody is doing it and nobody has tested it
4934945 right now theyre focused on blockbuster drugs drugs that sell 1 billion a year
4934946 dont have to have a specific technique taught to them to figure out if theres a change
4934947 what we see in reality is that women who come in with something werent doing a specific breast exam
4934948 they were showering and felt something dressing and felt something its just a part of the activities of daily living
4934949 the industry is screaming this means we have to do more studies
4934950 one of the goals of treating diabetes is that you have to deal with the complications
4934951 reward talking to patients and thoughtfulness and the do you really need this kind of questioning
4934952 its basically the idea of finding out what works what doesnt and for which patients
4934953 this is nothing personal you have to understand our point well if you still want to move in we wont be seeing anything but our official statement is that we dont allow it
4934954 dont listen to the house owner they have no right to keep you from moving into the flat
4934955 i dont understand how any part of it is their sacrifice
4934956 but ask them if they would want it in their backyard
4934957 but not to alter the aesthetic of lindley park and sunset hills
4934958 i dont want to be in the business of destroying viable single family neighborhoods
4934959 were just hoping theres some way to connect the dots between our downtown and the interstate
4934960 i think it can really bring some services and businesses that arent there that could help economic development
4934961 i really had a vision here and im too stubborn and too foolish to quit
4934962 we just wish a amp t would come on and take it over
4934963 in the end our university has a responsibility to make not just the community in the university positive but have a positive impact on the community outside the university
4934964 just like those fine houses around uncg i intend to stay here and be around them
4934965 theres no question they have a responsibility to the city and the city has a responsibility to facilitate that
4934966 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4934967 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4934968 the near 100 degree hot dry weather and difficult terrain continues to impede progress
4934969 firefighters are holding up well in the heat and terrain the team has backed off to contingency roads to prepare for a stand
4934970 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
4934971 i started noticing there was an artistic element to it
4934972 that was one of the things that made it exciting for me
4934973 i think he can take an ordinary image and make it unique
4934974 i really have not done justice to the local region
4934975 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4934976 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4934977 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4934978 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
4934979 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
4934980 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4934981 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4934982 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4934983 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4934984 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4934985 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4934986 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4934987 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4934988 i dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite
4934989 the right hand of the lord has triumphed the right hand of the lord is exalted the right hand of the lord has triumphed
4934990 this is the gate of the lord he who is righteous may enter
4934991 you are my god and i will thank you you are my god and i will exalt you
4934992 how can you say i love you when your heart is not with me you have mocked me three times now and have not told me what makes your strength so great
4934993 a razor has never come upon my head for i have been a nazirite to god from my mothers womb if my head were shaved then my strength would leave me i would become weak and be like anyone else
4934994 this time come up for he has told his whole secret to me
4934995 i will go out as at other times and shake myself free
4934996 our god has given samson our enemy into our hand
4934997 our god has given our enemy into our hand the ravager of our country who has killed many of us
4934998 let me feel the pillars on which the house rests so that i may lean against them
4934999 lord god remember me and strengthen me only this once o god so that with this one act of revenge i may pay back the philistines for my two eyes
4935000 any charge must be sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses
4935001 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
4935002 were a film friendly community we have fabulous locations all kinds of different looks
4935003 we have some swampy areas in the region we have mountains and flatlands and cities we have big city looks we have beautiful and quaint small towns and we have crew here they dont have to bring everybody in from l a
4935004 there isnt a door she can knock on and not expect to see a smile on someones face in 60 seconds
4935005 i remember when we were shooting wed see a location we wanted to use and wed have her knock on the door while we hid behind a tree and you could tell just by the body language that theyd be talking about some recipe or a relative or shed be petting their dog she was very helpful in interacting with the community
4935006 once i got out of school i really didnt know what i wanted to make a living at

4935008 you cant have a thin skin or be easily offended to be in this job thats for sure
4935009 but generally speaking people are very nice you have to be you have to be outgoing and cordial or otherwise youre not going to get very much done
4935010 she has magnificent interpersonal skills and shes able to promote the region to folks who most people would be tongue tied around or would swoon over
4935011 rebecca has the ability to articulate in a professional way and interact with those folks in a very very effective way
4935012 but instead of trying to recruit a manufacturing plant here what im doing is recruiting production companies who might hire a pool of 200 people people that live here that rely on freelance opportunities working in feature films and in commercials for their livelihoods and those production companies are spending money here on leatherheads they spent about 7 million here in the piedmont triad alone they didnt even film the whole movie here they only filmed here a couple of weeks
4935013 what rebecca and her team are doing and in all fairness what people across the state are doing is exactly where we should be headed to transition from what has been traditionally a manufacturing economy
4935014 you have crews here theyre spending money theyre staying in hotels theyre eating
4935015 the girls in the office heard a story that george clooney was in salisbury did you meet him

4935028 no problem just as long as you do it the next time youre here because somebody did it for me too
4935029 contrary to the public interest because people want to know whats happening in grenada
4935030 everybody knows if the press is going to be financially threatened that it is a more effective way to impose censorship
4935031 i wanted to see how charlie would handle a game going with our first string guys and then coming out after halftime and all the things you have to do
4935032 i settled down a lot more as the game went on

4935054 if there was an eighth wonder of the world food and wine peking duck and pinot noir has to be it because youve got the savory character of the peking duck and youve got the peat in the pinot noirs which if theyre made properly have got this surrounding savory character of just a touch of fruit in the middle palate
4935055 well you know its been a long time since ive had that i can tell you but sweet and sour pork is a casual dish its to think too much about hey have a nice inexpensive
4935056 because the rich brown sauce of the chicken feet is really quite rich and flavorsome
4935057 we understand that they like a softer styled wine with less harsh tannins and maybe a bit more fruit character
4935058 we dont want to change peking duck into a duck hamburger or something like that and its the same thing with wine its um youre plugging into a culture that goes back thousands of years
4935059 part of ones despair of course is that the world cares nothing for the little shocks endured by the sensitive stickler while we look in horror at a badly punctuated sign the world carries on around us blind to our plight we are like the little boy in the sixth sense who can see dead people except that we can see dead punctuation
4935060 florida is for sale has been for a while now and it makes me sad as hell ill stay as long as i can but one day soon it will all go the marsh wrens and the butterflies the cactus and blackberry vines the old cracker house the feeling and i wonder if the hawk should ever come back just on a random flyover one day singing its high sweet whistle way up in the sky if anyone here where this dirt street once was will even remember the kind of bird he is or care enough to stop just for a moment and smile
4935061 it was nice to hit the home run but after making the error in the ninth i was just glad i had another at bat to make up for it

4935063 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
4935064 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4935065 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information

4935097 what i wanted was for them to put their guns away and check on my children say im sorry show some type of concern and i didnt get that which is the reason i contacted a lawyer

4935106 the men are just much more comfortable than the women
4935107 women sometimes take overly conservative positions and sometimes then they dont make as much money as men
4935108 its true that most men are willing to take more risks than women
4935109 the battle between greed and fear is involved in all investing
4935110 there is a little more greed in the guys and a little more fear in the girls
4935111 a hedge fund is like a mutual fund on steroids
4935112 its like the barry bonds of investments barry goes to mexico for his juice we go to the cayman islands
4935113 when things are bad particularly like they are now we seem to be a good scapegoat for absolutely everything
4935114 thats whats neat about the whole hedge fund manager routine that im doing because there are so many misunderstandings
4935115 people say if you tell jokes dont do it when youre not used to ending up with a lot of dead air
4935116 once youve succeeded at one field you want to succeed at the most difficult job there is getting on the stage and making people laugh

4935125 the majors had been going the other way early on in this process they were exiting the u s and looking for larger particularly oil reserves outside of the u s in the international arena
4935126 they have shown a lot more interest in re establishing foundations back in north america where the prices have been good and the economics are sound
4935127 they were the operators that came in took the risk acquired the leases developed and pushed the technologies to be able to drill and produce effectively the giant unconventional resources here in the rockies
4935128 the nature of our business is shifting from independent operators to large major corporations
4935129 that acreage we acquired was the first production for conocophillips in that area
4935130 weve projected that well drill as many as 815 wells
4935131 this just underscores what weve been saying all along which is contrary to industry threats oil and gas companies are investing heavily in colorado
4935132 updating common sense rules to provide greater protections for our drinking water and for public health and wildlife isnt going to change that
4935133 the proposed rules if adopted will negatively impact chevrons investment in colorado
4935134 the art galleries of paris contain the finest collection of frames i ever saw
4935135 we saw it a lot back in the 80s when there were assumable loans

4935139 there is some fear the commodities complex is selling off because of a global economic slowdown
4935140 but for now well continue to celebrate cheaper oil and the stronger dollar
4935141 we counsel our clients that they will not face a more challenging negotiation than they will with the broe company

4935155 most are remaining at the home school and taking advantage of supplemental educational services and other interventions provided at the home school
4935156 we had not a good relationship but a great relationship
4935157 perhaps no better example is representative james t walsh a 10 term republican from new york who announced in january that he would retire when his term expired mr walsh has a key role over appropriations and is a fixture in his syracuse area district making him a formidable candidate to challenge but with mr walsh out of the way democrats appear to be in a strong position to pick up his seat in part because of the fund raising advantage held by dan maffei the democratic candidate mr maffei who lost to mr walsh by about 3 400 votes in 2006 has nearly 1 million in his campaign account compared with nearly 110 000 raised by his republican opponent dale sweetland a former county legislator
4935158 energy independence is not realistic im not sure its even desirable
4935159 we usually put our health and well being on the back burner to make sure that our families are taken care of
4935160 so i really appreciate an event that is catered to us because there isnt enough stuff out there for women
4935161 my sister is always telling me to take care of myself so i decided to come out this year
4935162 im enjoying everything here and im getting a lot of information its great for us to have all of this in one place
4935163 weve been getting funding cuts for a number of years
4935164 funding in washington the violence against women act money those funds have been cut each year and now its starting to mount up
4935165 im expecting the committee to bring it before the whole council and amend the budget

4935169 i have the utmost respect and feel this county council is going to step in and do what they need to do
4935170 the fact of the matter is four days after he sent me the letter saying we should engage in some debates he got a hand delivered letter from us saying absolutely
4935171 absolutely received a letter from the sweetland campaign back in july and since then weve been waiting for a conversation to have to talk about debates
4935172 theyre critical to this race and we want to have them and we want to have the conversation so people can hear where the candidates stand on the issues
4935173 i dont know what kind of political ploy dan wants to play but you know lets go
4935174 we pretended to be the thundercats and he would always be the one running fast that was his whole thing hes always been competitive
4935175 he told me whenever he hears them cheering for liu xiang his main competitor he imagines that its his name theyre cheering he wants to win for his family and for the gamecocks
4935176 as far as we know there are not any here in georgia yet
4935177 well sir i was strolling down riverwalk the other day and this gentleman approached me and identified himself as a freelance pharmaceutical representative and asked me if i was interested in a sample from his briefcase which i reluctantly took but only after i had remitted 20 in payment at which point he presented me with this bonus card and told me it was good for unlimited free rides on augusta transit buses
4935178 the ethical quandaries of the free ride were spotlighted this week by the disclosure of a computer glitch that allowed hundreds of people to get free tickets and metrocards most of them unwittingly from vending machines in long island rail road and metro north railroad stations
4935179 selling a swipe on a metrocard is illegal and can get you arrested bending a metrocards magnetic strip to fool the turnstile into letting you through is also a form of theft
4935180 a federal judge in boston this morning let stand for now a temporary restraining order that a separate judge had issued last saturday against three mit students to bar them from discussing security vulnerabilities in the boston subway systems payment tickets and cards

4935182 what happened to the korean war oh now i remember that was the forgotten war
4935183 as chapter commander of the local korean war veterans association chapter and department commander of the department of south carolina i must remind you that we lost a lot of men in korea
4935184 go down to broad and fourth streets and look at our korean war memorial
4935185 it has to be dealt with because it hurts business it hurts people and it hurts the business that these companies are doing
4935186 small business cant absorb the rising costs as well as big business can
4935187 a really vibrant community will see that big businesses and universities and colleges are spinning off a lot of little businesses like retail small manufacturing and boutique firms thats how an economy really gets going
4935188 the issue set and the audience were decidedly different a couple of hours later when maffei went to the mostly black southside neighborhood for a roundtable with local residents and business owners at a community resource center
4935189 the southside of syracuse is a place of endless potential that has so far at least in the last several decades been unrealized
4935190 maffei told the group of about 20 at the southside community resource center that if elected he will push for changes in the federal empowerment zone tax credit to make it more beneficial for syracuse businesses
4935191 a democrat hoping to replace republican congressman james walsh after this novembers elections says he wants input on how to turn the local economy around dan maffei is launching a series of meetings to discuss economic development maffei met with community members on tuesday on syracuses southside an area ravaged by high unemployment and business closings he says there is a chance to turn things around
4935192 there could be a dramatic political realignment in the northeast if republicans dont head it off right now
4935193 the exclamation point on this years congressional elections is that republicans dont have a competitive candidate on staten island
4935194 the staten island republican party has been renowned for producing powerful politicians for years for decades
4935195 we let the children pick what they want to show
4935196 each week we put up things as they finished it
4935197 the wood stork has been on the endangered species list since february 1984
4935198 i speak from my heart im very passionate about this

4935200 its a big celebration we do it to let customers know we appreciate them
4935201 we signed the papers on a friday i had never worked in a restaurant in my life
4935202 i wanted to get kids out and harvest and talk a little about biodiversity
4935203 do you know how to tell if watermelon is ripe
4935204 its only ripe if the vine that attaches to it starts dying
4935205 i like this place but i never knew it was here
4935206 seeing the photos and hearing the stories help to remind us of the big impact that our pets have on our lives
4935207 there is nothing more rewarding in our work than to hear the great stories from the wonderful people who have adopted pets from the spca
4935208 the goal is to have this be my full time job and make enough to live
4935209 buying businesses for themselves moving west or to europe including russia or to dubai
4935210 theyre also moving totally outside what they do buying a retail store or a ranch
4935211 the job market is in the worst most chaotic state ive ever seen it in fixed income
4935212 ive been doing this for over 30 years and ive never seen anything like this
4935213 the structured finance market is so bleak right now it makes sense for us to focus our energies on this
4935214 its refreshing to not have to worry about whether i am going to have a job next week

4935218 the thing i tell most folks is the first place they need to go is to their lender
4935219 if it were up to me i would buy one a week until the prices started significantly turning around
4935220 quite a few of these are sales to investors who are renting out the homes to foreclosure victims
4935221 they can buy a home for under 90 000 have a payment of about 550 650 with taxes and insurance and rent it almost immediately for 900 to 1 100 per month
4935222 the goal will be to have the local government buy the property and keep the family in there
4935223 i think its going to make it more difficult for investors if local governments are going in and offering 60 cents on the dollar
4935224 people are really banking on future appreciation as the market corrects
4935225 prices have collapsed 40 to 50 percent sometimes 60 percent
4935226 every single closing ive had the banks have lost between 60 000 to 80 000
4935227 were seeing multiple offers on many of them and theyre bidding up over the asking price that will help to increase prices and stabilize the market
4935228 the rules have tightened down so much that theyve made us investors into what seems to be a high risk borrower
4935229 the reality is were not there are other ways to do it but its really hard to get conventional financing right now
4935230 in less than an hours drive you can experience seven of colorados beautiful state parks
4935231 this is an athletic event but the most important aspect is thousands of people connecting through a common bond organ donation
4935232 but athletic ability is not a requirement to participate in fact many participants come just for the camaraderie
4935233 we won the baby boomer jackpot we spend summers here and then we travel and go back to our house in arizona in october until the next camping season
4935234 if ownership of the property is transferred without the lenders consent depending on the circumstances the entire loan can be called due
4935235 wells fargo cant comment on whether this property transaction was proper because we had no knowledge of the transfer however had we been contacted we probably would not have consented

4935237 i thank the lord every day that i have these things i may have an empty house when im done but ill have some money in the bank to start over

4935243 misschien was het overkill geweest om de vlam aan te laten steken door een kind dat wees is geworden tijdens de aardbeving maar waarom was er geen minuut stilte voor het openen van de spelen om de slachtoffers te herdenken bijna 100 duizend mensen hebben drie maanden geleden het leven verloren verdienen zij geen minuut stilte is het tonen van rouw tijdens de olympische spelen iets waar china zich voor schaamt
4935244 it is critical that unions and businesses work together like cwa ibew did with verizon to not only keep jobs here but expand employment opportunities in the area
4935245 i am conducting these roundtable meetings throughout the district to listen to concerns and ideas from local business owners on how to make these programs work for central and upstate new york
4935246 we need to discuss ideas on what we can do as a community not only to bring new jobs to the region but also to help existing businesses grow expand and protect their employees
4935247 je nai jamais dit a alors que c tait crit 2 posts plus haut dans le topic
4935248 youve still got the growth side to worry about so its not full steam ahead for bonds
4935249 muni bonds are inexpensive today and when you layer on a potential greater demand over the next year or two its even more attractive today
4935250 in february we looked and said every municipal bond is going to go bad
4935251 i thought i was stupid and i acted as a stupid person
4935252 education was very much valued and reading was something they did a lot of watching television was something they did little of

4935254 i ran into peer pressure thats people who encourage errors rudeness and stupidity

4935257 we are grateful for these brave men and womens service are thankful to their families for their shared sacrifice the 174th fighter wings safe arrival home is a relief now we must work to bring the war in iraq to an end by drawing down our troop level in a timely and responsible manner the bush administrations poor planning has stretched our service men and women reservists and their families to the breaking point it is past time to bring them all home for good
4935258 the metropolitan development association today announced 225 000 in grants to support research projects by three upstate companies and their university partners the products have the potential to create 17 jobs and generate 14 3 million in new revenue for the companies the association said the money for the grants for growth is coming from a 1 million state grant secured by state sen john defrancisco r syracuse
4935259 at a time when americans are paying 4 a gallon gas and areas like central and upstate new york are hemorrhaging jobs this news is particularly galling the bush administration told us at the beginning of this war that reconstruction would be paid for by iraq through oil revenue we need to help the iraqi people get back on their feet but we also have pressing needs here at home
4935260 i refuse to believe every option for speeding up progress on the new centro hub has been exhausted instead of exclusively focusing all our energies on arguing about drilling for more oil we need to discuss alternative energy and alternative transportation options that will decrease our dependence on oil
4935261 increasing big oils already record setting profits wont help consumers at the pump and drilling in anwr wont produce a single barrel of oil for a decade we have to do more now to diversify where we get our energy like investing in natural gas solar and wind and finally break our addiction to oil
4935262 unfortunately congress is gridlocked and will now recess for five weeks without passing anything to help real people deal with the suffocating gas prices when i get to congress i will move beyond partisanship and produce some real results for americans
4935263 i think i just fell on it just precautionary stuff

4935287 bob said to her ill buy your broasted chicken stand if charlie buys it with me so i did and he gave me the name chicken charlie
4935288 i told my partner our chicken is phenomenal but i want to add a dessert thats when we came up with the deep fried twinkie the people went nuts i saw that america loves to eat that was the beginning

4935294 how i learned to stop worrying and learned to love stanley kubrick
4935295 cautions and pending yellow card suspensions from club competition matches expire at the end of the season
4935296 it is clear that we are on the brink of a major change that goes well beyond the end of another cycle of civilian military rule in pakistan
4935297 once we could count on our name to get elected
4935298 but not any longer people are demanding much more they are much less deferential
4935299 the guys who had a bicycle now have a motorbike those who had a motorbike have a car
4935300 they worry about paying the rent about losing their jobs but they are better off nonetheless
4935301 the pakistani army always has updated plans for a war in kashmir for an indian invasion and for taking control of government
4935302 we just dusted off the right file and it was over in hours
4935303 good pakistani muslims to fight washingtons wars against their own countrymen and co religionists
4935304 for the first time i am ashamed that my urdu is not better
4935305 the lawyers set things going but are not a political party so could not reap the true rewards of their actions
4935306 he has his finger on the popular pulse and the common man likes him
4935307 the winner of this crisis will be the democratic process in this country
4935308 the culture values and institutions have yet to be defined and refined but the democratic process will win
4935309 just governments must sometimes take the lives of unrepentant terrorist mass murderers in order to protect and uphold the infinite value of human life
4935310 well they may observe that but i dont have to
4935311 am i praying out of love for all my fellow jews or just those i happen to know about and agree with
4935312 twas the night of the geulah and in every single shtiebel sounds of the torah could be heard coming from every kind of yeedel
4935313 the time has come for my children to be freed
4935314 rouse the moshiach from his heavenly berth have him get in his chariot and head down to earth
4935315 i am the moshiach hashem has heard your plea your geulah has come its time to go free
4935316 just look at his hat at the pinches and brim
4935317 whoever heard of moshiach with a brim thats turned down
4935318 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
4935319 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
4935320 no difference to me what i wear on my head
4935321 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
4935322 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
4935323 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
4935324 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
4935325 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts
4935326 to each of you certain yidden seem too frum or too frei but all yidden are beloved in the aibishters eye

4935329 just a few years ago no one would listen when it came to organic products
4935330 now everyone is talking about it anything green is growing in double digits each year
4935331 its a good thing in terms of improving salaries overseas but you see it in the price
4935332 many of the retailers who were conservative earlier in the year ended up re ordering so more seem to be stocking up for the holidays
4935333 there is more stocking up of the bread and butter products this year
4935334 with gas prices the way they are it has more people thinking about staying home
4935335 the designers have to think about this a year or more ahead so they try to anticipate what might be popular
4935336 im thinking about so many different things that my head hurts and im very tired by the time i get home
4935337 you quickly learn to focus on just what youre looking for otherwise you can waste a lot of time listening to the pitches
4935338 i have heard other retailers say ship it whenever and that really scares me
4935339 i cant imagine not knowing and then having three or four bills all due at the same time that would really hurt our cash flow
4935340 i keep in mind what people can buy at macys and try to have something different
4935341 were really a cooking store and i want to have products that will make us unique
4935342 its my job as her rep to make sure she doesnt have a line thats similar to someone else in bellingham
4935343 if someone comes in and wants something vicki already has i let them know the product is already in that market usually they are respectful of that
4935344 its the hunt to find that new pattern or design that really makes this fun for me
4935345 many manufacturers are working a year ahead which makes it a challenge when it comes to colors and patterns
4935346 you want to have some fun things that will surprise some customers if it flies off the shelf you usually have time to order again
4935347 at pacific chef we have around 18 departments and each has its own budget ive been spending dollars out of each of the departments so tonight ill sit down and figure out whether i need to pull money out of one department and put into another
4935348 they asked me where are the boys i said my sons were away they took everything from my house turned it upside down and left
4935349 they wanted to know where my basement was i told them and said we have plenty of wine please take it they went to the basement shot it up and came back i was crying they said in russian
4935350 there were bodies everywhere i saw two dead women from my village lying on the ground everything was on fire
4935351 we were fighting to defend the people of south ossetia and i am proud of that
4935352 i want to complain about the one sided reporting from the west your reports are not correct they are not right the west has been reflecting only the georgian point of view
4935353 its perfectly obvious georgia of course and its not the first time either
4935354 this saakashvili bloke its clear hes just an american puppet
4935355 thats how i see it either hes sick or hes evil the way hes treated russia
4935356 i expect this to happen within a couple of days
4935357 i saw a soldier on the street i assumed he was georgian and asked him in georgian for a light he turned round and spoke in russian
4935358 the landscape is beautiful but we also have big mountains in dagestan
4935359 my husband died 14 years ago i wish id died soon after him i cant walk any more
4935360 my generation grew up during world war ii we were always crying it was a terrible situation
4935361 the idea is to punish georgia and the georgian government and misha saakashvili they hate misha
4935362 you cant be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4935363 russia has been all the time testing the reactions of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4935364 he looks like he wants to say something but he cant say it
4935365 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4935366 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4935367 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4935368 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4935369 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4935370 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4935371 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4935372 completely consistent with his record of supporting our allies in a very tough region of the world
4935373 hes been a leader on this issue for a very long time
4935374 this little country was prospering its a democracy its a freely elected government
4935375 what were seeing now is a gross violation of everything we stand for and believe in
4935376 but this one is really brazen theres been an exchange of money when hes been advising mccain to take some action
4935377 you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows

4935380 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4935381 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4935382 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4935383 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4935384 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4935385 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4935386 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4935387 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4935388 every single radio station that we gave handlebars to their initial reaction was oh hell no
4935389 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4935390 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4935391 its been such an unbelievable roller coaster its been such an unbelievable ride
4935392 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
4935393 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional
4935394 ali i want to do is go see my mom
4935395 to be honest i was thinking dont blow the lead
4935396 it seems we dont find out until they walk in the hospital door
4935397 if i as the mayor cross the border it takes me a lot longer than its taking some of these wounded folks clearly some deals have been made at a higher level of government and we didnt know about them
4935398 if i got shot down there do you think id get this kind of an escort id be lucky to come back in a garbage truck
4935399 we dont know whether some of the people being brought here are bad guys or good guys but the history south of the border is that these people hit men will go to the hospital to finish the job if they need to were not equipped to deal with threats like that
4935400 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4935401 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4935402 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4935403 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4935404 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4935405 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4935406 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4935407 it was final preparations were being put in place for a year beforehand
4935408 these are the most romantic people in the world theyre very gallant in the stupid sense
4935409 do they really listen theyre very much the charge of the light brigade people it has a lot to do with personal honor
4935410 everyone was expecting that something would happen because of saakashvilis western ways
4935411 the people who know anything about the vice presidential process on our campaign are not talking about it
4935412 it has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds
4935413 the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism healthcare energy
4935414 they want to send a message to the business community that theyre going to play hardball on this
4935415 we have a pretty rickety national economy and what we need to do is come together
4935416 its fair to say that colorado will be the center of ballot initiative world in november
4935417 the business labor ones likely will be the biggest most bitter and hard fought ballot fight in the country
4935418 coloradans appreciate and love their freedoms and thats the main thrust of amendment 47
4935419 if people break the law they should be held responsible
4935420 this isnt the focus what most das are doing today
4935421 youre not making colorado a very attractive place to do business
4935422 shards of the russian soul might have lodged themselves within her unwilling to be removed

4935425 strategically its important for the campaigns to be able to say someone is strong or weak it can undercut or increase their ability to raise money
4935426 but its like reading tea leaves maybe there is more at stake this year i think the big thing on both sides is whether rossi will get more money if he beats expectations
4935427 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
4935428 even death bitches say hi to me she tell her blind friends and she say i gotta see
4935429 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
4935430 whoo is it hard in here or is it just me
4935431 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4935432 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4935433 we want the public to know that hunting is allowed on dnr land and we want all our user groups to be safe while theyre using capitol forest

4935439 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense

4935441 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4935442 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4935443 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4935444 what i traced this to is a certain selfishness on my part
4935445 i was so obsessed with me and you know the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
4935446 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4935447 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
4935448 some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
4935449 you know if youve got book sales of 25 million
4935450 theyre going to make a good decision and were going to be able to solve the big problems that we face
4935451 i dont want them to fall when youre competing as a team every score counts you dont want to miss because you get blamed for it
4935452 i feel like im very lucky to be at the top
4935453 they became injured and thats it that was their career
4935454 its very fun to watch elite gymnastics but you need to see how they train
4935455 i was the only kid that they picked from the day care
4935456 the coach asked me to jump and he said that i was flexible and strong
4935457 the hardest thing is mentally you have to challenge yourself every day
4935458 i had back and knee injuries and you have to keep going youve got to really try

4935470 its just one game more but we did have this one circled
4935471 they are the world champs id be lying if i said we didnt have it circled
4935472 we want to make it hard on the other team
4935473 we can get a good shot any time down the floor
4935474 i said after the first couple of games that those shots were going to fall
4935475 when we create the tempo of the game defensively like that and then shoot this way we have a good chance to win
4935476 he might be the best transition player in the tournament
4935477 im a much better player now i was too young then i had never been in the playoffs and i had never really been in any big nba games
4935478 something i dreamed about since i started swimming was to win an olympic gold medal
4935479 im doing it because i love what i do if bob bowman his coach and i did it for money wed be in different sports
4935480 i saw so many quotes saying that it was impossible to duplicate it that it wont happen

4935485 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4935486 a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country
4935487 the acceleration of russias ongoing effort to increase its influence
4935488 when there are russian populations linked to russia then those territories could break away so if ukraine insists on joining nato part of its territory could split away

4935494 he still feels some pain in the heel after training
4935495 something is wrong with his heel bone membrane which makes him feel some pain or discomfort in training

4935498 they clearly drew a bright line separating themselves on some issues
4935499 but what was distinct here was they did it without smashing each other
4935500 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that but there are ways that we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
4935501 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
4935502 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4935503 you do everything you can to get that decision right
4935504 all those questions surrounding the war have been very difficult for me
4935505 the warrens give away 90 percent of their income through three charities acts of mercy which serves people with aids equipping leaders which trains leaders in developing countries and the global p e a c e fund which fights poverty disease corruption and illiteracy using local congregations
4935506 americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4935507 i think that americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4935508 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
4935509 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4935510 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family youre middle class i would argue if youre making more than 250 000 then youre in the top 3 or 4 percent in this country youre doing well under the approach im taking if youre making 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut
4935511 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth i dont want to raise anybodys taxes

4935515 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4935516 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4935517 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4935518 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4935519 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4935520 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4935521 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months
4935522 we dropped a little bit of ball but so did they
4935523 throughout the year particularly earlier in the year if we had have done that we would have had a try scored against us but tonight it goes to show the difference in attitude between now and then
4935524 it was pretty important before halftime because i thought we were struggling a bit
4935525 halftime was pretty good for us but having said that i still thought the majority of the game we controlled things reasonably well
4935526 i think we have plenty of steam in our outside backs and im sure they would look forward to some dry footy but it doesnt worry us at the moment
4935527 it was a poor game and the skill level was low
4935528 they gave us the opportunity in the first 20 minutes of the second half and we werent good enough to take it
4935529 she takes me to hospital and to see the doctor it would be impossible for me to get to these places if she didnt take me and i really appreciate that
4935530 i go to the gym for a couple of hours once a week
4935531 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4935532 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4935533 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4935534 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4935535 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4935536 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4935537 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4935538 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now
4935539 my wife who had to go out to work because we didnt have much money did all the washing cooking and cleaning as well like all blokes do i took that for granted only now do i appreciate the work she did
4935540 but im always glad when they have time for a chat
4935541 but now and then i do think wouldnt it be nice to walk into the kitchen and have a nice cup of tea waiting for me but no if i want one ill have to get it myself
4935542 bracing for armageddon the science and politics of bioterrorism in america
4935543 once again people are closing their eyes to the reality and creating myths i did not make a strong statement because i refuse to accept this widespread simplified interpretation which paints the georgians as the victims and the russians as the villains that is a gross oversimplification of the situation and i would have to write a lengthy article to explain why i do not share this view
4935544 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information

4935551 she said it could be a friend not necessarily a significant other
4935552 when someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible
4935553 when you put your mind to a certain thing it can happen the biggest thing is nothing is impossible all it takes is an imagination
4935554 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4935555 i really wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
4935556 everyone on the planet is trying to make him work giving him obstacles

4935562 the cranes saw dales fields as a great pit stop to fuel up for the continuing journey to their breeding grounds they would hunt and peck for days at the grains and stalks left over from the previous falls harvest
4935563 it seemed to be an obligatory stop for them on their spring migration north with many stopping again on their way back in the fall
4935564 the cranes became dales surrogate family dale was quite content living by himself but i think the cranes gave him a comfortable feeling of being needed he enjoyed looking forward to their yearly visits like old friends and relatives returning to visit for a spell
4935565 i always knew saunders was pretty affectionate toward the cranes

4935569 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4935570 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4935571 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4935572 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4935573 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4935574 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4935575 as long as were at the table were going to keep pursuing that
4935576 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
4935577 boeing has been successful and employees deserve to share in that success
4935578 we also need to make sure we can sustain that success there must be a bottom line

4935583 the existence of this stockpile of cash means things arent going to be as bad as they could be
4935584 this years back to school season without question is continued belt tightening as the consumer tries to stretch the dollar as far as possible
4935585 since october consumers have been telling us thats what they were going to do and so far consumers have basically done what they said they would
4935586 this year there will be a lot of people who will not be spending at all
4935587 over the years summer jobs have provided about 19 percent of the dollars teenagers and college students spend of their own money on back to school apparel
4935588 thats a huge shift out there that cant be replaced
4935589 when gas prices are 4 a gallon the lava lamp gets crossed off the list
4935590 thats the largest increase in organic private label sales that weve seen in memory
4935591 as long as were at the table were going to keep pursuing that
4935592 it costs 88 cents more per payment to make a check payment versus an electronic payment

4935594 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4935595 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4935596 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
4935597 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4935598 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4935599 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4935600 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4935601 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
4935602 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
4935603 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
4935604 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4935605 they must have thought that if they hired me id retire soon
4935606 the world has changed since they last went job hunting and some dont have a clue what to do
4935607 your r sum may get you in the door but how you handle the interview determines whether you get the job offer
4935608 if you dont believe that your age and experience would be assets to potential employers why should they believe it
4935609 the best way to dispel those stereotypes about older workers is to make sure youre not that kind of person
4935610 be flexible be willing to keep up with new trends in your field be computer savvy
4935611 no one expects you to look like youre 20 but you should look neat trim and up to date
4935612 keep your conversation on a professional level youre there to convince them you can help them but dont overdo it and make them think youre after their job
4935613 though older workers dislike bragging on themselves a job interview is no time for modesty
4935614 no one else will walk through the door to tout your qualities so its up to you
4935615 a good response is to say outright that your top priorities arent title or money
4935616 emphasize that youre a hands on person who because of your experience can hit the ground running and can be trusted to get the job done
4935617 ive accepted the fact that im a mature worker to me that means i have a lot of patience im a loyal employee i have a strong work ethic i dont require supervision and i have a lifetime of experience theres no way im retiring
4935618 prepare for it as you would an in person interview
4935619 most people have to be talked into it but theyre often glad they did it
4935620 they see some silly facial expression or hear some awkward response and they suddenly have the motivation to do better
4935621 tell the interviewer youre more convinced than ever that youre the right person for the job
4935622 and then ask when the company will reach its decision
4935623 we are at an important inflection point for currency markets that the dollar may be forming a multiyear bottom against the majors and may also rally against some emerging market currencies
4935624 in some respects we are somewhat stunned by the inability for investors to comprehend the global nature of the slowdown
4935625 the slowdown that may have started in the u s appears to have spread viruslike to other parts of the world
4935626 profoundly and uniformly awful almost suggesting that america is doing well by comparison
4935627 the decoupling thesis has not worked one iota with the best one can say being that things were delaying in other regions of the world
4935628 the fallout is spreading to some hitherto strong asian economies economic activity in new zealand contracted in the first quarter and in australia retail sales volumes have fallen for two consecutive quarters

4935640 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4935641 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4935642 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it

4935680 i also find comfort in knowing the face of the farmer who grew my food
4935681 there is a great potential for dramatically increasing the amount of locally grown food

4935691 what makes the book so compelling is that you see the revolution from the viewpoint of people doing the killing or being killed not just from washingtons tent
4935692 state workers are the people who do the killing and get killed but traditional political coverage usually stays in the tent
4935693 to be honest i thought he was calling me in to pitch
4935694 that means youre on the road and the winning run is at third theres not much to do but hopefully get a ground ball
4935695 we felt we could play it straight and get a double play
4935696 if the hitter was a faster runner we might have left ichiro in the infield
4935697 the frustrating part is the play was right in front of me
4935698 i got three fingers on the ball instead of two i tried to make the throw too quickly instead making the adjustment i tried to hurry and didnt get anything on the ball
4935699 oh yeah i mean im playing in for a reason if i just let it happen instead of trying to do too much we had a chance
4935700 i was just thinking of the probabilities all the scenarios that might happen
4935701 theres been five weeks worth of games just like that
4935702 weve played with a real intense atmosphere considering where we are in the standings were playing these first place clubs and the games have been coming down like that too often were coming up on the short end
4935703 after the game he indicated that when he threw his last bullpen session in his last game he felt a little something in his elbow
4935704 he hadnt said anything to anybody after the game yesterday he indicated it was sore
4935705 hopefully well get him ready to come back in september
4935706 its nothing serious its something that i think if we were in a different part of the season and the standings he would pitch through it
4935707 i was running to the 30 i saw the defender had a pretty good pursuit angle and in my mind im thinking i want to make this cut great
4935708 for some reason i didnt fall and saw i had 15 yards to go so i just kept running i didnt care what happened next
4935709 it was hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel i was depressed for a while there
4935710 by him being off he studied up so when he was thrown into the fire he would be more than ready
4935711 well mark spitz came along 30 some years ago what he did was spitzian and now im saying that what michael has done is a phelpsian feat and were all proud to be a part of something as special as this
4935712 to be able to imagine everything and to be able to work towards it to have ups have downs to go through everything and to accomplish everything i really ever dreamed of its fun it feels pretty good
4935713 the level of achievement that he has done here is just phenomenal in my opinion i think it is something that well never ever see again in this day and age when the sport is so competitive so close
4935714 i said he could win six or seven and hed need a little bit of luck to fall his way to get eight everything lined up for him perfectly and hes done a wonderful job hes an incredible racer nice guy a good bloke ive known him for these past few years and ive never seen him change
4935715 this is all a dream come true ive been able to accomplish everything ive ever dreamed of it feels pretty good

4935735 in the middle of the game my helmet was off in front of everybody
4935736 he didnt talk to me for a week i had to apologize to him
4935737 we didnt protect well enough up front and we didnt get it off as quickly as we should have
4935738 weve got five or six receivers that can really play that are athletic and skilled
4935739 our plan is lets get those guys the ball lets let them make the plays take the pressure off the offensive line and myself
4935740 we had the arizona game over we won were 10 2 and then we had that long layoff

4935749 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4935750 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
4935751 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind

4935763 i love strasburg but thats hardly original he compares favorably to mark prior at a similar stage of his career hes an elite elite guy and could move very quickly
4935764 id say hes less than two years away from the majors
4935765 hes the one guy out there thats a no 1 starter
4935766 no 2 will probably be a good sized drop off from strasburg
4935767 a ridiculous hitter hes fascinating he has an elbow issue cant throw so he plays 1b if i had to compare him to a player the only one i can come up with is tony gwynn because he has hit 400 two years in a row at unc with speed etc
4935768 theres no high school guys right now worth taking up there
4935769 hes an unbelievable athlete and he has shown a better feel for baseball than expected
4935770 the 08 padres have been sabotaged by poor personnel decisions underperforming players injuries a string of disastrous drafts and most noticeably a change in philosophy as general manager kevin towers autonomy has eroded with ceo sandy alderson and special assistant paul depodesta taking more control of baseball decisions
4935771 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4935772 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4935773 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4935774 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4935775 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races

4935782 the australians had a great push through the middle we pushed back a little bit but congratulations to them
4935783 i have been at this game since i was 12 and now the long hard training in the winter has paid off
4935784 i didnt think we were very sharp today the defense made some good plays but i dont think the offense pressed them enough
4935785 we have to come of age pretty quickly at quarterback
4935786 i think were a great football team if we dont turn the ball over
4935787 had one series where we went in a negative direction
4935788 but on the others he made some nice passes made some great reads and audibled at the appropriate time
4935789 we have two a days its really hot and youre in full gear you have to go out and get everything done

4935796 i dont think theres any way a human being could have beaten him tonight
4935797 hes awesome hes a phenomenon i dont think anyone expected him to run that fast that easy and its just a matter of time before he produces even faster times
4935798 people will say hes showboating but the guys only 21 hes just having fun
4935799 look how much attention hes getting for it i love it hes just bringing more notoriety to the sport i didnt think he was trying to intimidate us or nothing like that he was just having fun to be honest i kind of enjoyed it
4935800 anybody can be beat on any given day last year you guys thought that asafa powell was the greatest thing since sliced bread tonight the guy didnt even medal but this year was just bolts year can he be caught this year probably not
4935801 based on the surveys in the northern breeding grounds of alaska waterfowl counts went down but were still good compared to the long term averages except for scaup populations
4935802 we had a record number of canvasback ducks last year but now their populations are down so we had to close it for them this season
4935803 the goal is to give people an incentive to report their catch information
4935804 these catch reports are a vital tool in managing the crab fishery and developing future seasons thats why its important that we hear from everyone who participates in the puget sound crab fishery
4935805 told us he was looking for a 100 million to 120 million contract
4935806 i dont know where that number would come from false information thats all i can say that makes me look like a jackass you never hear players talking about money i dont think about the offseason me and my agent dont even talk about numbers
4935807 so youre getting micah owings in the adam dunn trade
4935808 the last i saw the fans of oregon fly on boeing planes shop at costco and buy microsoft products
4935809 we know we can beat this team because we did it in the past
4935810 i think the guys played ok but i think we need to improve on a number of points and grow if we are to advance in this tournament the way that we can
4935811 you know one of the other ancillary tragedies is that hugh was taken from something that he loves to do
4935812 i think we got some good reps out of it
4935813 when i connected with dottie the ball started to roll
4935814 if it wasnt for her i dont know where it would have gone
4935815 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4935816 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4935817 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4935818 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4935819 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4935820 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4935821 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4935822 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4935823 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4935824 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4935825 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4935826 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4935827 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4935828 to base a novel on a sustained meditation goes against the spirit of the twentieth century which no longer likes to think at all
4935829 by definition what a narrator recounts is a thing that has happened but each little event as it becomes the past loses its concrete nature and turns into an outline
4935830 the novel remains to use the last observatory from which we can embrace human life as a whole
4935831 when you are inspired by some great purpose some extraordinary project all your thoughts break their bounds
4935832 nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they mistrust each other
4935833 as revolutionaries you are hysterics who demand a new master you will get one
4935834 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4935835 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4935836 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4935837 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4935838 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4935839 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4935840 we showed the rest of the world that we really mean business
4935841 the result is clear and final its evident from the replays that it was an issue of stroking
4935842 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name
4935843 he endured taunt and torment from his teammates myself included for being overzealous with his training
4935844 we caught him sneaking in extra workouts can you imagine we were training six to eight hours a day six days a week and hes got the gall and energy to do an extra without telling anyone about it
4935845 is michael phelps the gold medal winner if we got to do this again i would win it
4935846 yes as you all saw i almost won the gold and if you ask me the clock does not lie i had nothing to do with this filing and neither did my coach mike bottom ive accepted defeat and theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4935847 over the last 10 years the us has contributed almost 4 billion in economic assistance to jordan and we are pleased to have a large increase this year
4935848 the talks represent a positive step which opens a new chapter in ties between the two sides that could pave the ground for new alliances which boost the interests of both the jordanian and palestinian peoples
4935849 political logic makes it imperative for the jordanian government to establish relations with an ascending force like hamas which won the latest palestinian general elections and curtail its ties with descending groups
4935850 syrias supporting stance to the palestinian cause since it is the essence of the arab israeli conflict
4935851 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
4935852 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
4935853 clearly its not going to hold up under the stress of me going out there every five days and throwing a lot of pitches
4935854 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4935855 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4935856 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4935857 the army marksmanship unit is comprised of the best shooters in the armed forces
4935858 it has 23 olympic medals thats more shooting medals in just one unit of the army than any other country except china
4935859 when he was 12 years old he told me he wanted to go to the olympics so i built him a skeet range in the backyard
4935860 life in a socialist nanny state when petty bureaucrats have power over life amp death
4935861 i said when we get beat i want to get beat by a better team and they were the better team tonight
4935862 they had the better pitching the better hitting and the better defense hats off to them
4935863 that kid fontenot pitched a great game and he brought it
4935864 we definitely should have had him out of there one or two batters earlier
4935865 if you dont have something nice to say dont say it at all
4935866 friday night and beyond the shabbat experience step by step
4935867 gossip ten pathways to eliminate it from your life and transform your soul
4935868 thats a question that has been bothering me lately too of course im a little bit older than you
4935869 i think were here to learn and to grow and to be nice to one another
4935870 well some people have more to learn than others i guess
4935871 i dunno mom whats the point of trying to learn a whole bunch of stuff if by the time you know it all youre either dead or too old to do anything worth knowing about anyway
4935872 mmmm well you are a thinker thats for sure perhaps the most important thing is to just be a good person i guess thats what god really wants us to do

4935877 relax a little kid even if people act mean or seem not to care or you feel all alone youre never really alone there really is a god in this world and youre loved more than you can even begin to imagine
4935878 but as the specter of dozens of red flagged emails that direly needed replies began to haunt me i became increasingly agitated a frantic 45 seconds later i called microsoft israels technical support
4935879 i dont think youll be able to do it on your own are you willing to share control of your computer with me until we solve the problem
4935880 hes helping me do what i could never do by myself i guess some people really have control issues

4935890 the high court has put a block on the police practice of making drink drivers pay for a doctor to take their blood samples the ruling by justice christine french is a win for christchurch barrister andrew bailey and may mean urgent changes are needed to legislation the christchurch court news website reported
4935891 the ruling by justice christine french is a win for christchurch barrister andrew bailey and may mean urgent changes are needed to legislation the christchurch court news website reported baileys client was convicted in the district court of drink driving in march he was fined 600 and ordered to pay court costs of 130 medical expenses of 102 60 and an analyst fee of 93 and disqualified from driving for six months
4935892 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement
4935893 most of us girls we have to stop our sport so we can start a family but for her to have a family and still get back in and win the silver medal is just absolutely incredible
4935894 its one of their first real fashion shows so give it up for wal mart
4935895 good value and good style for the kids for back to school
4935896 im not saying were the best designers in the world but being able to make what we like that would be so cool
4935897 we love dressing up and putting on different kinds of clothes
4935898 it was a lot of fun maybe there is a holiday album in our future
4935899 i think it s very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
4935900 i felt a pop in my foot i couldnt stand on it
4935901 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon on a bus
4935902 if i would have pushed harder it would have been better i still shut it down i go round by round i dont want to think about it too much
4935903 to investigate the facts of consciousness its combinations and relations
4935904 ultimately discover the laws which govern these relations and combinations
4935905 that psychology may be at least in part as independent of introspection as physics
4935906 take as a starting point first the observable fact that organisms man and animal alike do adjust themselves to their environment
4935907 secondly that certain stimuli lead the organisms to make responses
4935908 making behavior not consciousness the objective point of our attack
4935909 that because so little is known about the central nervous system it serves as the last refuge of the soul in psychology
4935910 directs attention to the history of the individual and to the current environment where the real causes of behavior are to be found
4935911 if the proper attention is paid to the variables controlling behavior and an appropriate behavioral unit is chosen orderliness appears directly in the behavior and the postulated theoretical processes become superfluous
4935912 is not that they do not exist but that they are not relevant
4935913 has led to an effective technology applicable to education psychotherapy and the design of cultural practices in general
4935914 the received wisdom of today is that behaviorism has been refuted its methods have failed and it has little to offer modern psychology
4935915 situated cognition distributed and decentralized cognition real world robotics and artificial life
4935916 complex and iterated processes which continually loop between brain body and technological environment
4935917 intelligent process just is the spatially and temporally extended one which zig zags between brain body and world
4935918 represents both the unit of nerve structure and the type of nerve function
4935919 does not by itself make them unamenable to scientific treatment
4935920 as desirable to develop the behaviourist method to the fullest possible extent
4935921 coincidence between the level of the mercury and the mark of the scale numbered 23 4
4935922 the meaning of a psychological statement consists solely in the function of abbreviating the description of certain modes of physical response characteristic of the bodies of men and animals
4935923 paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds
4935924 the introduction and application of psychological terms and hypotheses is logically and methodologically analogous to the introduction and application of the terms and hypotheses of a physical theory
4935925 meant to throw light on the facts of our language
4935926 as knowing believing or guessing something as hoping dreading intending or shirking something as designing this or being amused at that
4935927 presuppose the legitimacy of the disjunction either there exist minds or there exist bodies but not both
4935928 would be like saying either she bought a left hand and a right hand glove or she bought a pair of gloves but not both
4935929 that these verbs are supposed to denote the occurrence of specific modifications
4935930 that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else
4935931 someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case
4935932 are connected with the primitive the natural expressions of the sensation and used in their place
4935933 a child has hurt himself and he cries and then adults talk to him and teach him exclamations and later sentences they teach the child new pain behaviour
4935934 the verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe it
4935935 in which a person could write down or give vocal expression to his inner experiences
4935936 to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule
4935937 thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying
4935938 verbs nouns and adjectives with which in ordinary life we describe the wits characters and higher grade performances of people with whom we have do
4935939 we are not referring to occult episodes of which their overt acts and utterances are effects we are referring to those overt acts and utterances themselves
4935940 dispositional words like know believe aspire clever and humorous signify multi track dispositions
4935941 to explain an action as done from a specified motive or inclination is not to describe the action as the effect of a specified cause
4935942 are not happenings and are not therefore of the right type to be causes
4935943 to explain an act as done from a certain motive is not analogous to saying that the glass broke because a stone hit it but to the quite different type of statement that the glass broke when the stone hit it because the glass was brittle
4935944 to correlate the action explained with some occult cause but to subsume it under a propensity or behavior trend
4935945 the ancient and commonsense position that rationalization is a species of causal explanation
4935946 can gain clarity and substance from a better understanding of the workings of language whereas little understanding of the working of language is to be hoped for in mentalistic terms
4935947 having construed behavioral dispositions in turn as physiological states i end up with the so called identity theory of mind mental states are states of the body
4935948 is not a metaphysical theory it is the denial of a metaphysical theory
4935949 where activity is exhibited it is not necessarily inappropriate to talk of movements but it will be so to do so in the same context in the same universe of discourse
4935950 in terms of outward acts or dispositions to acts like
4935951 lack the behavioral dispositions envisioned by the behaviorists to be associated with pain even though they do in fact have pain
4935952 an exactly analogous example of perfect pain pretenders shows that no behavioral disposition is sufficient for pain either
4935953 which behavioral dispositions a desire issues in depends on other states of the desirer and similar points apply to behaviorist analyses of belief and other mental states
4935954 a disposition to pain behavior is not a sufficient condition of having pain since the behavioral disposition could be produced by a number of different combinations of mental states e
4935955 conclusion one cannot define the conditions under which a given mental state will issue in a given behavioral disposition
4935956 regarded as decisive refutations of behaviorist analyses of many mental states such as belief desire and pain
4935957 definable in terms of its causal relations to inputs outputs and other mental states
4935958 the defects which this position exhibits are also exhibited by the more complex and sophisticated positions which are actually held
4935959 definable in terms of its causal relations to inputs outputs and other mental states
4935960 that the logically necessary and sufficient conditions for the ascription of a mental state
4935961 refer not just to environmental variables but to other mental states of the organism
4935962 faith that one will surely get to pure behavioral ascriptions
4935963 psychologists can provide methodologically reputable accounts only of such aspects of behavior as are the effects of environmental variables
4935964 the spontaneity and freedom from local environmental control that behavior often exhibits
4935965 there would seem to be nothing in the project of explaining behavior by reference to mental processes which requires a commitment to their epistemological privacy in the traditional sense
4935966 for better or worse a materialist cannot accept such a commitment since his view is that mental events are a species of physical events and physical events are publicly observable at least in principle
4935967 failure of behavioristic psychology to provide even a first approximation to a plausible theory of cognition
4935968 that the most interesting certainly the hardest problems about thinking are unlikely to be much illuminated by any kind of computational theory we are now able to imagine
4935969 by far the best theory of cognition that weve got indeed the only one weve got thats worth the bother
4935970 to provide even a first approximation of a plausible theory
4935971 the behaviorist seems to leave out the mental phenomena in question
4935972 soon came to seem so bloodless and spineless a being that even the opponents of these behaviorist theories began to feel shy of imposing heavy burdens upon his spectral shoulders
4935973 imagery from galton on has been the inner stronghold of a psychology based on introspection
4935974 i may have to grant a few sporadic cases of imagery to him who will not be otherwise convinced
4935975 that the images of such a one are as sporadic and as unnecessary to his well being and well thinking as a few hairs more or less on his head
4935976 not to know the right idioms to discuss these matters
4935977 discussion of them in the official idioms may have at least some internal fifth column efficacy
4935978 though you and i have exactly the same functional organization the sensation that you have when you look at red things is phenomenally the same as the sensation that i have when i look at green things
4935979 that it is possible that a mental state of a person x be functionally identical to a state of y even though x s state has qualitative character while y s state lacks qualitative character altogether
4935980 the prague school and north american functionalist approach to syntax
4935981 to fully appreciate the merits of laras work in the same manner her avid fans do you would have to consider the extent of her youth the considerable size of her portfolio at least 5 years worth of work and counting and the infinite expanse of her imagination discounting laras account on online photo sharing application flickr a modest average of 6000 individuals per day peruse her extensive gallery on art community deviantart where she assumes the well known sobriquet of larafairie features on photography magazines such as practical photography and digital camera magazine only confirm laras charm as a promising d butante in the world of photography the allure of laras work transcends that of her undeniably photogenic face staring out of many moody self portraits instead the major attraction lies in her ability to capture spellbinding stories within the confines of the photographs borders for instance her photo projects namely phobias and crime scenes highlight her ability to produce a cohesive narrative through photography even at her tender age laras flourishing reputation as a meticulous photographer has allowed her to play her trade mainly shooting portraits her list of clients includes music artistes inme and sam roman uk based jewellers kokkino and laura bezant as well as freelance dancer rachel martin laras masterful visual storytelling stems from her attention to the minutest detail in which she assumes almost total control over the resulting photograph
4935982 since the court maintained the fine the pcb cannot allow him to play for pakistan as it would be tantamount to flouting the ruling of the court
4935983 females might use song complexity as an indicator of how smart the male is
4935984 neeltje is the first to experimentally demonstrate a link between the expression of song and some aspect of cognition that really matters its a really important study
4935985 what females are really interested in is how smart you are as an academic i like to see that message

4935987 he lawson came to the meeting with a list of players he thought should play for pakistan in the champions trophy
4935988 when he was told by the selectors that they would review his list and would also consult with the pcb before naming the national team lawson lost his cool he told the selectors what now you will discuss my team in an angry tone and was immediately told to behave
4935989 lawson was told by the selectors that he can only give his input which would be considered by the selectors they also made it clear that the selection committee had the final say over the team combination the coach wasnt very happy with that argument
4935990 put up a half million dollars to keep out of jail a priest convicted of sodomizing a teenage boy
4935991 you can make these up to one week in advance
4935992 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4935993 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4935994 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

4935997 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4935998 thats why hes the he never lost his soul in chicago
4935999 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4936000 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh

4936005 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
4936006 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
4936007 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
4936008 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
4936009 why cant i play the best golf of my life

4936022 thought is the fountain of action life and manifestation make the fountain pure and all will be pure
4936023 pure thoughts crystallize into habits of temperance and self control which solidify into circumstances of repose and peace thoughts of courage self reliance and decision crystallize into manly habits which solidify into circumstances of success plenty and freedom
4936024 a particular train of thought persisted in be it good or bad cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances a man cannot directly choose his circumstances but he can choose his thoughts and so indirectly yet surely shape his circumstances

4936032 the whole purpose of the project is to provide technology training to teachers so they can better support students in the area of technology
4936033 with the amount of technology out there its where do you start and how do you apply it so there are a lot of variables that make it difficult for teachers
4936034 these students potentially are going to be out there in their own classrooms
4936035 if we could get them tech savvy early on the better off theyll be

4936040 we just feel it is really important for young people to get out and say how they feel about these issues and share their stories
4936041 picking switch over durants signaled the groups intent to become the new face of politics
4936042 he did wink at me at the start of the hearing last week so i assume that means weve made up
4936043 throughout this campaign i have developed a great deal of respect for my primary opponent but for three reasons i believe that i am the better candidate first i have more extensive experience as a practicing lawyer including more courtroom experience than any candidate in the race in my 20 years of practice i have successfully handled important cases in trial and appellate courts throughout our state and federal systems including before the arizona supreme court the county attorneys office handles a wide variety of cases on behalf of the people of maricopa county and we are best served by someone familiar with all levels of our court system second as general counsel to the governor i have given legal advice at the highest levels of state government on important public policy issues one key responsibility of the county attorney is to give legal advice to the board of supervisors the sheriff and other county agencies this is a part of the job that mr thomas has botched badly for instance with his misguided opinion allowing development around luke air force base in direct violation of state law finally it will take enormous financial resources to beat mr thomas in november after all he has spent millions of public dollars promoting himself i am the only candidate who has been able to raise the kind of money needed to unseat an incumbent to achieve the needed change in our county attorneys office people should vote for me in the democratic primary
4936044 i believe voters are demanding professional law enforcement not political posturing from the county attorneys office
4936045 in the new permit we are asking for tighter controls
4936046 might be exposed to higher than normal levels of hydrogen sulfide if you live near a wastewater treatment plant a gas and oil drilling operation a farm with manure storage or livestock confinement facilities or a landfill

4936049 we met with the development community at least eight to 10 years ago
4936050 they were supposed to disclose to everyone that bought a home in the area that there is a wastewater plant there
4936051 when it comes from smithfield beef it is a smell of burning blood or burning carcasses totally different from the hydrogen sulfide rotten egg smell
4936052 and also because i have taken so many copious journal notes over the past three years knowing when its the nauseous odor coming and it totally correlates with when they are doing their stuff over at the tolleson wastewater treatment plant
4936053 weve got a lot of dairy and a lot of other things going on around there but its not an everyday occurrence or something that is a concern to us
4936054 an officer manually concentrating on nothing but stolen vehicles could run 400 a day maybe if hes working real hard
4936055 these guys getting off their desks and hitting the streets helps a lot
4936056 it helps buy in from the patrol guys because they see us out there
4936057 we can help them write search warrants for chop shops and help them shut down some of the bigger operations out there

4936188 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
4936189 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4936190 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information

4936199 yours is a perfect mate can you imagine a badass horse with wings we let them make a killer litter i lead your tribe to the cows how does that sound
4936200 but dont get any ideas monster gets to be on top
4936201 doesnt look like were going to make a beast with two backs
4936202 well kuriosit tencaf does a great strawberry crem of love
4936203 i would really prefer to see something concrete after fifteen minutes mr kidd i thought you would at the very least have prepared a powerpoint presentation
4936204 how our technology could help take your business to the next level
4936205 is what your rhizome thing can do that we already cant were not big on outsourcing or crowdsourcing or whateversourching here at genesis technologies
4936206 people loved it until the indians became more expensive than the cambridge boffins but us weve always been built on top of solid ip and research and
4936207 plain old fashioned hard work mr kidd we dont like cutting corners here
4936208 currently it takes you close to three years just to develop the design for a new organism right the carbovore took something like seven
4936209 lots and lots of potential chemical structures that you can build living things out of
4936210 and dont worry about the cannonballs theyre unstable aerogel with metal flakes theyll evaporate before they hit the ground
4936211 lucien get the security out there the fuckers have weapons
4936212 theyre not exactly ours but yes this is a demonstration of rhizome technology
4936213 i can get rid of them in a second just a moment
4936214 did you know that there is no commercially available electromagnetic launcher that would throw a one kilogram object this high
4936215 our clients in singapore im sure youve heard of the beanstalk project wanted one or its equivalent except that their cannonballs weigh more than a hundred tons and need to go to geostationary orbit we signed the contract three days ago
4936216 and now weve got one or a scale model and a proof of concept anyway
4936217 our game engine and puppet master systems are used to run more than four thousand pervasive and alternate reality games under various license agreements all over the world thats approximately three hundred million players with high student demographics penetration close to 70 in some universities the average player spends between ten and 21 hours a week on game related activities most of which involve social interaction and collaborative puzzle solving thats about a hundred million person years every year almost all of it high quality brainpower
4936218 the engine allows us to embed obfuscated problems into the games ranging from design and optimisation problems to
4936219 dealing with large molecular shape spaces we can embed such structures in content pervasive game players see on their sleeves and have to sort we can make them build castles out of them in the metaverse and we almost always find that they do something crazy something unexpected we can trace the collabrorative design process pretty well 3d model wikis physics forums but we didnt know that the solution would turn up in the spanish main game it just did
4936220 well have 300 million people building the next carbovore for you without knowing it and having fun can quantum computers do that
4936221 i suppose we can find some funding for a pilot project at least lucien will sort it out wont you
4936222 although perhaps you can find something less metaphorical for your next demonstration mr kidd

4936228 i am writing this down because i consider mahmoud ahmadinejad not only as a retard but also as a very dangerous idiot his opinion about women religion science knowledge law etc is disgusting and his holocaust denial is insane
4936229 i have so much emotions going through my head so much excitement the biggest thing is nothings impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is a little imagination
4936230 for decades people are going to be talking about what hes doing
4936231 hes been breaking world records by two three seconds who does that whos done that besides him ever
4936232 every time i watch him swim im more and more in awe of what he does
4936233 i think being his teammate and being part of the team while hes doing all this kind of gives us a different perspective years and years down the road people will realize more and more how amazing and how special he is
4936234 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4936235 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4936236 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4936237 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun

4936240 can i get by on eating a bag of gorp for three days
4936241 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4936242 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4936243 i had to put that on hold though i couldnt do both 100 before i was trying to do both things the studying and the fighting i was only really doing both halfway though i couldnt commit 100 to them after having a couple of fights in the ufc i decided to concentrate on fighting
4936244 ill take the fight wherever i feel i have an advantage over my opponent
4936245 if they can be submitted ill work hard to get into position and submit them if they can be beaten in the stand up ill stand with them and beat them there it all depends on who im fighting and what they are specialists at i try to be an all round fighter
4936246 hes real tough a good competitor and is very well rounded
4936247 im having to prepare in all areas to be able to cope with wherever the fight goes his strongest point is his ability to fight in all different areas hes very well rounded and can do a bit of everything hes one of the best fighters in the ufc and im really looking forward to fighting him im always trying to improve my game and there is no better way to do that than by fighting the best guys
4936248 i think he might have the advantage on the ground but i think ill be stronger in the standup
4936249 i think marquardts probably the toughest guy ive fought so far
4936250 if he marquardt didnt lose those points he would have won
4936251 it was a really good fight nate did some illegal moves and i think its only right that he got penalized for it thales won and he deserved the victory according to the rules but nate probably proved he was the better fighter overall

4936296 if you cut through a cocoon in mid winter a thick creamy liquid will spill out and nothing more what goes into that cocoon in autumn is a caterpillar and what comes out in spring is entirely different a moth complete with papery wings hairlike legs and antennae yet this same creature spends winter as a gray green liquid a primordial soup the miraculous meltdown of an animal into a case of fluid chemicals and its exquisite re generation into a different animal like a stupendous jigsaw was a feat that far from putting him off fed clives obsession

4936305 apparently writing about a subject such as birth from the point of view of a fourteen year old girl is too much of a stretch for this male author his unimaginative writing style is also lacking he doesnt trust his reader to remember an event that happened twenty pages prior like restating the fact that the trial was difficult for the family which is obvious all in all disappointing and irritating
4936306 wow you really arent very good are you youre certainly not good enough
4936307 wow you are one of the only readers to feel this way and to have such rage toward me i am so sorry fingers crossed someday i dont disappoint you

4936454 for years we have been talking about location based services as the next frontier of the internet
4936455 fire eagle is a huge step in making that happen
4936456 where i drive when i get there and whether i stop on the way is not the business of my insurance company or any other corporation who wants to place eyes in my car
4936457 for individuals who do not want their location to be known these services could be harmful
4936458 the industry has been wandering around in circles looking for killer services and applications that might not exist
4936459 as the joke goes a really useful lbs application would be one that could point you to a really useful lbs application

4936462 i dont know what youre doing but youve changed everything its totally gonzo
4936463 gonzo perhaps derived from the french canadian gonzeaux the word had a couple of different meanings but bill cardoso used it in the boston bar derivation referring to the last man standing after a night of drinking gonzo had a nice ring

4936465 the airman although talented will not be guided by policy or personal advice and guidance sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airman staff members he has little consideration for military bearing or dress and seems to dislike the service and want out as soon as possible
4936466 stopped working for the observer by the summer of 1965
4936467 he drank a lot probably enough during a twenty four hour span to render a minor league infield unconscious but he could hold his liquor longtime friends could remember only seeing him truly out of control drunk two or maybe three times during the course of a forty year friendship his fans knew the character not the man and when they approached him they often felt the need to affect being high if they werent already they had assumed hunter would want them that way but he hated sloppy inarticulate drunks he breakfasted on bloody marys and beer and drank wild turkey and chivas by the tumbler but he was rarely drunk
4936468 balding aviator shade wearing rolling stone writer who hallucinated that he was seeing bats
4936469 eventually though he became imprisoned by this image and as he wrote less and less he let the image blend into reality his first wife sandy who probably knew and understood him better than anyone got it right
4936470 he was a tortured tragic figure i do not think that he was a great writer i think he clearly had great potential both as a writer and a leader however he fell dramatically and a very very long time ago hunter wanted to be a great writer and he had the genius the talent and early on the will and the means he was horrified by whom sic he had become and ashamed or i really should say tortured he knew he had failed he knew that his writing was absolutely not great this was part of the torture and yet he could never climb back the image the power the drugs the alcohol the money all of it he never became that great american writer he had wanted to be nowhere close and he knew it

4936474 the process is probably the most valuable thing the way that making a work with people changes you and changes the people probably has more importance than the actual objects left behind
4936475 i love festivals for me its just a chance to get out there and see other bands and run into old friends
4936476 just like at bonaroo festivals offer different elements eye candy and little places to escape
4936477 green is becoming this big catchphrase for marketing its just anything organic was big a few years ago
4936478 its very trendy to be green and thats very wonderful because for a long long time it wasnt any awareness that we can raise on any level is fantastic
4936479 were traveling in a bus which isnt the most green thing but we have been making a big effort to reuse and recycle
4936480 i like the climate and the fog and the hills it just has a certain appeal to me
4936481 the decline of the record industry has in some ways been quite good for the health of music
4936482 it gives people other roots and avenues through which to get their music across
4936483 its bad for the business but its not bad for the music
4936484 its in my backyard and the lineup is just full of bands that i like
4936485 radiohead is always a treat tom petty beck the mother hips id like to see all of those
4936486 i think that ultimately it comes down to how we choose to spend our entertainment dollar festivals are usually a better deal
4936487 a festival ticket is probably no more expensive than seeing bruce springsteen three times or even just seeing him once in the cheap seats theyre just a great way to spend a few carefree days listening to music and not having a care in the world
4936488 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
4936489 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
4936490 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
4936491 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
4936492 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
4936493 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
4936494 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
4936495 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
4936496 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
4936497 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
4936498 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
4936499 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
4936500 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
4936501 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
4936502 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
4936503 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
4936504 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
4936505 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
4936506 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
4936507 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
4936508 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare

4936511 there are few psychotic persons among the civilians in okinawan shima
4936512 prior to the war there was not a single asylum or psychiatrist for the entire island which had a population of nearly 400 000 persons in the western world over fifty percent of all hospital beds were allocated to those suffering from mental disease the relatively few psychotic persons encountered in okinawa shima pose a problem for speculation the fact that these people remained emotionally stable after having suffered heavy bombings losing their homes and their crops and having entire families annihilated was astonishing
4936513 and i believe that i can supply one of the explanations first of all i do not believe that these people are constitutionally sounder than americans rather in my opinion this psychological stamina stems from the excellent start the okinawan child gets in life he is well mothered

4936525 for students of history the manner in which the second world war ended is even more fascinating than that in which it began giants of their respective nations or rather mortal men cast into giants roles resolved the great issues of the twentieth century on battlefields in three dimensions and in the war rooms of their capitals some of the most populous societies on earth teemed in flux technology displayed a terrifying maturity for millions 1944 45 brought liberation the banishment of privation fear and oppression but air attacks during those years killed larger numbers of people than in the rest of the conflict put together posterity knows that the war ended in august 1945 however it would have provided scant comfort to the men who risked their lives in the pacific island battles as well as in the other bloody campaigns of that spring and summer to be assured that the tumult would soon be stilled soldiers may accept a need to be the first to die in a war but there is often an unseemly scramble to avoid becoming the last
4936526 along with a thrill of power and the instinctive pleasure at the thought of japan cringing in abject surrender americas deep rooted humanitarianism had begun to assert itself
4936527 for japans civilian politicians it was the dropping of the atomic bombs for the japanese army it was the russian invasion of manchuria
4936528 what is remarkable is not how many japanese rejected surrender but how many embraced it gratefully whatever protestations they made to the contrary this outcome once more highlights the gulf between the private acknowledgement of reality and the public embrace of fantasy which had been the bane of the japanese nation and of asia

4936531 the standing joke people have is they run five miles out here at the academy and thatll be the last five miles theyll ever run
4936532 our guys are in the best shape of their lives after six months at the academy and were trying to get them to maintain it
4936533 by having them maintain fitness youre going to cut down on sick leave and stress on the officers
4936534 it takes a couple of years but gauged on body composition changes and participation levels id say its working
4936535 were looking at high blood pressure and heart disease because of the availability of fast food officers often dont have a lot of time to eat so they drive up and grab something we try to break that habit teach them here to pack a lunch and eat properly
4936536 listen the surgeon general says americans are fat and who are the people we recruit from americans so what we have to do at the academy is get people in shape in a relatively short period of time

4936540 im not a betting guy but i would put down everything on this team winning
4936541 from the perspective of mike phillips widow id say were worse off fighting the battle
4936542 from mike phillips perspective the day he was killed im sure he felt it was a battle that needed to be fought that the benefits outweighed the risk
4936543 are about the most evil thing in the community that i know of right now
4936544 its what i call the unholy trinity guns violence and drugs
4936545 because theres an element of violence that is connected with the distribution of drugs
4936546 it just requires an aggressive prosecution of all of the offenses from where i sit and where i see things happening not to fight that fight would send the wrong message
4936547 i know what theyre going through weve sent them off into this dangerous world and weve made it more dangerous rather than making it safer
4936548 whats at the root of these deaths isnt shoddy police work
4936549 i look at this as a prima facie discussion about why laws should change
4936550 and im going to presume those that enforce the law will point to this as why they need to redouble their efforts

4936559 i dont know really im pretty blank still and im feeling quite tired and sort of an anti climax this morning im sure tonight it will all sink in when the medal ceremony happens
4936560 how simple can it be they have the ability to do that sometimes and they sort of grab on to you they tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
4936561 she tried but eventually i was able to get the flag and to run over of my own free will and give kirsten a hug which was awesome
4936562 i got home about 1 30 1 45 and there was a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house to have a toast of champagne pop a few bubbles was pretty awesome just to share that moment knowing it was so late and they were still waiting up for me was pretty special
4936563 i still feel like someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and tell me it was big dream
4936564 for us it wasnt about getting a medal yesterday it was about rowing well
4936565 when we crossed the finish line it was a relief that the physical side of the race was over and i know i was just stoked to have gone out there and raced as hard as i could and as technically well as i could
4936566 weve slowly been getting our confidence back but it wasnt till the heats last week i really felt we were competitive thats all we wanted to be we knew if were competitive we had a shot at getting a medal
4936567 its been a pretty rocky road for me this week
4936568 obviously its had its ups and downs overall theres little bit of disappointment but certainly no regret i put everything out there but wasnt good enough
4936569 no its the olympics if you get ill youve got to deal with it i still felt i was capable of winning that race and probably if it was 1900m long i would have won it but its 2k race
4936570 i dont think ill ever stop doing it in one form or another
4936571 the first thing that came across my mind was that i didnt feel good about coming into the clubhouse
4936572 once i walked through the door it was a bitter thought like a rejection from me to the clubhouse even though i dont have the same locker i didnt want to see it to be honest it was a very bad moment

4936576 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4936577 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4936578 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it

4936580 i was so exhausted by the end of the day that id get home and wouldnt even look at my computer
4936581 i found it to be very dull and surprisingly very draining
4936582 i find that when doing technical writing projects i have a lot more creativity and energy for other types of writing projects
4936583 technical writing in a lot of ways requires a lot of creativity and problem solving
4936584 for example many projects require creativity to get and keep readers interested in the material some require or benefit from humor nontraditional designs or creative ways of presenting information all of which require creativity
4936585 technical writers have a wide variety of jobs working on a wide variety of projects
4936586 it is very demanding very time consuming and you must learn a great deal in a short period of time
4936587 if you want to make a lot of money enjoy learning and dont mind the grind technical writing is a great place to hone your mechanical writing skills
4936588 if you write a lot already are submitting and know thats what you want to do i would hesitate to promote technical writing
4936589 if your goal is to be the next stephen king or james michener or anne rice or diana gabaldon dont become a technical writer stick with your craft
4936590 things are great and were moving on to the good stuff
4936591 weve both learned a lot and know that our family comes first and thats the main thing for both of us
4936592 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place
4936593 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4936594 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away

4936617 reineke was a little bit erratic but found his way
4936618 i know that in these types of games your first one youre pitching on a lot of emotion and adrenaline and it saps you but he hung in there it was good to see
4936619 it was good to get a big hit there and get him a nice cushion it was a big night for him and obviously a good win for us
4936620 we scored three runs early but we couldnt polish reineke off
4936621 we didnt really hit a ball hard after the third inning we let a lot of fastballs go by
4936622 he walks guys and gets behind on them he kind of slows down and looks like he cant get into the flow of the game

4936648 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4936649 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4936650 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4936651 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4936652 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4936667 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4936668 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4936669 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4936670 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4936671 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4936672 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society

4936726 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4936727 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4936728 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4936729 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4936730 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4936731 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4936732 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4936733 tape delay by nbc faces end run by online fans
4936734 nbc which owns the exclusive rights to broadcast the olympics in the united states spent most of friday trying to keep it that way
4936735 nbcs decision to delay broadcasting the opening ceremonies by 12 hours sent people across the country to their computers to poke holes in nbcs technological wall by finding newsfeeds on foreign broadcasters web sites and by watching clips of the ceremonies on youtube and other sites
4936736 in response nbc sent frantic requests to web sites asking them to take down the illicit clips and restrict authorized video to host countries
4936737 as the first summer games of the broadband age commenced in china old network habits have never seemed so archaic or so irrelevant
4936738 the olympics to me is a benchmark for how fast weve gone with technology
4936739 thirty months ago no one was talking about youtube now its a verb
4936740 the long tail why the future of business is selling less of more
4936741 ik dacht terug aan mijn engelse juf die ooit heeft gezegd dat het niks met mij zou worden en ook aan al die andere moeilijke momenten het zijn vier mooie jaren met ups en downs geweest ik voel me gezegend met mijn talent en doorzettingsvermogen ik heb daarom mijn droom kunnen realiseren
4936742 alle doelen die ik vooraf had gesteld heb ik hier bereikt ik ben daar echt enorm dankbaar voor

4936746 greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends so what must love be in order for all of this to be true knowing god
4936747 if a father continues to be cheerful and carefree while his son is getting into trouble or if a husband remains unmoved when his wife is in distress we wonder at once how much love there can be in their relationship for we know that those who truly love are only happy when those whom that love are truly happy also
4936748 jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men
4936749 very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
4936750 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus
4936751 not long after that the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living
4936752 when he came to his senses he said how many of my fathers hired men have food to spare and here i am starving to death
4936753 but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him
4936754 the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you
4936755 the older brother became angry and refused to go in
4936756 my son the father said you are always with me and everything i have is yours
4936757 i dont care about you i only want what you can give me in fact i wish you were dead lets pretend that you are dead and just give me what is mine
4936758 dear friends since god so loved us we also ought to love one another
4936759 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us

4936765 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games

4936786 i said by the time i get there shell be unconscious
4936787 there is still a significant amount of cdo collateralised debt obligation instruments out there that are still to be brought to account
4936788 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion dollars of that to come to account
4936789 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4936790 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4936791 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4936792 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4936793 those banks that have taken a more cautious or a more prudent approach in their lending are seeing the benefits of that
4936794 the business is a good business but it does have a number of complex parts

4936802 weve been under threat all this year and before they want our coaching stocks

4936806 harlem was the kind of place where women were only as good as their biscuits and if you didnt look good you better cook good
4936807 so i was taught at an early age to cook everything from scratch nothing instant and i became a passionate gourmet cook
4936808 but i always loved cheese and was fascinated by it
4936809 but they are such infectious marketers i tried their naughty nellie beer i liked it and immediately thought of using it to wash the rinds of my cheese once they allowed me to use the name naughty nellie a raw cheese was born
4936810 we tested two five gallon buckets with the yak who ate it up like oatmeal mush
4936811 next i sequestered one of the cows and when the nutritionist came out and it was a thumbs up we started feeding it to all the animals
4936812 they had it analyzed and even though it is a brewerys by product it still contains 27 percent nutritional value perfect food for their animals
4936813 the spent grain is sweet and this translates to the cheese our cheese is teat to table in two days
4936814 i add interesting ingredients to my fresh ch vre logs to make them gourmet my holiday ginger log with candied ginger nutmeg and pumpkin seeds is like eatin a big sweet potato pie

4936834 we just told them we had confidence in them said gonzalez who maintains the same even keel he saw bobby cox display as part of coxs coaching staff in atlanta
4936835 we won seven in a row at the end of april beginning of may and we havent done that since if we could do that somewhere in the next six weeks well be right in it
4936836 i asked kevin how do you want to go after this guy
4936837 i looked at him there was no question what we needed to do i knew he just wanted to go after him let the man work just call the game and let him execute his pitches
4936838 our guys are going to be playing for us a lot longer than the red sox will have their guys even though lowell and beckett are special and that was a hard deal to make
4936839 the ceiling is unlimited for him said marlins special assistant andre dawson the eight time national league all star whose plaque should be hanging in cooperstown
4936840 hanleys so laid back it hurts him at times but hes going to have to accept one day the role that he is the big guy that weve built this ballclub around these guys feed off him that will be another steppingstone when he realizes that his ability is what he puts into it
4936841 getting those two pitchers back was like us making a trade loria said
4936842 and we felt we had a need for a guy like arthur rhodes the lefty setup man acquired from seattle this is the pitching we dreamed of having
4936843 we have a great chemistry on this team and i think that will be a big ingredient down the stretch
4936844 its been a hard and painful training process for me but i just kept my head down and did my weightlifting and training
4936845 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4936846 i certainly have no regrets with my preparation and what ive been able to do here

4936850 ive been waiting for this moment for two years i had expectations for the 400 freestyle but this is a great surprise
4936851 im going to celebrate this appropriately its been two years since i havent gone back to my hometown im going to see my dad my friends my brothers and sisters
4936852 i felt good in the first 400 at 800 and 900 i started believing i could win
4936853 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100 to save energy and attack in the final 50
4936854 im happy for ous if it wasnt an american winning it then i would want him to win it
4936855 hes a great friend of mine and a great competitor hes as tough as nails
4936856 the gold medal will more than make up for his setbacks hes been training with a vengeance over the past year since that hiccup about a year or two ago and hes proven it every day in work out
4936857 im not going to decide now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4936858 it was a tough game they came back we came back we continue to fight hopefully well continue the rest of the year

4936889 this job is management its a job to make sure theres no corruption
4936890 the best way to combat corruption from my perspective has always been to automate and use technology
4936891 all of these provide opportunities to tag who touches what when
4936892 as long as theres so much money involved as long as delays are so expensive it will always be a risk

4936908 we have some beautiful artwork lots of archival photos all the restaurant and bar equipment the turf club furnishings tv sets you name it theres no shortage of items to catch your eye
4936909 so somebody who wants to take home their lucky seat thats been good to them for years and years this is their chance
4936910 in his first three starts hes been a little shaky early
4936911 but he showed tonight hes going to be a really good pitcher he fell behind 2 0 and we tied it right up in the first then mazzaro came back with five zeroes he went 6 2 3 innings and gave up two runs ill take that every time out
4936912 were playing pretty good ball right now youd hope you can build and build and get better and better but im pretty much pleased with how weve been going
4936913 hes a different person now i think than he was years ago
4936914 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
4936915 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
4936916 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
4936917 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
4936918 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
4936919 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
4936920 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man

4936922 the most common cause of accidents involving youth operators was operator inexperience 67 percent excessive speed was a factor in 57 percent of accidents followed by operator inattention 53 percent
4936923 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4936924 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4936925 what i traced this to is a certain selfishness on my part
4936926 i was so obsessed with me and you know the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
4936927 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4936928 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
4936929 some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
4936930 you know if youve got book sales of 25 million
4936931 theyre going to make a good decision and were going to be able to solve the big problems that we face
4936932 all i wanted to be was champion i already had the world record
4936933 just dont do only one it wont be as spectacular
4936934 why not make a great vacation spot in your own place that you can enjoy day in and day out
4936935 when people get home from a hard days work they can look out and see something beautiful in their yard
4936936 ive been in landscaping for over 20 years and ive always loved nature loved our mountains and loved plants
4936937 and i wanted to create our environment in peoples yards
4936938 in our house we have everything a kitchen a living room a bedroom
4936939 outdoors people just have a yard i figure in peoples yards they can have outdoor rooms with themes
4936940 you can have a joyful garden or a contemplating garden or a friendship garden
4936941 i think people get limited on what a garden can be but with a little creative direction they can create some great outdoor living spaces
4936942 bertie can i have a puppy oh please bertie i would so love to have a pet to play with
4936943 oh dear is there no end to the silly questions of little tadpoles you cant have a pet thats bigger than yourself if you had a puppy you would be the puppys pet or his breakfast
4936944 oh yes you can have a pet thats bigger than yourself
4936945 the queen once had a camel and that was even bigger than her majesty
4936946 well you cant have a pet thats big enough to eat you
4936947 and tim wouldnt even make a light snack for a puppy he would be like little morsel on the end of his tongue
4936948 oh yes you can have a pet thats big enough to eat you
4936949 when i was a prince i had a lion for a pet
4936950 because thats what im best at but this one happens to be true
4936951 ah yes maam a camel will that be one hump or two
4936952 of course maam i do so apologise right now we are out of camels but we do have all sorts of interesting animals fresh in from africa for instance we have handsome lion cub and a lion is rather more royal than a camel if you dont mind me saying so
4936953 you silly little man lions are for statues not pets
4936954 mummy mummy do lets have a lion cub i promise ill look after him all by myself honest i will ill keep him with me always and well be bestest friends
4936955 that cub of yours has become quite a lion hes already growing a mane its time he went to the zoo
4936956 you cant put tiddles behind bars and besides i love him you should think of my feelings too daddy
4936957 you had better get back into the car just come back slowly dont run if you run they will attack you
4936958 tiddles tiddles dont you remember me im bertie your best friend
4936959 im going to kiss that frog and maybe he will turn into a prince
4936960 my body has been making people laugh since i was a teenager
4936961 i hated the music but looking back on it rock and roll was fun back then
4936962 yeah i gained even less respect for them than i had previously
4936963 the musicians are in the front making music the drummer sits behind them and bangs on things like a baboon
4936964 when youve been drumming all night long and its 8 30 in the morning and youve been shooting since 4 30 p m the day before
4936965 its very sticky on the throne as they call it
4936966 they call it a modesty pouch it has a little drawstring its remarkably similar to the pouch i used to carry my multisided dungeons and dragons dice
4936967 and one geek that i think gets short shrift is the comedy geek i was the kind of kid who would sit with a tape recorder in front of the tv for the monty pythons that would play at midnight on sundays on pbs recording on a cassette id listen to it over and over again memorizing all the songs and sketches
4936968 my parents were bohemian hippie types who lived on a houseboat in seattle in the 60s
4936969 my mom wanted to name me thucydides after the greek historian my dad wanted to name me rainer after the poet rainer maria rilke my middle name is dietrich after dietrich fischer dieskau the opera singer somehow or other it ended up being rainn with two ns go figure
4936970 it sucked when i was in junior high school and getting made fun of and slapped around a little bit
4936971 but its worked out pretty well in my professional life its a name people remember
4936972 basically what happens with every comedy script in hollywood is its shipped off to will ferrell and jack black and ben stiller
4936973 if they all pass the studio goes ok now what the expletive do we do with this
4936974 my name was on a list of five people the studio would consider to do the movie with
4936975 i met with the producers and really responded to it i love the physical comedy and the silliness of it and the rock and roll
4936976 but i also love the fact that in this time of very dark r rated comedies its a sweet movie with an almost john hughes feel a curiously old fashioned feel good comedy
4936977 rainn brings an intensity to whatever he does that makes dwight ring like a smartly tapped bell
4936978 and for dwight he combines a number of traits from classic nerds to rural types into something that is pretty unique
4936979 you wouldnt believe the number of times i get the phrase you dont understand
4936980 people in hollywood always talk about likability i kind of feel thats bull
4936981 i think if you make a character specific really make him live and breathe people will get on board likability or not
4936982 if you can see the characters heart in some way even as warped as dwight schrutes is they will get on the train and millions have gotten on the dwight train

4936985 the first 360 degree barrel roll ever attempted in a simulator
4936986 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
4936987 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
4936988 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
4936989 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
4936990 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
4936991 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
4936992 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
4936993 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
4936994 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard

4937000 our lottery does not perform at 100 percent were making 3 billion on our lottery we could make 6 billion or 7 billion on our lottery other states make that amount of money
4937001 the trouble is the california lottery has never been run as if its a retail business and as a result it has not done well at all
4937002 we will do nothing that will infringe upon the compacts
4937003 the competition is going to be fierce to say the least
4937004 i am going to have to be as fast and strong and technically sound as i have ever been no part of this will be easy and that will make success more meaningful i am ready to get it started
4937005 knowing aarik what kind of competitor he is i know not to expect anything because hell go beyond what i expect each competition is different he can win the gold medal and two weeks later get fourth place if you start to expect things youre going to be disappointed well walk away with whatever happens
4937006 while i have been here the training has been similar to what i was doing in kansas
4937007 it is a balance of getting the work on the track and then at the same time not beating my stress fracture too much i have been two days on the track and one in the pool and then making sure to get a rest day in too
4937008 sports illustrated didnt have him ranked in the top three for medals thats the way he wants it now he gets to prove more people wrong and hes going to win the gold medal they dont need to put up a sign in fallon they need to put up a monument
4937009 a boy from las vegas jumps 47 9 and he points at aarik
4937010 youre talking about a 16 year old kid a sophomore and aarik gets on the runway and jumps and everyone knows its a big jump instead of whooping and hollering he gives me a big hug and jumps 48 6 and wins state
4937011 just seeing him in basketball he could jump like nobody else
4937012 i could see it coming hes a hard worker its exciting not surprising
4937013 knowing aarik and what kind of competitor he is i know not to expect anything because hell go beyond what i expect
4937014 ive learned over the years not to put specific distances on any competition because so many factors are involved in 2004 i thought he was going to jump a heck of a lot better than he did two weeks later if he jumped what he did he would have been fourth or fifth at the trials
4937015 gymnastics taught me a lot about body control inner strength and flexibility
4937016 it was amazing to me the things you can do to control your body
4937017 after two months she the head coach offered me her assistant coaching job
4937018 i said that id be happy to they took care of my tuition and i was kind of like a graduate assistant coach i jumped into gymnastics with both feet and she asked me if i wanted the job permanently
4937019 if it hadnt have been for the university of tennessee i probably wouldnt have applied and would have continued with gymnastics
4937020 tennessee was a national powerhouse i always felt more comfortable with track that was the hardest phone call i had to make telling those girls that i wasnt going to be their assistant coach next season it was hard for them
4937021 i saw some film of him before i started recruiting him
4937022 the first time i saw him in person competing in track was his freshman year coach paul orong or aarik sent me some film i just saw the video of him thats the one good thing about track and field the tape measure and stopwatch dont lie and thats the same for everybody
4937023 hes still got some things to work on to get better and jump farther its a building process a process thats been long but i dont think its over he may be able to set a world record or an american record
4937024 im truly grateful for what shes done and what aariks done
4937025 i had a girl make the team in 2004 and i didnt get to go to athens
4937026 the school was going to pay for me but my son was being born i would have hated to be in athens and miss the whole thing i was glad to be there for his birth

4937034 if somebody pushed me against the wall i could not argue persuasively that this is something we must do every night of the week
4937035 there isnt much of a story until the night the candidate does his acceptance speech
4937036 i would argue that we will spend a lot of money at the conventions that some of us would much rather see added to the pot of money we have to cover the campaign

4937041 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years

4937047 when i consider the pressure expectation and the attention that surrounded me at the time i honestly feel quite unwell

4937118 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4937119 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4937120 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4937121 kalau hendak muzakarah juga kita tanya mereka sebab apa tidak mahu menerima islam dalam semua aspek kehidupan termasuk ekonomi dan budaya kita kena tanya mereka di mana tidak kena islam sehingga umno tidak mahu menerimanya
4937122 hanya ini sahaja yang boleh kalau kita hendak muzakarah dengan umno
4937123 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
4937124 jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
4937125 saya pun hairan satu pihak hendak berunding dengan umno dan satu pihak lagi hendak perkukuhkan pakatan rakyat macam mana boleh berlaku sedemikian ini menggelirukan orang ramai
4937126 kalau umno tiada di muka dunia ini orang melayu pun tidak rosak di lima negeri yang dikuasai pakatan rakyat sekarang orang melayu pun boleh hidup juga
4937127 kalau kita sayangkan umno kita keluarkan mereka daripada kegelapan yang tua tua itu biarlah sudah payah begitu juga mereka yang mempunyai duit banyak biarlah
4937128 seperti juga kita payah hendak tebang pokok besar kecuali dengan cara kita buangkan dahulu ranting dahannya dan lama kelamaan pokok besar itu akan mati juga
4937129 cuma kita tumpulah kepada golongan muda dengan mengajak mereka kepada islam

4937148 i think its a 50 50 chance this could go into september
4937149 because some of us are not willing to balance the budget on the backs of children and republicans have not abandoned their cuts only approach
4937150 it all depends on what republicans are going to do whether theyre willing to compromise at all
4937151 or if theyre bound by their grover norquist pledge to demand a cuts only budget
4937152 the issues havent changed and theres not one iota of the two sides deviating from their positions the advertisement click here purpose of todays session is to show republicans are not cooperating
4937153 its time for reasonable people to come up with a compromise and produce a budget
4937154 a rainy day fund is a huge win for republicans
4937155 thats what they say they want were willing to work with them to figure out how we could get the votes to get it done im hopeful something could get done today but im prepared to continue negotiations with them until we have a budget that makes sense for all californians but were not going to accept their cuts only approach
4937156 because of the urgency of the situation but were dealing with a very intransigent and irresponsible minority we cant go any further than this any additional cuts would decimate education transportation environmental protection
4937157 they feel if they make it really bad republicans will have to cave
4937158 but our caucus is unified the only frustration is we didnt do this have a vote on the budget six weeks ago because thats usually the point where everybody starts rolling up their sleeves and negotiating
4937159 we want people to understand that were not holding out for the sake of holding out
4937160 were trying to protect seniors education and all the things democrats care about
4937161 i dont know who championed the idea specifically but obviously when you are talking about the preservation of the yampa and green rivers that 1938 presidential proclamation was huge
4937162 from what i understand the stories and movies that came out of the early river trips helped introduce people to the joys of river running and specifically river running in dinosaur
4937163 i believe that the denver post expedition had to have part of the inspiration for guys like bus hatch who had some ideas on how to make it easier those kinds of expeditions show these incredible places to the world and people want to play there
4937164 it seems like the numbers we have going down there are appropriate for the resource and providing a wilderness sort of experience on a river
4937165 a lot of it is based on available campsites because the area is so rich in archaeological history and there are so many cultural resources out there
4937166 its my opinion that the park was really saved by the rafters and notoriety they brought it at that time
4937167 there was a tremendous amount of publicity at that time going down the river just became the thing to do
4937168 i think water is going to become one of the driving issues across the entire west and certainly one of our biggest concerns for the park i do think the dam proposal is a huge threat to the park right now
4937169 we already have flaming gorge dam upstream on the green the free flowing yampa and the area below the confluence within the monument boundary so right now dinosaur is an incredible lab to determine the impact dams have on rivers
4937170 a really great pbs show that only 12 people saw
4937171 there arent hundreds of thousands of advocates out there because only a few thousand people can visit a year
4937172 its sort of a catch 22 you dont want to open it up and turn it into disneyland but unless people know about it they wont know how important it is to protect
4937173 the reason why i was so emotional is that i have dreamed of a lot of things and written things down
4937174 this was the biggest thing i have ever written down thinking of all the things i have done to get here everything i have gone through
4937175 my mom and i still joke about the fact i had a middle school teacher who said i would never be successful
4937176 i saw my mom for a minute and we hugged she started crying i started crying my sister started crying
4937177 what impresses me the most is his comments in the press conference and how he expresses himself
4937178 i have seen him swim some good meets and some fast times but i think he has a better grasp of what this means to the world not just the swimming world and i think that is a great thing to see
4937179 for a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god but woman is the glory of man
4937180 i permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men she is to keep silent

4937200 the articulation of the rising global imaginary as market globalism fell mainly to the global elites composed of corporate managers executives of large tncs corporate lobbyists high level military officers journalists and public relations specialists intellectuals writing to large audiences state bureaucrats and politicians
4937201 the globalist rendition of hayeks spontaneous self regulating market order buttresses friedmans larger argument that globalization does not reflect the arbitrary agenda of a particular social class or group
4937202 the assumed affinity between democracy and free markets hinges on a definition of democracy that emphasizes formal procedures such as voting at the expense of the direct participation of broad majorities in political and economic decision making
4937203 social activists around the world began to engage in what social movement expert sidney tarrow calls
4937204 the ideological edifice of jihadist globalism rests on the public evocation of an exceptional crisis the umma has been subjected to an unprecedented wave of attacks on its territories values and economic resources
4937205 the conviction that american foreign policy must reflect the deepest values of democratic societies and that american power has been and could be used for moral purposes the notion that the united states needs to remain engaged in international affairs and as the worlds dominant power it has a special responsibility for global security a fervent belief in free markets and free trade coupled with a strong distrust of
4937206 heavy doses of spiritual and religious thought from affiliated environmentalists and peace activists

4937211 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4937212 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4937213 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4937214 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4937215 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4937216 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4937217 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4937218 words cannot put any kind of meaning on it job done
4937219 thats the time that it hit home that we have done something pretty special
4937220 you cannot describe what sarah and i have been through for the last four years and two for pippa
4937221 we feel very sorry for what happened after investigating the cause of the accident we would like to decide whether to hold the annual fireworks show next year and after
4937222 but only after the child had touched it furthermore whats the idea of seating a family with a small child so close to the smoking section cant you understand people wanting to protect their children
4937223 i think you should shave a little off the bill
4937224 here ive just been dumped by my significant other and i have to put up with people going chu chu a japanese word mimicking the sound of kissing right in front of me everywhere i go
4937225 its picturesque when mona yamamoto a scandal tainted tv personality does it with a hunky democratic party of japan politician
4937226 but when ordinary people do it then its simply disgusting
4937227 it infuriates me to see a dog dressed for a walk in a t shirt or polo shirt at the height of summer
4937228 we have two daughters and an adorable dog whos just as cute as the girls
4937229 so we dress the dog in cute clothes same as the kids a dog may not understand language but it understands love if you make the effort to communicate it why is that a crime
4937230 when you step into that hoop and start spinning around you create your own little world
4937231 reach out and touch the blue whales skin its springy and smooth like a hard boiled egg and its as slippery as wet soap
4937232 i gave a speech in fourth grade about how i wanted to be a librarian
4937233 its the only thing i ever actually wanted to do
4937234 there are so many distractions these days but theres nothing like a book for certain kinds of brain development the ability to think the ability to reason the ability to imagine and picture things and follow a complex thought the ability to speak those things really require reading
4937235 schools are very intent on teaching kids the mechanics of reading which is great because you need to know those kinds of things
4937236 but the librarys job is to make it really fun and to have such a great variety of materials that you can find anything youre interested in
4937237 how do you make it compelling when kids are used to multi million dollar productions
4937238 what i came up with is that you go ahead with making it casual and making it fun but make it human and involving
4937239 but they arent saying to themselves that production values arent good because theyre in it
4937240 if i send them home with a sense that we could do that we could act something out then i feel like they have gained some real skills
4937241 its a simple thing the kids like it it costs almost nothing and it gets away from that comparison with things i cant compare with
4937242 i really appreciate when they have programs for the kids
4937243 my daughter loves to act shes always excited for the plays i dont remember anything like that when i was a kid
4937244 if the parents didnt do a lot of going to the library when they were kids or theyre super busy having a reason to come to the library becomes really important
4937245 once theyre in there then we can say look what else you can get

4937261 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
4937262 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
4937263 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
4937264 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
4937265 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
4937266 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
4937267 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
4937268 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
4937269 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
4937270 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough
4937271 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg
4937272 i was going to get to the finish line no matter what because that was my race
4937273 i really wanted to get a medal but it was a really good field so i am pretty happy with sixth
4937274 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but i can do it in 2012 if my body holds together
4937275 i think everybody on the planet has been trying to give him some kind of obstacle
4937276 were trying to hes kind of crossed the bridge and taken swimming to the next level
4937277 people can question all they want but the facts are the facts ive got the results to prove it
4937278 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
4937279 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
4937280 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
4937281 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
4937282 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
4937283 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
4937284 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man

4937290 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
4937291 man here we go again prepare for a whole new stellar webpage of old posts from my blog and some hullarious new pics from my facebook account
4937292 and they are hullarious barely a week goes by at uni without a themed party or whatever
4937293 still such japes and laughter are specially reserved for those to whom i deem the honour of labelling my friends not old nazi tosspots who have a homoerotic obsession you wish regarding pics of me with my shirt off of which there certainly is no fucking shortage i tells ya
4937294 i guess well have to pull agent chinchilla mathew henderson out from deep cover interesting that he is claiming that this person is working for fdb and run some hullarious pics of these blokes complete with some very dirty cybersex conversations
4937295 yes final exams are three weeks off but im so up for this one
4937296 as i stated previously no skin off my nose to keep filing dcmas and yanking pics but the blog has pissed off some friends of mine who are well connected were talking retired qcs and shit
4937297 campbell mate you want my honest opinion now this is buttressed by former kids names please who he hung out with in the old wpca days telling us that the guy is pretty much a tortured closet homo hahahahahahha i can only pick that from some of the twisted crap he writes and the lurid descriptions he provides of the male form but people have told us about some very creeped out evenings hmmm strange days indeed theyve had driving around with him
4937298 so essentially youre dealing with two of lifes classic losers
4937299 obwohl sich beim web 2 0 jetzt langsam etwas ern chterung einstellt wird es den n chsten zwei jahren eine marktumw lzende bedeutung erreichen denn immer mehr unternehmen machen zurzeit erfahrungen mit den technologischen und unternehmenskulturellen auswirkungen von web 2 0
4937300 die business angels szene in deutschland ist noch deutlich unterentwickelt
4937301 is one of the first observations from about coms page on being a home buyer in a falling market of course youve got a lot of things to consider including how much you might lose by selling your current house just to snap up a bargain
4937302 dont be shocked if you hear throw in that plasma tv and weve got a deal
4937303 it turns out the chinese faked part of the opening ceremonies they made the fireworks look more lively its the same technology they use for john mccain
4937304 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact banging his videographer
4937305 you know bush really is adorable he shouldnt be our president he should be our mascot
4937306 barack obama said today he wouldnt raise taxes on anyone over 70 and mccain said obama was just pandering to the youth vote
4937307 now we move to our anti olympic update russia has taken a commanding lead over georgia trouncing the former soviet satellite 10 000 bombs to one
4937308 john mccain has been accused of stealing policy ideas from wikipedia which is ridiculous everybody knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
4937309 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets congressional quarterly reported this week that john mccain may have copied some facts in a recent speech on the georgian crisis from wikipedia i think it should have been obvious when he referred to the countrys leader as president 404 error file not found
4937310 now i think mccain getting his facts from wikipedia is great news wikipedia gets its facts from the american people which means mccain is now using the peoples voice or at least lip synching to it plus the internet can be a creepy place but its a lot less creepy than mccains previous source of foreign policy information joe lieberman ironically lieberman often needs similar help when he gets confused about the difference between republicans and democrats
4937311 and im still searching for a video editing solution in foss something that can replace imovie and final cut so far cinelerra looks like the best choice but im unconvinced and still looking

4937336 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4937337 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4937338 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4937339 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4937340 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4937341 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4937342 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4937343 he wants a role in the countrys politics after leaving the presidency
4937344 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue be settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4937345 the impeachment process which can last months will be very damaging especially for the countrys economy
4937346 the purpose of these talks is to settle the issue and there are many other options under consideration

4937350 in one blow russia has managed to do something it had not done for years which is to assert its role as the regional security manager after seeing that role dissipate from the mid 1990s
4937351 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4937352 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes
4937353 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4937354 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that
4937355 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
4937356 i would say it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
4937357 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisation to launch military operations issues of sovereignty

4937360 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me obama said
4937361 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage mccain said
4937362 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4937363 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade obama said
4937364 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies

4937416 the moscow times appeared in russia when i started my career as a lawyer
4937417 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4937418 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4937426 the clerestory windows allow for borrowed light from the large skylight we wanted privacy but we didnt want to sacrifice light
4937427 it is as if we have two upside down us like croquet wickets of blackened steel that weve pulled apart to create the working part of the kitchen
4937428 in the northwest we cant have them outside this is what we do instead
4937429 i dont think things have to be either open or closed they can be open and closed
4937430 you dont feel like the kitchen is totally open to the other room but it can still engage the room
4937431 the advantage to this is you dont have to do pulls or edge bindings
4937432 broom closet linens for when they go to costco like a hidden pantry
4937433 there are five pocket doors in this house to make it totally convertible there is a pocket door between the master hallway and the courtyard at the bathroom bedroom and the other two are on the front side and provide the privacy barrier between the spaces facing the street and the courtyard
4937434 multifunctional space thats whats really important instead of megamansions why cant we just get more function out of our space we should be designing multifunctional spaces that are convertible and work for different times of day and different functions in our life
4937435 i told john that id love a kitchen id love a living room id love a bathroom

4937440 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4937441 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4937442 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4937443 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4937444 whats my secret i may look tough on the outside but really i scream like a girl
4937445 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4937446 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4937447 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4937448 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4937449 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4937450 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4937451 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4937452 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4937457 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4937458 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4937459 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4937460 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4937461 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4937462 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4937463 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4937464 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4937465 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4937466 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4937467 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4937468 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4937469 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4937475 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4937476 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4937477 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
4937478 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
4937479 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
4937480 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines

4937495 because i love pigs and pigs are the most misunderstood animals
4937496 we get people who believe in what this is all about and in teaching people theres a different way to live and that would mean not eating them
4937497 theres nothing in the world cuter than a little pig baby
4937498 they are so darn engaging and cute and they kiss you and people want them to stay tiny
4937499 pigs raised in confinement on concrete are not happy animals
4937500 at the same time most of them are not nasty at all theyre pretty intelligent
4937501 is what pigs are like they have a social structure and spend their day roaming about they dont like to eat garbage anymore than you or i like it
4937502 now the shelters wont take them someone living in an apartment has no business getting a pig as a baby what are they thinking
4937503 you can lecture people and they dont want to hear it but if you show them in a kind way that this is the way i live my life and its the most compassionate way to live if you say you love animals then you can get them i try to live by example

4937515 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4937516 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4937517 earlier this year i along with dragan huterer at the university of chicago and kate jones smith of case western reserve university calculated that even if 3000 supernova observations were made with a measurement accuracy slightly better than anything that has been possible thus far then the constraints on the measured value might improve by at most a factor of 2 once the theoretical uncertainty in w is incorporated
4937518 but let us say for the sake of argument that the true value of the equation of state parameter is w 0 96 then even if we are able to improve the existing uncertainty in w by a factor of 10 using a variety of proposed techniques beyond simply measuring distant supernovae a value of w 1 will only be two standard deviations away from the best fit value which may not even correspond to w 0 96 unfortunately such confidence intervals occur routinely in physics and while suggestive are not sufficient to claim a discovery as readers know there is a theory three truly independent experiments type ia supernovae lunar laser ranging and the faint young sun

4937521 holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned
4937522 do not overrate what you have recieved nor envy others he who envies others does not obtain peace of mind
4937523 believe nothing no matter where you read it or who said it no matter if i have said it unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense
4937524 he who experiences unity of life sees his own self in all beings and all beings in his own self and looks on everything with an impartial eye
4937525 expose yourself to your deepest fear after that fear has no power and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes you are free
4937526 i am interested in anything about revolt disorder chaos especially activity that seems to have no meaning it seems to me to be the road toward freedom
4937527 people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over yeah i guess it is a friend
4937528 the most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are you trade in your reality for a role you give up your ability to feel and in exchange put on a mask
4937529 the most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on their faces they force us to destroy the person we really are a subtle kind of murder
4937530 this scripture speaks of the blood of animals which were sacrificed to temporarily cover the sins of the people in the old testament until the messiah would come and offer the perfect sacrifice of himself to god the father
4937531 jesus blood didnt atone for our sins but rather took them away forever
4937532 jesus blood applied to the mercy seat in heaven is all sufficient jesus only needed to offer himself as a sacrifice
4937533 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins
4937534 jesus death was just as important as his blood sacrifice and equally important the burial and resurrection but everything concerning the events of jesus life were leading up to the blood being applied in heaven
4937535 john 3 16 the reason why we are to trust christ alone for salvation is because of the blood that he shed for our sins only jesus has the nail scared hands and feet no one else salvation is found only in jesus christ acts 4 10 12 john 14 6 because take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood
4937536 but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us
4937537 for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god

4937539 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4937540 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4937541 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4937546 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4937547 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4937548 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4937549 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4937550 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4937551 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4937552 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4937553 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4937554 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4937555 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4937556 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4937557 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4937558 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4937559 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4937560 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4937561 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4937562 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4937563 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4937564 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4937565 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4937566 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4937567 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4937568 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4937569 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4937570 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4937592 at the age of 23 it took michael phelps just five days in beijing to surpass american track star carl lewis american swimmer mark spitz soviet gymnast larysa latynina and finnish runner paavo nurmi to become the winningest olympian in history
4937593 american swimmer michael phelps claimed his eighth gold medal at the beijing olympics on sunday to become the most prolific athlete in one olympic games and also the most successful athlete with 14 golds in the olympic history
4937594 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
4937595 phelps is now one of a kind breaking mark spitz s record of seven gold medals in swimming in munich in 1972 no other olympian has ever won eight or seven in a single games he has 14 career gold medals also a record phelps the tall man from baltimore did it with some theatrics in earlier races including a desperate extra lunge in the 100 butterfly final saturday one of the great finishes in any olympic event ever given the stakes

4937599 not to promote the products and services they provide but about finding and growing their companies
4937600 whats happening is the taxpayers are under assault like weve never seen before
4937601 we have not seen an assault on taxpayers of this magnitude since the tax revolt leading up to prop 13 three decades ago
4937602 our elected leadership at both the state and local levels is pushing california into the coveted position of the highest tax state in america if that happens it will be economic suicide for the golden state
4937603 the president says we are addicted to oil and yet we are feeding that addiction rather than pushing for newer technologies that can wean us away from that
4937604 theyve got all the information in their files right now and they could start the minute the sierra club shuts up
4937605 ive been called everything from a son of a bitch to a liar
4937606 all that crap you just have to smile we got the permits but it aint pretty
4937607 some people dont like to see a drilling rig operating out there but it looks great to me
4937608 because the price of crude is up the engineers and geologists have developed a backlog of potential wells to drill
4937609 these are tiny little projects inside huge companies and they dont get the attention they deserve
4937610 we look at old orphaned assets and we redevelop them
4937611 we came up with a phased approach of returning eureka to production
4937612 since it had been so long since it had been on you had to show you could still produce it and get some money flowing to pay for the other phases

4937617 if somebody pushed me against the wall i could not argue persuasively that this is something we must do every night of the week
4937618 there isnt much of a story until the night the candidate does his acceptance speech
4937619 i would argue that we will spend a lot of money at the conventions that some of us would much rather see added to the pot of money we have to cover the campaign
4937620 this is when the deal gets to be closed and its the beginning of the shared national experience that ends in november
4937621 they want to send a message to the business community that theyre going to play hardball on this
4937622 we have a pretty rickety national economy and what we need to do is come together
4937623 its fair to say that colorado will be the center of ballot initiative world in november
4937624 the business labor ones likely will be the biggest most bitter and hard fought ballot fight in the country
4937625 coloradans appreciate and love their freedoms and thats the main thrust of amendment 47
4937626 if people break the law they should be held responsible
4937627 this isnt the focus what most das are doing today
4937628 youre not making colorado a very attractive place to do business
4937629 completely consistent with his record of supporting our allies in a very tough region of the world
4937630 hes been a leader on this issue for a very long time
4937631 this little country was prospering its a democracy its a freely elected government
4937632 what were seeing now is a gross violation of everything we stand for and believe in
4937633 but this one is really brazen theres been an exchange of money when hes been advising mccain to take some action
4937634 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4937635 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4937636 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4937637 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4937638 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4937639 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4937640 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4937641 its a time when each of us is called to do whatever we can as individuals to make a statement large and small
4937642 its time for our generation to stand up for our brothers and sisters being murdered
4937643 we want to hear that somebody thinks the integrity of the national boundaries is meaningful and necessary
4937644 i dont think were going to hear it from either one of them
4937645 the obama camp doesnt want to seem as if theyre trying to shove the clintons out of the way that theyre trying to do like the old soviet union and destroy all the statues
4937646 there was no expectation that this guy was going to be a tv guy
4937647 others who are in the space tend to draw more attention to themselves than chuck does
4937648 im really trying to make sure i never go on the air when i have nothing to talk about
4937649 i want to make sure that the people who do pay attention to what i say they feel like they learn something every time
4937650 this campaign coverage has really bounced from controversy to controversy gaffe pingpong
4937651 and that is very much how cable tends to operate
4937652 cable really has replaced broadcast for convention coverage and real political debate and discussion
4937653 the people who know anything about the vice presidential process on our campaign are not talking about it
4937654 it has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds
4937655 the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism healthcare energy
4937656 i have yet to wait on a line at this grocery and the girls at the register are always so quick and pleasant

4937665 the issue of kirkuk is very clear there is a constitution http krp org htmlfragments documents asplngnr 12 amp fnr 24 amp rnr 272smap 02030000 approved by the majority of the people of iraq there is article 140 in this constitution related to kirkuk article 140 of the constitution will not be cancelled until all its provisions are implemented
4937666 we believe that the kurdistan region is a region for all kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
4937667 this resolution of the current conflict is first and foremost the responsibility of the people of kirkuk outsiders can only have a helping role however i think there are some external people who are trying to manipulate this internal process to determine the fate of kirkuk for their own ends

4937678 provides a novel means for sensing the level of infrared radiation received by the vegetation from a skyward direction
4937679 infrared thermometers with bandpass filters from 8 to 13 can be used to measure the real temperature of vegetal surfaces with errors in the range of 0 1c to 0 3c to do this the emissivity must be either known or determined and a correction accounting for the reflected radiation from the surroundings must be made
4937680 the apparent radiative temperature may differ as much as 2c from the real temperature

4937687 marketing to existing customers presents a ripe opportunity that too many marketers overlook
4937688 innovation has lagged in this area but with these new techniques and improved technology marketers need to take advantage of these tools to keep their customers loyal and to remain competitive and profitable in todays fast paced marketplace
4937689 however it is important for taxpayers to be educated on the irs and their collection agencies when dealing with owed back taxes
4937690 for many individuals who owe back taxes to the irs the culprit behind the tax debt is the estimated tax payment
4937691 have you ever dealt with an irs representative who is less than helpful this is a frustrating predicament for taxpayers that just want to put their irs tax debt behind them so they can move on with their lives however it is easy to forget that the irs is staffed by human beings with all the common foibles of ordinary people even though they may not always demonstrate them openly irs representatives often allow their own emotions and personal problems to creep into their work furthermore irs employees have varying levels of competency and skill if you have been working with the irs to settle your tax liabilities and feel that you have been treated unfairly or incompetently you may want to request the assistance of the taxpayer advocate service the taxpayer advocate service tas describes itself as an independent organization within the irs the service is free but not everyone who owes back taxes will qualify for tas assistance a taxpayer normally must be experiencing some kind of economic burden or delay imposed by the irs if you believe that you fit this criteria or if you believe that an irs procedure is just not functioning properly you may want to consult with the tas by calling 1 877 777 4778 you will need to give them your basic contact information and describe to them the actions you have taken to try to resolve your tax debt if they decide that they can help you will be given a case number and you will be contacted by your assigned case advocate usually within a week or so the individual case advocate will work as a mediator between you and the irs
4937692 the irs offers three 3 different payment options when it comes to the offer in compromise 1 lump sum cash offer 2 short term periodic payment offer 3 deferred periodic payment offer however the difference in these payment options is not solely the difference in how the offer in compromise is to be paid rather each payment option actually impacts the total amount the taxpayer will pay to the irs
4937693 the internal revenue service irs has implemented procedures for taxpayers to request a reimbursement of the fees charged by a bank against a taxpayer for processing a bank levy when the bank levy was issued erroneously by the irs reimbursements are limited to 1 000 00 and must be claimed within one year of being incurred as you may know the irs has the right to issue a bank levy on an account that bears the name of a taxpayer who owes irs back taxes a notice of levy is sent to the taxpayers bank and it attaches to all accounts in the name of the taxpayer whether a sole or joint account the bank is then legally obligated to honor the irs levy that freezes the funds on deposit in the account the bank cannot allow anyone access to the frozen funds for 21 days from the date of receipt of the levy this holding period allows time to resolve any issues about account ownership and collectability after the 21 days have elapsed the bank must send the money plus interest if it applies to the irs if the levy has not been successfully released
4937694 i am black change the world and over throw the white power hungry demons currently controlling your lives
4937695 i am old and white vote for me because i am not black and need to win because i probably wont be alive the next election term
4937696 i over the years have taken a very strong stand on drug issues but in light of the tremendous growth of government power since 9 11 it has forced me and other conservatives to go back and take a renewed look at how big and powerful we want the government to be in peoples lives

4937701 the freedom to create is inhibited by his two first requirements clarity and credibility
4937702 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4937703 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
4937704 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
4937705 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
4937706 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4937707 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
4937708 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
4937709 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
4937710 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
4937711 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
4937712 the ironic thing about prince charless comments is that one of the mitigating factors in controlling salinity may well be gm crops which are being developed with the problem in mind

4937755 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4937756 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4937757 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4937758 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4937759 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4937760 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4937761 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4937762 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

4937768 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4937769 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4937770 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4937771 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4937772 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4937773 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4937774 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4937775 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4937776 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4937777 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4937778 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4937779 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4937780 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4937781 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4937782 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4937783 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4937784 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4937785 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4937786 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4937787 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4937788 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

4937792 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4937793 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4937794 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4937795 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4937796 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4937797 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4937798 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

4937804 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios

4937823 since the court maintained the fine the pcb cannot allow him to play for pakistan as it would be tantamount to flouting the ruling of the court
4937824 he lawson came to the meeting with a list of players he thought should play for pakistan in the champions trophy
4937825 when he was told by the selectors that they would review his list and would also consult with the pcb before naming the national team lawson lost his cool he told the selectors what now you will discuss my team in an angry tone and was immediately told to behave

4937841 the dalai lama has taken the kind of courageous step that great political leaders make at crucial turning points in history
4937842 after more than 20 years of stalemate the dalai lama at great risk to his standing in the west and among tibetans in exile has unilaterally sent beijing a clear signal that he is now ready to accept the kind of difficult compromises that are needed to resolve the conflict
4937843 for the first time in decades reconciliation is now genuinely possible
4937844 our position and policy on the tibet related issue is clear and persistent we should not only take into account what the dalai lama said but what he has done we need to see concrete action
4937845 gtreks google earth capabilities are a great conversation maker after a days exercise not only can you see an overhead view of where youve traveled but if in a competitive group like we were the numerical information is perfect to settle any argument

4937847 i was pretty sure that if i won it i would be the first player ever to do the wsop macau festival plo double a feat that in all probability will never be repeated or possibly even attempted again
4937848 i got very lucky in a couple of pots where i was drawing very thin indeed
4937849 one of which was against jeff duval again when i called his turn bet with bottom
4937850 however there was still the small matter of deciding the trophy we decided to go all in blind next hand and the winner would get the trophy regardless of what their chip stack had been before the hand and in keeping with the ridiculous run of form that ive been on of late they were all drawing dead on the turn and i had another trophy to add to my recent haul
4937851 botswana is a sovereign state and has a right to take whatever decision it deems fit

4937856 extremely sad and at the same time maddening here was a woman who gave kean university almost 40 years of her life helping thousands of disadvantaged students achieve the dream of graduating from college who was stripped of her reputation her dignity and her means of supporting herself for no legitimate reason we think the taxpayers of this state should be outraged at how this publicly funded university apparently operates
4937857 our family toured the wine regions of napa sonoma and the mid coast of california as well as tuscany in italy and the rhine river valley in germany
4937858 we went to many inns and wineries and brought back the best ideas from each region
4937859 we wanted these buildings to look like they belong here and we think the architects have done a wonderful job of giving a current interpretation to the victorian farmhouse look
4937860 last years debate was also on logistics and the environment at a time when the logistics industry was unsure how to move forward i concluded the government needed to think of long term infrastructure and the logistics industry needed to focus on delivering continued increased efficiencies and seeking ways to gain environmental efficiencies through supply chain collaboration
4937861 logistics is not the worst offender by any means but we are very visible to the general public and lobby groups we must do our very best and keep focused to achieve whatever improvement we can
4937862 by introducing greater capacity vehicles we saved 10 million kms annually we have also gained benefits from improved engine specs including 60 vehicles running on compressed natural gas transport collaboration with supply chain partners saved 650 000 kms in 2007 and already 450 000 kms in the first half of 2008
4937863 we must be sure that environmental improvement measurements are such that we can demonstrate improvements while delivering better service at same or lower costs
4937864 this might show they are trying to do something positive but little else the second put time and effort into gathering the total detail to get a database of information which can be used to identify changes in each area of the supply chain
4937865 are manufacturers likely to reverse recent decisions to make products in eastern european countries or the far east to save on carbon emissions will retailers be prepared to cut their margins and buy their goods closer to home
4937866 we see the power of innovation more efficient operations less empty running co2 per tonne kilometre down but are absolute uk emissions falling but it is partly as a result of developments like off shoring and sabotage
4937867 in the food supply chain food transport is responsible for just 2 5 3 5 of total uk green house gas emissions but the meat and dairy industry generates 8 maybe the future is not one of incremental efficiency gains there will be radical reconfiguring of how people get their food these are just possible futures but they could come true
4937868 will todays dcs configurations hold up in these alternative worlds the local sector is characterised by low tech penetration and small half loaded vehicles but what if everything were local what ethical expectations will consumers have what will logistics operators do without big stores what does efficiency look like in this world is efficiency a reality or a pipedream then
4937869 public opinion and the media traditionally associate logistics with high green house gas emissions however recent carbon footprint lifecycle assessments on products such as beer crisps and smoothies showed that the distribution element of the total footprint was only around 10 although we are working towards targets set on the continent the uk market places higher environmental demands than any other market in europe
4937870 sharing resources is core to our business so multi user warehouses and transport networks with their associated environmental benefits are at the heart of our culture collaboration with our customers and suppliers remains instrumental in the development and achievement of environmental goals
4937871 the current costs of fuel intensify the pressure to find ways to use resources more sparingly the logistics industry is environmentally efficient logistics providers have a contribution to make towards environmentally efficient supply chains and we should do so this is our bread amp butter
4937872 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
4937873 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
4937874 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
4937875 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you
4937876 we did an extensive search to find the right package
4937877 ccl container was the only company that met our requirements in terms of package aesthetics and recyclability and they worked with us very closely to overcome the many challenges associated with a new product launch
4937878 aluminum has the highest recycling rate of any beverage packaging material
4937879 we set out to make m13 the functional beverage brand of choice for discerning consumers and our aluminum bottles have helped us achieve that positioning we like the look and feel of matte finish aluminum and it has given our brand a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace
4937880 we kept pushing the envelope in order to produce the most distinctive package possible ccls technical team never lost patience they came up with creative solutions to meet our particular package requirements at every turn
4937881 we feel our packaging is and will continue to be an integral part of m13s success
4937882 feedback so far has been extremely favorable people tell us they like the clean utilitarian look and the matte finish weve even been invited to enter the bottle in a global packaging design competition
4937883 76 1 of respondents could recall the advertisers name on a promotional product that they had received in the past 12 months in addition 75 4 of respondents said they kept their promotional product because it was useful
4937884 when you are 25 or 30 retirement seems like a long time away but if people begin to save even a relatively modest amount they can look forward to a much more comfortable retirement
4937885 during the past 12 months the cost of basics such as food petrol and utility bills has dramatically increased but with household budgets feeling squeezed there is a danger that pension contributions might be delayed or suspended as people focus on the short term rather than the long term to ease the cost of everyday living however delaying your pension contributions can be very expensive
4937886 i cant stress highly enough that the early contributions are the most valuable ones as they enjoy the longest period of investment growth
4937887 after an exhaustive international search gala is delighted to welcome james as our first executive director
4937888 his extensive background in association management combined with his experience in international business will be invaluable as we serve more members and continue to build awareness of the fast growing language services and technology industry

4937890 there is no question that driving without insurance is both unlawful and ill advised
4937891 if you are worried about the cost of insurance it is worth talking to your insurance provider to check whether there are any savings to be made at rias for example we specialise in finding tailored insurance solutions for the over 50s who can often benefit from cheaper premiums because of low mileage or because their cars are parked off road or kept in a garage we advise customers to ensure they ask about discounts and flexible payment plans when they call us for a quote
4937892 we are extremely pleased to receive this award especially given that historically the co operative insurance has always been seen as primarily a home service provider we have invested heavily in our direct service propositions in order to ensure that we provide our customers with a clear choice on how they wish to transact business with us to have been voted best online motor insurance provider ahead of many of our major competitors is even more rewarding
4937893 it takes most people who tour with us about five minutes to become completely comfortable on the segway
4937894 we start with a short training video and then practice in the large courtyard in front of our store to make sure everyone is comfortable before the tour starts
4937895 it was the highlight of the whole trip we had an excellent time none of us had ever been on a segway before and my 60 year old mother was terrified that she would fall but she got the hang of it in no time and was an old pro by the time the tour was over
4937896 growing bolder is a philosophy a celebration of people who believe its all about attitude not about age
4937897 we are thrilled to receive the recognition for our hard work but the truth is the people who make up our community are the true visionaries and we accept this award on their behalf
4937898 there are so many issues were dealing with in senior circles a lot of challenges its good to bring us together because we recognize the seniors and the senior organizations that are working to answer the problems
4937899 immediately growing bolder came to my mind because i cant think of anybody else who is doing what theyre doing for seniors
4937900 i just think its very important for people in the community to hear how many seniors are giving back and continuing to do things into their retirement years or even up into their 90s
4937901 forexrebater com was launched to revolutionize forex market and help traders that work so hard reduce costs of forex trading
4937902 the idea of insurance is to protect people from catastrophic costs
4937903 at some point people arent going to consider themselves insured if theyre at risk for a huge amount out of pocket just because they have one disease rather than another
4937904 the reality is that this is where the pharmaceutical industry is focusing their research
4937905 the costs might be out of the ballpark but in the past without that drug the person might not be living or not living any type of quality of life
4937906 it gets to the fundamental question of what is insurance
4937907 at some point in our lives we may all join that small pool of users of high cost care
4937908 if i end up having to pay for those last two infusions i would have to file for bankruptcy
4937909 they want to keep employees and be good employers but there is a lot of pressure on the cost of health care right now
4937910 were trying to make sure that the benefit is kept affordable for the other 1 000 employees in the company
4937911 is a drug that costs 100 times more 100 times better
4937912 today we dont know because there is no independent entity that makes those comparisons
4937913 these tiering policies dont accomplish that they just stick it to the chronically ill
4937914 we have to recognize that we can only spend so much on health care
4937915 what are the options other than turn off the lights and say goodbye
4937916 in some instances manufacturers are charging exorbitant prices for single source drugs and prices keep increasing dramatically
4937917 i ask you how could the wealthiest nation in the world allow their disabled to go without medications specifically designed to promote their quality of life
4937918 this is going to go on until the day i die
4937919 ill be this 90 year old lady fighting for her copaxone
4937920 i feel that my business demonstrates my love for god and jesus by offering reasonable prices for bibles
4937921 providing bibles is a way to let people know my true character if i have a customer who needs something that i do not have listed i will try my best to locate it for him or her

4937936 we have a dog of our own that were very much in love with
4937937 my thought process was that dogs need lots of things such as a safe place to live after spending considerable time at dog shows veterinarians and grooming facilities i decided that one of the products i would like to represent is the doghouse
4937938 i will use the blog as an informational item to share with people who are interested in dogs
4937939 dog health issues the sizes the foods things of that nature the things that will serve the dog owner well in terms of the maintenance and care of their dogs
4937940 my future plan is to continue to build on the quality world class service and to continue searching the market to provide new products
4937941 we are in the midst of a major update of the site the next major update will feature an insulated doghouse
4937942 the biggest mistake people make is not communicating with their lending institution as soon as they recognize their ability to make the payments is threatened
4937943 people need to begin tracking their income and expenses closely and if needed seek help from a financial counselor to develop a workable budget or spending plan
4937944 i had been thinking about starting my own business for quite some time
4937945 it was just logical to do an online business as a person who has been shopping online for quite a few years i find it convenient and far more efficient than driving to different locations
4937946 it was a beautiful locket that people have been commenting on
4937947 i wear it everyday and they wanted to know where i got it i decided that those gifts would be my focus to be able to provide the same opportunity for others to obtain treasures is something i hold dear to my heart
4937948 we will be discussing the proper care of jewelry on the blog
4937949 as well as the history of charms and other items of interest we will also be doing research on such things as birthstones and myths
4937950 i believe that if you can do something to make someones day a little brighter its what you must do
4937951 every little bit helps and i try to encourage others to do the same
4937952 as for the financial industry its yet another sign that the worst is not over banks are the stingiest ever because they went overboard during the housing bubble leaving them vulnerable to large losses on previously issued home mortgages unfolding downturns in other sectors like autos and commercial real estate are starting to drive up delinquencies in other parts of their loan portfolios too
4937953 how federal regulators lenders and wall street created americas housing crisis nine proposals for a long term recovery
4937954 i like everything what has to do with fashion but especially in handbags because thats were most of the womens focus lies
4937955 the handbags complete the fashion look giving you style and class and most of the women cant afford the original designer handbags thats why my focus went into first class replica handbags
4937956 i chose the most desired brands on the market such as chanel louis vuitton versace and coach among others i would like to think that every woman whether shes a fashion guru business woman or a stay at home mom can find a high quality replica that fits her style without spending thousands of dollars
4937957 with the blog i can bring ideas tips news and discussions
4937958 the blog gives me the opportunity to keep in touch with my customers knowing what they feel about fashion it can also help improve my site by giving the customers the opportunity to express themselves
4937959 i have two grandchildren and a lot of friends who have been having babies and ive been invited to several baby showers and wanted to give them baby gifts
4937960 i was going from store to store to find quality items and was going from place to place to find personalized gifts i wasnt able to find anything i was happy with so i decided to start my own business
4937961 i wanted quality products i wanted them to be unique and i wanted them to be able to be personalized
4937962 i did a lot of searching before i decided on which products i wanted
4937963 i was a mother a teacher and now im a grandmother
4937964 i have lots of experience and research to send along to parents grandparents relatives and friends
4937965 i want to get more items on my website and im going to keep developing my blog im going to be adding childrens cds and more educational baby gift items i also want to add more clothes particularly organic clothes

4937968 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4937969 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4937970 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4937971 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4937972 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4937973 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4937974 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4937975 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4937976 thats why hes the he never lost his soul in chicago
4937977 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4937978 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4937979 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4937980 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4937981 we continue to bring in the most up to date materials from suppliers like carson dellosa scholastic and trend our goal is to make sure our customers can find exactly what they are looking for when they need it

4937983 we also plan to place more emphasis on fund raiser weeks our ultimate goal is to provide an unparalleled shopping experience for our parents and teachers
4937984 im very excited to begin working more closely with acs they are a well respected member of the billiards industry and we are pleased to be able to offer special savings to their players
4937985 amateur pool players playing competitively in leagues with their friends are a major driving force in pool today and our association with american cuesports will help us to better serve this large segment of the market
4937986 we strive to offer the lowest prices possible on the equipment pool players need typically our prices are about 20 below regular retail prices though the additional discount will deeply cut into our margins we feel that the increased exposure to the tens of thousands of acs members will ultimately be worthwhile
4937987 its much more efficient to satisfy user inquires in real time rather than through an extended stream of e mail exchanges
4937988 more and more of these kinds of cases are being brought to trial nationwide reflecting an increasing understanding in our criminal justice system that cruelty toward cats is not tolerated in a civil society
4937989 we applaud the henrico county commonwealths attorney office and encourage prosecutors across the country to uphold the laws which exist in all 50 states and the district of columbia that make intentionally killing a cat a criminal offense
4937990 richmond citizens should feel proud to live in such a caring city
4937991 local animal organizations have been providing free spay and neuter for feral cats and have humane programs in place like trap neuter return that meet the needs of the cats and the community
4937992 but there is still a need nationwide for education and awareness on feral cats and the cruelty and ineffectiveness of catch and kill so called animal control policies and sheltering practices need to change
4937993 catch and kill for outdoor cats does not reflect the values held by most americans

4938009 the credit crunch represents a unique challenge for organisations that need to reduce costs while at the same time increase their work force in order to grow as a business the graduate pool represents a solution
4938010 firstly candidates with experience are higher up on the career ladder so obviously have greater expectations in terms of starting salary secondly the really talented experienced candidates are usually retained by their employers who know better than to let a talented employee slip by them
4938011 while graduates expect a competitive salary and benefits what they tell us is a more important factor when considering a potential employer is that they work for a progressive company that offers long term career prospects
4938012 the challenge is to ensure new recruits are properly trained and developed obvious for graduates but also true for those with experience also
4938013 weve proven that with proper training and coaching even the most inexperienced graduate can meet and exceed the targets of even the most seasoned professional
4938014 weve always been willing to prove that our graduate recruitment and sales training process works which is why we offer to replace a candidate that is not achieving free of charge within the first twelve months of placement our 94 success rate illustrates we rarely have to do this but this is only half the story for companies who need extra reassurance weve developed a train amp invest scheme which allows employers to take on a new recruit for an eight week period while receiving full coaching support and sales training at no additional cost should they not work out this may seem crazy but illustrates the confidence that meta morphose has in the graduate talent pool for the future of uk industry
4938015 success in sales is directly proportionate to your control of one factor and it is your good fortune you can do something about it

4938032 employers are not prepared for an influx of older workers with flexible work schedules so many boomers will need to pursue opportunities for self employment that can produce reliable income without a lot of investment or risk
4938033 boomers should gain a sense of relief when they tap resources like the bbrc that are aggressively helping them define new income opportunities
4938034 the research clearly highlights the importance of online interaction between consumers when faced with purchasing decisions whether it is with blogs comparison sites or user reviews brands need to understand and engage with social media to survive the expected economic downturn
4938035 it is clear from this research that online strategies will have to become far more sophisticated to weather the economic slowdown a one size fits all strategy will no longer be the most effective and online retailers will have to start to segment their audience and match their marketing activity to each group

4938060 some of the wells might be too shallow or might have small amounts of oil not commercially viable

4938067 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4938068 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4938069 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4938070 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4938116 dont have to have a specific technique taught to them to figure out if theres a change
4938117 what we see in reality is that women who come in with something werent doing a specific breast exam
4938118 they were showering and felt something dressing and felt something its just a part of the activities of daily living
4938119 the industry is screaming this means we have to do more studies
4938120 one of the goals of treating diabetes is that you have to deal with the complications

4938135 but instead of trying to recruit a manufacturing plant here what im doing is recruiting production companies who might hire a pool of 200 people people that live here that rely on freelance opportunities working in feature films and in commercials for their livelihoods and those production companies are spending money here on leatherheads they spent about 7 million here in the piedmont triad alone they didnt even film the whole movie here they only filmed here a couple of weeks
4938136 what rebecca and her team are doing and in all fairness what people across the state are doing is exactly where we should be headed to transition from what has been traditionally a manufacturing economy
4938137 you have crews here theyre spending money theyre staying in hotels theyre eating
4938138 the film wins an academy award and he schneider thanks us in his acceptance speech and he thanks the school of the arts which gave him interns so right away bam weve got worldwide recognition and acknowledgement
4938139 the girls in the office heard a story that george clooney was in salisbury did you meet him
4938140 rebecca those girls at the office want to know if you met george clooney and i told them that i had some people there from a movie and they were looking around but they had one guy who was really handsome
4938141 keeping all the balls in the air without breaking your stride
4938142 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
4938143 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
4938144 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
4938145 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
4938146 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
4938147 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
4938148 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
4938149 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
4938150 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
4938151 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
4938152 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4938153 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4938154 i cannot image america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4938155 research shows that the abortion decisions of many women are influenced primarily by their desire to be good parents
4938156 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
4938157 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
4938158 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
4938159 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
4938160 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
4938161 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
4938162 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man

4938169 we put in the charges as soon as the matter was reported to us
4938170 covertly and visibly in kerala something which security analysts have been saying for years
4938171 nagori motivated those present at the camp besides physical training the youths were also given training in firearms and escaping from a spot after committing a crime
4938172 the camp was also attended by activists from outside the state it was held after the simi camp in ernakulam in kerala in which 30 to 35 youths had participated persons from vadodara ahmedabad and surat had also attended the ernakulam camp
4938173 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4938174 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4938175 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4938176 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4938177 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4938178 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4938179 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4938180 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4938181 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4938182 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4938183 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4938184 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4938185 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4938186 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4938187 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4938188 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4938189 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4938190 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4938191 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4938192 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4938193 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4938194 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4938195 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4938196 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4938197 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4938198 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4938199 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4938200 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4938201 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4938202 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4938203 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4938204 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4938205 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4938206 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4938207 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4938208 who are open to doing something on the production side
4938209 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4938210 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4938211 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4938212 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4938213 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4938214 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4938215 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4938216 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4938217 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4938218 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4938219 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4938220 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4938221 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4938222 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4938223 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4938224 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4938225 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4938226 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4938227 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4938228 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4938229 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4938230 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4938231 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4938232 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4938233 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4938234 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4938235 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4938236 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4938237 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4938238 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4938239 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4938240 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4938241 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4938242 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4938243 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4938244 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4938245 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4938246 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4938247 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4938248 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4938249 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4938250 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4938251 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4938252 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4938253 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4938254 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4938255 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4938256 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4938257 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4938258 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4938259 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4938260 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4938261 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4938262 i look upon the judgement of right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon and the rise and fall of beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons
4938263 come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest
4938264 each day is a journey and the journey itself home
4938265 i do not understand why others advance whose skills i exceed
4938266 no student of my age can best me in combat the texts of buddha and tamo i can recite as well as a master
4938267 why then am i passed for advancement over others lacking my skills
4938268 it is true my disciple that you are highly skilled in our physical and mental lessons but your mind is too much like the paper of a scroll you have recorded all we could teach you yet that same teaching has closed you into a meditation cell
4938269 do you hear that sound coming from beyond the swamp
4938270 it is said that the wood nymphs play the reeds as a maiden plays an instrument
4938271 perhaps i do not know but how is this important
4938272 the buddha told us to always see with open eyes and allow our vision to pierce the veils of illusion
4938273 a master must see with clarity so far you have learned that which we know but you have not learned how to see things new you have not imagined things unimaginable when you can do these things will you be ready to become a master
4938274 go from here and beyond the swamp find a wood nymph and bring it back here to play the midnight music at our temple
4938275 good morning disciple mei did you find a wood nymph for our temple last night
4938276 instead i found a small frog who lived among the reeds
4938277 i see and is this frog a large frog so he could make such a loud noise that we could hear so far from the swamp
4938278 no master in fact it was a tiny frog i found smaller than the frogs i usually see when i walk along a lakeside or pond it was barely the size of the tip of my thumb
4938279 then surely it had large strong arms with which to pluck music from the reeds on which it lived
4938280 indeed it had only thin and frail limbs it made music not by plucking but by blowing through a big globe it made from its own throat
4938281 no master though it was nearly half as big as the frog itself
4938282 so instead of a delicate wood nymph strumming music from the reeds you found the evening sound to come from a tiny frog blowing air from its own body
4938283 this is a lesson in finding the nature of truth that you must remember
4938284 it is easy to create an answer or accept an answer that has become widely accepted by others it takes a much more skilled mind and vision to see through illusion to walk the path of a buddha
4938285 why is knowing that frogs sing important to a shaolin of what use is such knowledge
4938286 everything in my closet is colorized shoes clothes hats etc
4938287 we know there is a vast morass of information out there that our audiences want us to try to make sense of the danger consists in trying to leap above it not by getting more dramatic or salient or verifiable facts but by analyzing speculating predicting interpreting by drawing definitive conclusions while the bodies are still warm
4938288 theres a lot of things scott can do that are going to help our club defensively hes one of the best hes a good hitter he hits right handers really well i think the power will come back i think playing in this ballpark helps a little bit
4938289 music the grouchy dubliner who never lost his sense of humour
4938290 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
4938291 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
4938292 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4938293 posso nunca chegar a ser o melhor engenheiro do mundo mas tenha certeza de
4938294 you canfool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some ofthe time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time

4938300 i paid the bills the minute the envelope hit the desk
4938301 all of a sudden in july they swapped it to 18 percent no warning no reason it was like i was blindsided
4938302 were not going to let you have this credit card loan anymore and were going to say pay it off or we can say youre now more risky were going to raise your rate
4938303 i certainly didnt imagine that someday we mightve ended up creating a frankenstein
4938304 i look at that and i say to myself is 50 a fair fee plus a 25 percent interest rate and all these other fees that are thrown on for folks who are probably not that risky
4938305 i think it is generally understood that those that use the revolving part of the credit card are kind of the sweet spot
4938306 we reserve the right to change the terms at any time for any reason
4938307 what are they going to do if we have a spike in interest rates
4938308 what are they going to start charging people 35 percent 38 percent if it comes to that you might as well go to the loan sharks
4938309 they do better when they apply these price increases selectively to customers who statistically have become more risky or to those who have violated the rules of the account
4938310 the consumer really has no rights to find out anything to demand why is this being done to me
4938311 it has gotten to the point where the fine print is becoming almost outright abusive of their customers
4938312 the customers who are affected most by this practice are those who for one reason or another are having trouble making payments and have a large balance
4938313 if we see indications that a customer is taking on too much debt has missed or is late on payments to other creditors or is otherwise mishandling their personal finances it is not unreasonable to determine that this behavior is an increased risk in the interest of all of our customers we must protect the portfolio by adjusting a customers rate to compensate for that increased risk
4938314 lenders use that score almost like a thermometer to determine if theyre going to grant credit or not
4938315 i used that card whenever i possibly could because of the travel benefits
4938316 i wasnt late and i didnt go over the credit limit and i didnt write bad checks
4938317 it was like they almost all had a little meeting in the back room and said lets get strachan
4938318 how does it serve them to treat people like that are they trying to force them into bankruptcy
4938319 thousands of complaints every year about credit card issues relating to the major banks the major card issuers
4938320 we dont need to deal with you because the o
4938321 those are unfair practices they are unsafe and unsound and dont do them
4938322 instead they said its a problem look if they think its a problem then tell the credit card companies to stop doing it
4938323 as long as were at the table were going to keep pursuing that

4938388 mr luke isnt going to take us anywhere again unless you come
4938389 my mother would be appalled at the idea of anyone not coming to dinner when called
4938390 our mommy died so she isnt palled about anything anymore
4938391 my mother just died a couple of weeks ago and i want to please her now more than ever it breaks my heart to think of her in heaven and disappointed because i behave badly
4938392 something was wrong in her head and it killed her

4938416 did anyone get banned for 53 house i did on club penguin
4938417 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
4938418 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
4938419 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4938420 my feelings for ellen overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian she told the
4938421 that had never happened to me in my life where i saw somebody and experienced all of those things you hear about in songs and read about in poetry my knees were weak
4938422 i never would have thought my life would have turned out this way
4938423 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4938424 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4938425 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4938426 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4938427 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4938428 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

4938445 that is new hardware or software that makes it possible to automate a system or process
4938446 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4938447 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4938448 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4938449 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4938450 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4938451 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4938452 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4938453 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4938454 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4938455 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4938456 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4938457 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4938458 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4938459 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4938460 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4938461 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4938462 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4938463 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4938464 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4938465 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4938466 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4938467 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4938468 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4938469 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4938470 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4938471 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4938472 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4938473 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4938474 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4938475 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4938476 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4938477 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4938478 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4938479 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4938480 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4938481 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4938482 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4938483 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4938484 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4938485 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4938486 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4938487 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4938488 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4938489 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4938490 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4938491 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4938492 this is a planning took where all things are going
4938493 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4938494 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4938495 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4938496 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4938497 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4938498 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4938499 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4938500 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4938501 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4938502 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4938503 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4938504 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4938505 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4938506 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4938507 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4938508 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4938509 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4938510 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4938511 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4938512 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4938513 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4938514 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4938515 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4938516 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4938517 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4938518 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4938519 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4938520 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4938599 how anyone bounces back from a big setback or disappointment depends on their level of resilience
4938600 parents have the power to promote a great deal of resilience in their kids and parents have the power to stand in the way of their children developing resilience
4938601 some of us are more nervous by virtue of birth some of us are sturdier and hardier but above and beyond a quality at birth resilience is learned and developed through practice
4938602 resilience is developed through the practice of facing and coping with adversity

4938606 its planting the seeds of someone who uses things to feel good
4938607 acknowledge the feelings say i see how upset you are tell me about it and then leave it be
4938608 allow the daughter to sit with the sadness and the disappointment whether it takes 15 minutes or two hours and discover that the feelings will go away and she will in fact survive those feelings just fine maybe shell take out a book or write in her diary or call a friend which are all healthy mechanisms she can learn to rely on

4938871 shes truly remarkable she gives me hope for another 20 years
4938872 its funny to put things in perspective she actually was talking about childbirth in the ready room
4938873 she thought swimming is tough but she said childbirth is harder
4938874 shes done a fantastic job proving that yes women can have children and still compete at a high level
4938875 shes kind of gotten rid of a lot of the mythology in swimming that has been there so long
4938876 im sorry im going to start crying now its been awesome
4938877 it seems every team ive been on has been more fun and better and better
4938878 it really doesnt mean anything to me i was just glad to come in and win three medals

4938893 i didnt have time to think said keller the best offensive tight end in the draft this year
4938894 you dont have time to think when the balls coming at you 100 miles an hour
4938895 just a different jersey he drove the ball against our first team defense
4938896 it worked out better than i thought it would he said
4938897 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around okay ten days ago i was doing yardwork
4938898 strategically its important for the campaigns to be able to say someone is strong or weak it can undercut or increase their ability to raise money
4938899 but its like reading tea leaves maybe there is more at stake this year i think the big thing on both sides is whether rossi will get more money if he beats expectations

4938931 surely next months decrease will be the biggest drop in a long time
4938932 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
4938933 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
4938934 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
4938935 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
4938936 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
4938937 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
4938938 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
4938939 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
4938940 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
4938941 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
4938942 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
4938943 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
4938944 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
4938945 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
4938946 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
4938947 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york

4938949 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
4938950 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
4938951 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
4938952 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare

4938966 you always try to improve jay is going to be hard on himself theres not a lot of perfect games out there so if you think youre perfect youre going to be embarrassed pretty quickly
4938967 it all started with those guys they got the tempo going for us and that kept them off balance
4938968 they gave me some time to throw the ball youve got to give those guys some credit
4938969 we had a scouting report on the cowboys because we practiced against them for two days
4938970 so we knew they were sitting on our routes a little bit it was something we had in our game plan and we came out and executed it
4938971 absolutely you cant forget about the other guy over there eddie royal
4938972 that kid is amazing honestly when they first drafted him i was like who is this guy and why did we get him now that i see hes such a playmaker im glad that ive got him on the other side
4938973 it comes from a lot of preparation and having guys around me helping me out brandon marshall darrell jackson he list goes on and on including coach
4938974 hes got exceptional ability and great speed and great quickness
4938975 you guys saw him the first day he wanted the starting role and he embraced the challenge he has been very consistent in practice and done pretty well in the game
4938976 i tried to rally the defense up tell everybody to get playing
4938977 ended up getting a turnover cant get no better than that
4938978 im gone and then then it just happened when you hit the ground it definitely hurts your feelings
4938979 they all congratulated me with high fives and helmet hits and then after that went away then everybody just started getting on me about how i got tackled by the quarterback
4938980 that kind of hurt my feelings im still hearing it im going to continue to hear it forever now but i mean its all in good fun
4938981 im going to fall asleep but then im going to have a nightmare about the same quarterback over and over catching me
4938982 my neck doesnt even hurt i dont have a headache
4938983 sometimes those plays happen you have to be alert for it
4938984 there was a mix up with my familys flights and they couldnt arrive until after the game

4938986 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4938987 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4938988 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4938989 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

4938996 i really think we have three quarterbacks who can play and it wouldnt surprise me if all three play this season but what we have to do is find one who we can win with
4938997 jordan threw an interception at the end and portis had opportunities he did ok but has to make more plays
4938998 but it was really the blocking by my teammates that allowed me to make the plays
4938999 our defense has dominated our offense for a lot of camp
4939000 it was a little surprising to see that happen but maybe its a good thing when davin came to our camp i fell in love with him ive learned my lesson when i see a fast athlete who is also a good student i take them because god only made so many of them
4939001 the depth chart hasnt changed since the beginning of camp
4939002 it was made very clear to me that it was open competition
4939003 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us

4939028 hes got a lot to learn hes a kid getting into a grown mans game
4939029 they compared him and he accepted that but hes his own player
4939030 i guess its hard to hide from those comparisons when youre 6 foot 9
4939031 knowing him and his situation his background and the things hes been through im just happy to see him reach a lifetime goal

4939043 i wanted to open a gallery and my friend wanted to open a bar i said no he said we can do both
4939044 lele called and the first thing out of her mouth was why dont you open a gallery and bar with me
4939045 still i couldnt see how an emerging artist gallery would work without some kind of daily income about 4 years ago i thought what about liquor a full service gallery with dedicated space and a full service bar
4939046 galleries are always quiet spaces but i felt there were younger potential collectors who were i wouldnt say intimidated but galleries werent an obvious connection for them art in this country hasnt always been that integrated into the culture
4939047 since we opened weve had a number of people who have bought their first piece of art here thats really satisfying thats when i feel like the vision succeeded
4939048 i wanted there to be a lot of life around the artwork
4939049 we have thousands of people come through here in a month
4939050 good bouncers who watch out for the art most of our employees are artists or have worked with art weve had such good clientele from the beginning we didnt build this for the money but to do something really special and i think people sense that

4939082 the investigation and presentation of some mitigating evidence is not sufficient to meet the constitutional standard under strickland v washington 466 u s 668 1984 if counsel fails to investigate reasonably available sources or neglects to present mitigating evidence without a strong strategic reason
4939083 entirety of the experts description of mr wilsons psychological state is no more than a page of the sentencing transcript
4939084 occurred on cross examination was a train wreck for mr wilson
4939085 the mere fact that more evidence could have been presented is not
4939086 the defendant has introduced specific evidence indicating that counsel hired the expert so late in the process that he was unable to complete necessary mental health evaluations that counsel failed to gather or provide readily available relevant information that would have affected the diagnosis and that counsel failed to present the experts actual diagnoses to the jury
4939087 when a state courts disposition of a mixed question of law and fact is based on an incomplete factual record through no fault of the defendant and the complete factual record has since been developed and is before this court we apply de novo review to our evaluation of the underlying claim
4939088 he will implicate the defendant eric king without a doubt
4939089 strategically its important for the campaigns to be able to say someone is strong or weak it can undercut or increase their ability to raise money
4939090 but its like reading tea leaves maybe there is more at stake this year i think the big thing on both sides is whether rossi will get more money if he beats expectations

4939108 the name joan hodgman is recognized by every neonatologist throughout the world
4939109 she built up with her students and colleagues a group of symptoms and signs that alerted us to what we could do in terms of keeping these little babies alive
4939110 my image of her is doing this detailed examination and making me repeat the examination until i got it right and im not a neonatologist
4939111 she definitely left a mark on my career and countless other pediatric residents over the 60 years she was at county hospital
4939112 seeing all those people pounding on that poor baby gave me a violent physiological reaction
4939113 the doctors looked at her and then at the baby before walking away
4939114 she was very much interested in making that a debatable question
4939115 that in itself was not too easy because we had a hospital where a lot of people would under no circumstances give up the fight but she was willing to question it and do the research to support the need to face these questions
4939116 i feel that we should try not to give care that is futile
4939117 i dont see futile care in terms of dollars and cents which in one sense it is but as an issue of compassion that is centered on appropriate care
4939118 what we used to call before the multicultural age facts
4939119 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
4939120 that is a source of strength and sustenance i know that i dont walk alone
4939121 i dont think there is a hard and fast line at which you say we are going in it is always a judgment call

4939126 really had a vision for making the museum accessible and welcoming for families
4939127 a large part of the credit for that was due to georges vision
4939128 at the time he got into it santa fe springs was an old oil field and land was being sold at the intersection of the 605 and 5 freeways
4939129 initial direction was to focus on big gifts make a big difference with a few important organizations and become personally involved in the process
4939130 if i get interested in something i want to be involved
4939131 he thought that maybe his orthodontic training was a reason he was so interested in sculpture

4939134 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4939136 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4939137 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4939138 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4939139 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4939140 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4939141 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4939142 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
4939143 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4939144 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
4939145 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
4939146 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
4939147 why its difficult to tell because we dont know the strengths of our opponents we know how well prepared the runners from kenya and ethiopia are but we dont know what form they are in as they go to the starting line this applies equally to all our main opponents
4939148 of course if you are going to the olympics you are going there in order to win im one of those my mind is set on winning and any other result for me is a loss therefore ill do everything for my country to make this come true

4939165 he doesnt have to go its his decision and a player can refuse to go on loan all i have said to nicky and he agrees is he needs to play because unfortunately hes missed a lot of pre season training and matches
4939166 hes not going to get the opportunity to play here against luton yesterday from the start so if we can get him out it will be best for both parties but it is up to nicky southall to decide what he wants to do go and play or sit and watch

4939216 the murder lends credence to all the allegations we have heard of continued human rights violations in the philippines
4939217 for us in san francisco who have an active and growing sister city relationship with manila it causes a particular and grave concern for the future of that relationship
4939218 it is worth mentioning that no less than mr aquino himself realized that president and mrs marcos saved his life in 1980 when despite a court conviction and a pending review of his cases in the supreme court they allowed him to leave for america with a special team of doctors to save his life due to a heart ailment
4939219 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
4939220 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
4939221 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
4939222 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
4939223 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
4939224 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
4939225 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
4939226 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4939227 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
4939228 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
4939229 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning

4939238 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4939239 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4939240 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4939241 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4939259 roy is like my muse since i was a kid i used to hang with roy my blues influence comes from roy i call him for everything ill drive to oakland pick up roy in the morning get something to eat drop him off and come back at him for dinner i play stuff for him first i played the joss stuff for him first i play my stuff for him first
4939260 i can never get used to him being my friend because its stevie wonder
4939261 i called him and he was like whats up fool i said i need you to play this harmonica solo he popped up in like an hour
4939262 they painted over us they made the paint match line for line
4939263 boy the lyrics and the words are both good on that song
4939264 first day on set without much interaction she had all the mannerisms pretty much down
4939265 hes taught me what it means to be a songwriter and producer
4939266 the live performance scenes helped me ease into the role made me feel comfortable
4939267 while we were shooting it was me the music director and rainns drum coach
4939268 hey your sic pretty great lets sic elope how do you spell elope i dont know but we should
4939269 i just wanted to say that i saw an advanced screening of the rocker and it was absolutely amazing
4939270 people are going to love that so much you did an amazing job
4939271 we had our first show last night and i turned to the guys i play with and said lets just have fun once you realize how much fun your fans are having it becomes easy to have fun with them
4939272 hes just a really funny guy and i like his style of humor
4939273 and what people may not know is that hes a really really nice dude too good aura
4939274 a lot of whats happened with my career has been because of the internet
4939275 its a way for me to reach fans directly especially with music
4939276 i take the good stuff with a pinch of salt and the bad stuff with a pinch of salt
4939277 kind of liberating to act the part of someone who has no acting talent
4939278 someone who could be so emotionally effusive and open is not something you would find in a lot of british people
4939279 really flawed and vulgar and stupid and all kinds of things at once i saw it as an opportunity to do something big
4939280 in some ways there is a lot riding on the films success
4939281 it could open up new opportunities for me all that kind of variety is what keeps you feeling vital
4939282 but i am fortunate to have a career that is healthy enough in england that anything that happens here is a bonus
4939283 my life wont fall apart if it doesnt change i am already working with people i like so it is all upside for me
4939284 he was right there with the drugs i tried to warn owen i hope from the bottom of my heart that owen stays the hell away from that guy
4939285 totally malicious and utterly without any foundation whatsoever it was totally invented it annoyed me because it was very difficult for me to defend myself because of course my concern was with owen it wasnt with being preoccupied with something that was slanderous i didnt want to inflame the situation by getting into a tit for tat
4939286 he was as appalled as i was when he read that
4939287 there was a lot of noise in the house a lot of hustle and bustle
4939288 to get any kind of attention you really had to do something
4939289 some very verbose relative or someone maybe the rest of the family wasnt too keen on in school my teacher would have me stand in front of class and mimic other teachers for his own amusement when i was reluctant he would say well then we can open the books and do some work then the rest of the students wanted me to do it because they didnt want to work
4939290 then we did hamlet 1 as i like to refer to it now
4939291 it was a major disappointment for them that they wound up teaching
4939292 the frustration was that the talented people perhaps arent as passionate about theater as the less talented it is the lack of justice in the creative world because talent is something you can perfect you can make better but you cant just bestow it on someone it is sort of a god given thing and he is pretty unjust about who he hands it out to
4939293 actors say they do their own stunts for the integrity of the film but i do them because they look like a lot of fun
4939294 parents and guardians can prepare for this possible increase in asthma episodes by scheduling a well asthma visit with the childs asthma provider
4939295 at this visit health care providers should review or develop an asthma action plan for the child
4939296 we fought back for me its not always going to look pretty but ill get the job done
4939297 in an attempt to define senecas position a bit more we wanted to see how charlie handled a game
4939298 he was in a lot of different situations tonight so it will be a good film study thing for him
4939299 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4939300 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4939301 i mean if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the new york times you got a pretty sorry existence
4939302 the same goes for the dayton daily worker and forbes com
4939303 daytons economy may no longer provide the flash and glitter of 20th century economic leadership but the region has demonstrated a remarkable robustness that holds lessons for other cities striving to remain competitive in a global economy
4939304 dayton survived by building on the secrets of its past success
4939305 when we show the film so many people ask does she still do the gymnastics or the dance
4939306 yes she does and pilates and yoga she really puts everybody to shame but i think thats a good thing
4939307 generally mimi hasnt broken through as a star in the conventional sense
4939308 but i think this is a bit different from the conventional story arc
4939309 oh it was an adventure to go shopping with nana she was simply magnificent she always wore a tall great hat with feathers
4939310 style is like learning a language you pick up those things and they never leave you
4939311 i was getting older and looking for role models people i could admire
4939312 she lives her own life so many of us are so worried about what other people are thinking she says that thats not important she pushes on the edges of life and yet it works for her
4939313 when i first saw a flower i just saw a flower now i see so much more
4939314 i dont think i would have graduated without this class senior year
4939315 ive learned what city kids can do if given a chance to grow in the garden
4939316 i dont see us at this moment picking up that program
4939317 i will if he talks to me try to help him get some philanthropy dollars or other dollars to continue the program
4939318 the thing about a comic book is that its the purest visual medium
4939319 the story can go right from the brain to the pen and onto the paper you cant do that with movies because theyre such a collaborative medium in comics youre seeing ideas that are much purer and more creative
4939320 i dont see comics as a genre but as a medium
4939321 sometimes within the studio system people feel beat down they know the hurdles to get over to get an idea through so they limit themselves whereas with comics we didnt have to appeal to 100 million people we could do something that appeals to a much smaller audience
4939322 right now were seeing the superhero genre come to a head because for one thing a lot of studio executives and writers and directors grew up in the 80s when comics were coming of age as a mature medium also technology is finally at a point where the films can be done realistically and not tongue in cheek
4939323 its a nice way to wrap up the summer moviegoing experience where you walk out of the theater and its not just the explosions youre talking about
4939324 docuweek is like a respite youve had your popcorn experience and now youre ready for a full meal
4939325 its exciting to present films that really define the world were living in
4939326 whether its our own backyard a distant time and place or a state of mind
4939327 we have seen a few distribution companies fold but its a tough time in the economy period
4939328 i dont think the documentary is experiencing any kind of downturn whatsoever in fact i think documentary has infiltrated entertainment more than ever before
4939329 were working with such a wide canvas now that you can really do almost anything in documentary work animation re creation the 3 d after effects that people do with stills giving cameras to your subjects which ive done a number of times
4939330 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4939331 we have got to go away and grow away from the callow and puerile philosophy that this situation will go away its frightfully difficult but will be richly rewarding if we work together we can find workable sensible and achievable ways to get through this period
4939332 the paris biennale is probably about 2 500 to 2 700 per square meter
4939333 grosvernor house in london is probably about 1 300 per square meter palm beach at the time was asking about 900 per square meter maastricht then was asking about 425 per square meter my argument to the palm beach people was why would i spend 900 to exhibit in florida when i can show at maastricht for 425 with 78 000 visitors qualified visitors youve got be qualified to find maastricht
4939334 what i find so satisfying about tefaf is the level of questions you get there
4939335 i could sit here for a year and not get as many informed questions about the work on hand as i get in an hour at the fair eighty percent of our business is done outside california anyway
4939336 were always thinking can we get it conserved in time can we get all the paperwork in place there are a lot of paintings well bring for the first time
4939337 i had discovered this wonderful dutch mannerist painting it was thought to be a fake rubens but turned out to be a genuine hendrick goltzius it went from being a fake rubens at 25 000 to being a right goltzius at 1 5 million we once had an anton raphael mengs a view of the great castle at bayreuth which is not something we would normally handle but put out there in that marketplace it sold immediately to the german government to go back to bayreuth
4939338 then shipping we have these show containers that we send over waterproof lined and sealed and all that it will probably cost about 8 000 round trip for shipping and insurance we have built into our insurance policy that we do three or four fairs a year and i think its for between 7 million and 10 million worth of art which is not much when you look at the price of art these days
4939339 we had that coveted corner position once or twice and we would have as many as 900 to 1 200 people an hour passing through the stand thats too many people you cant concentrate on those who are really interested when you need to answer their questions
4939340 while there we met local historian roy turner who introduced us to the fascinating and little known details of presleys early years turner opened up a world that we didnt know existed
4939341 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4939342 i herniated a disc in my back three years ago and havent been the same since
4939343 as if that werent bad enough i also suffer from sleep apnea
4939344 he asked me what kind of pillow i was sleeping on i told him i wasnt sure what brand it was but it was soft and comfortable he told me to throw it away and start sleeping on a tri core cervical orthopedic pillow instead i did and have had tremendous results
4939345 the design also helps relieve spasms and alleviates minor tension since it re establishes the natural cervical curve of the neck while the person is at rest
4939346 even better than that it seems to have cured my sleep apnea as well
4939347 i cant tell you how good it feels to get a good nights sleep ive never felt better in my life
4939348 you spend about a third of your life in bed so i tell my patients to make sure their slumber is comfortable
4939349 the little guy can play ive said that from the very beginning
4939350 karena kondisi kesehatan beliau yang sakit maka tidak mungkin diadili apalagi itu sudah diputuskan melalui skp3 kalau kita mau menegakkan hukum ya begitu karena menurut hukum orang sakit tidak bisa diadili
4939351 kalau orang berpura pura sakit untuk menghindari proses hukum beliau benar benar sakit semua orang tahu kalau beliau sakit bahkan sampai menjalani operasi
4939352 hukum kita menyatakan orang sakit tidak bisa diadili ya kita ikuti kalau presiden korea park chung hee kan tidak sakit makanya dia bisa diadili
4939353 upaya pengendalian banjir harus dilakukan secara menyeluruh dari hulu hingga hilir dengan melibatkan pemerintah pusat dan pemerintah daerah di sekitar jakarta
4939354 pemerintah pusat juga diminta konsisten untuk melaksanakan konservasi sumber daya air di hulu agar air yang mengalir akibat curah hujan yang tinggi dapat diminimalisir
4939355 pemerintah dki sendiri dalam lima tahun yang akan datang akan melaksanakan pembangunan peningkatan normalisasi pemeliharaan serta pengoperasian sarana dan prasarana pengendali banjir dan drainase
4939356 pelajar yang akan meneruskan perguruan tinggi tentu tidak bisa memilih mengutamakan salah satu
4939357 ke depan jatim mengusulkan agar umptn dan un bisa digabung april nanti kami akan presentasikan ide itu ke menteri pendidikan nasional jika menteri setuju akan mudah mewujudkannya
4939358 menkominfo muhammad nuh akan meluncurkan indikator makro tik pada acara seminar indonesia outlook 2008 pada kamis 31 januari 2008 mendatang
4939359 harusnya kita tidak terlalu jelek jelek amat tetapi kenapa indonesia ada di ranking bawah kita curiga mereka yang di ranking tidak mempunyai informasi yang lengkap dan akurat sehingga menempatkan indonesia pada rangking bawah
4939360 itu keterlaluan pasti data kurang akurat sehingga indonesia berada pada peringkat itu
4939361 investor akan mau melaksanakan investasi kalau tik di suatu negara sudah baik itu menjadi tujuan investasi karena tik berkaitan dengan banyak faktor salah satunya adalah produktivitas bila tik suatu negara tinggi maka produktivitas tinggi dan investasi juga akan tinggi
4939362 he needs to buff up his personality and really demonstrate his charisma
4939363 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4939364 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4939365 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4939366 but we dont talk about people who practice or do not practice siddha yoga we dont seek publicity
4939367 on a personal level i do think its awesome that she has created interest in mediation and yoga
4939368 one womans search for everything across italy india and indonesia
4939369 occupy a similar space in the popular consciousness and life of americans
4939370 my heart skipped a beat and then flat out tripped over itself and fell on its face
4939371 and when i heard she had an ashram in india
4939372 i knew i must take myself there as quickly as possible
4939373 i will not be using my gurus name throughout this book because i cannot speak for her her teachings speak best for themselves nor will i reveal the name or location of her ashram
4939374 publicity which it may have neither the interest nor the resources
4939375 its just a promise i made to myself four years ago to say nothing more about any of it than whats in the book
4939376 until we discover another new author or another way of meditating eating loving or dying
4939377 gilbert does tap into the essential core of human conflict seeking and being and her trip to india and some of her experiences there is evidence of the human yearning to deal with the human dilemma
4939378 it happened before he was even charged that doesnt speak of an innocent man
4939379 your bail will remain revoked until such time that i see youre taking steps to address your psychological issues
4939380 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4939381 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4939382 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4939383 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4939384 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4939385 preparing for the psychological stress of long duration space missions
4939386 preparing for the psychological stress of long duration space missions
4939387 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
4939388 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
4939389 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
4939390 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realise their wishes and dreams
4939391 las filas se est n desplazando desde tsjinvali a rusia
4939392 ustedes deben entender que hay una gran cantidad de soldados
4939393 well now he has a chance of 5 medals 7 if you include the hurdles 8 if you include the long jump and 9 if he can do the triple jump

4939396 les troupes russes ont commenc leur retrait et des forces de maintien de la paix russe sont en train darriver
4939397 liquor is allowed by their religion so we allow them
4939398 we have to understand the political reality that we are part of an alliance and we do not have absolute power so under such a government we focus on universal islamic values like fighting corruption
4939399 for starters states under the opposition alliance can reduce the number of gambling premises as gambling is strictly prohibited by all religions
4939400 permits or licences to sell alcohol should either be limited or only allowed for areas inhabited by non muslims
4939401 may this bread and wine become for us the body and blood christ that we may be for the world the body of christ redeemed by his blood
4939402 well just be happy it wasnt as bad as it was for me
4939403 how was work did you have a hard day today
4939404 i say dont look at your debt more than one hour a week that hour is when you pay bills and its when you cry moan and feel bad if you need to the rest of the time you need to be proactive thinking about positive ways to save money be happy about the fact that youre doing everything you can and go to sleep at night
4939405 what we know is that isolation kills which means it drives up stress and community or being with other people in disclosure and telling the truth is a healing balm
4939406 it is physiologically impossible to be stressed and be grateful at the same time so when you see that bill and think that you just cant take one more thing take a deep breath and be thankful
4939407 the key factor right now especially with all the trouble in the economy is that you have to remain positive and optimistic keep an upbeat attitude
4939408 well be dealing with such issues in order to make people aware that poverty can drive you into this kind of situation
4939409 we are saying that our pain in south africa should be the pain of all lutherans our joy in celebrating 2010 should be the joy of all lutherans and therefore our concerns our ethical concerns should be the concerns of all the lutherans in the world we need both human and material support
4939410 lenovo continues to push the technology envelope by giving road warriors the latest enhancements in solid say drive storage and digital display technologies with the new thinkpad x301 notebook pc

4939412 hes a british citizen vietnam wants him to go back to the uk
4939413 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4939414 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
4939415 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
4939416 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4939417 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4939418 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4939419 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4939420 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4939421 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4939422 i think its going to be a great opportunity to buy chinese shares because the long term growth will be there china is going to grow probably three times as fast as the global average
4939423 i dont think china should go back to the 11 to 12 percent rate thats overheated
4939424 this slowdown should help china to sustain growth for the longer term
4939425 when growth slows down the demand for energy and the demand for metal will come down that may bring down the inflation
4939426 a slowdown in the u s and especially a global slowdown will hit china
4939427 growth hasnt fallen off a cliff its holding up reasonably well but moderating thats true in corporate earnings as well as the macro economy
4939428 every major political transition in china has had inflation at either the backdrop or at the forefront
4939429 does an increase in the inflation rate cause government officials to clamp down on the kinds of reforms that have so benefited chinas economy
4939430 i do think investors should have some part of their portfolio dedicated to these emerging growth stories in asia
4939431 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4939432 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4939433 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4939434 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4939435 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4939436 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4939437 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4939438 on one of these medical missions mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states
4939439 on one of those medical missions to mother teresas orphanage cindy was convinced to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states
4939440 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4939441 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
4939442 there wasnt enough time on the last run to warm the tyres so we couldnt respond
4939443 its a shame but were not too far from the front and if we avoid trouble in the first few laps we could benefit from any incidents that may happen
4939444 its not been a bad day and its a good result at the end of it
4939445 i could possibly have gone quicker but i dont think it would have changed my position at the end of it
4939446 my first quick lap was very slightly compromised by traffic but my next lap put me up to third and the one after got me into second
4939447 i had to try and get pole and my final run was a real take your brain out one
4939448 i do like this circuit its perfect for touring car racing
4939449 however i am surprised we are on the front row if you looked at the circuits at the start of the year you would have chosen tracks where the diesel would be strong and tracks where it wouldnt be and this is one where we wouldnt have been too confident however the car has been good and its actually been better in certain areas than the petrol car although in other areas it isnt as good
4939450 our aim is to see pakistan as a stable strong and prosperous country for its citizens the region and the world as a whole britain fully supports the democratic process in pakistan and believes in supporting the democratic institutions not individuals
4939451 your brother was lost but now he is found your brother was as good as dead but now he is alive and well right here at home with us
4939452 you were always with me and all that i have is yours
4939453 la cosa pi eccitante in questa combinazione tra noi e la activision quella di mettere insieme due mondi diversi quello dellintrattenimento casalingo e quello dellonline dei giochi da casa e quelli attraverso internet che ci permette di avere footprint in tutte e due le categorie in mercati aperti in tutto il mondo e la logica conclusione di un percorso di business che abbiamo iniziato molti anni fa e che ci ha portato a grandi risultati negli anni passati
4939454 i will never forget the joy and the hatred in the voices of kuntar and his men as they swaggered about hunting for us firing their guns and throwing grenades
4939455 i knew that if yael cried out the terrorists would toss a grenade into the crawl space and we would be killed
4939456 so i kept my hand over her mouth hoping she could breathe as i lay there i remembered my mother telling me how she had hidden from the nazis during the holocaust this is just like what happened to my mother i thought
4939457 by the time we were rescued from the crawl space hours later yael too was dead in trying to save all our lives i had smothered her
4939458 a lot of us were kind of brought up that way
4939459 so we feel like we have to break that barrier were being baptized into a kingdom thats a lot bigger than a building
4939460 i cant do it by myself now im doing my baptism to turn my life my will over to god
4939461 according to statements given by the defendants the 130 pound steinhauer an honor student started the fight by groping softics girlfriend on the dance floor and then head butting softic and taking a swing at the 6 foot 9 260 pound kovacevic when they confronted him
4939462 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4939463 when i was in school they didnt have history we made it
4939464 the attack sparked a two hour firefight even after the arrival of the reinforcement troops the firefight was ongoing
4939465 we are counter checking but we have a lot of people there
4939466 they risked taking the shortcut unaware that the creek was swollen
4939467 ik had een moeilijke jeugd ik experimenteerde met drugs en drank
4939468 ik herleid dat tot een zeker ego sme van mijn kant
4939469 was bedoeld als satire maar als zodanig onvoldoende herkenbaar was en hoe dan ook iets waar rover niet mee geassocieerd wenst te worden
4939470 rover voorzitter michael van der vlis had hem eerder verzocht daar op nova waar hij ter toelichting was uitgenodigd volledig en ondubbelzinnig afstand van te nemen en zijn diepe excuses aan te bieden dat heeft hij onvoldoende gedaan en dus heeft de voorzitter hem per onmiddellijk van dat woordvoerderschap ontheven
4939471 eu gostaria de tentar algumas provas novas provas que n o tentei ainda que n o fiz aqui para depois ver o que acontece bob bowman seu treinador disse que quer testar coisas que n o fizemos antes testar novos m todos ser o quatro anos divertidos

4939474 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected

4939528 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4939529 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4939530 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4939531 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation

4939542 dovrei parlare di arte di politica di economia io sono uno che sta nel calcio se un giornalista viene da me lo fa perch vuole avere unopinione competente altrimenti fuori dal calcio io sono uno qualunque e il mio parere conta come quello di un contadino eppure dal contadino non va nessuno
4939543 modulo e sistemi di allenamento non li cambier mai qui a roma come in unaltra citt per coprire il campo non esiste un modulo migliore del 4 3 3
4939544 io alleno ma non posso scendere in campo e giocare
4939545 il calcio sempre lo stesso sia in una piccola che in una grande citt il campo ha sempre le stesse misure e la preparazione sempre la stessa
4939546 nella mia carriera mi sono procurato tanti nemici meglio cos loro rappresentano uno stimolo
4939547 pretendo che ogni giocatore dia il meglio di se stesso nel rispetto dellesigenza di fare spettacolo se non vinciamo nessun dramma mi basta che i ragazzi abbiano dato il massimo
4939548 da piccolo a praga mi dissero prendi qella posizione e mai prendi quelluomo da quel giorno non ho pi cambiato idea sarebbe stata la zona il mio modulo di gioco ideale

4939554 non ho rapporti con la stampa o la televisione voglio essere giudicato per quello che faccio con la mia squadra non mi interessano altre esibizioni
4939555 raramente mi capita di dire una bugia per questo mi sento solo e un mondo il nostro in cui se ne dicono tante
4939556 riguardo a chi mi chiede conto di alcuni errori commessi lo scorso anno posso dire semplicemente che chi fa fa sempre errori solo chi non fa nulla non sbaglia limportante fare errori in buona fede e ancor pi importante accorgersene e porvi rimedio

4939713 estamos convencidos de que esto lo vamos a sacar adelante como tambi n lo estamos con lo que nos transmite sanguinetti
4939714 tendremos enfrente a un rival duro con la necesidad de sumar de tratar de mejorar lo que se hizo bien en el partido pasado corregir y agregarle cosas
4939715 esperemos contrarrestar las virtudes del rival y ser nosotros los que tengamos la pelota con la misma t cnica de lo que venimos trabajando sabiendo que tenemos que estar ordenados de concretar las situaciones que se generan pero sin desesperarnos
4939716 pero va a ser mucho m s f cil cuando los resultados se den lo que s tenemos que ser es conscientes de que si nos salimos de esto y queremos hacer cada uno los suyo nos desordenamos y vamos a perder lo que hoy tenemos que es el orden y consolidado un sistema de juego a eso hay que mantenerlo mejorarlo y agregarle cosas como cierta frialdad a la hora del manejo tener en claro que debemos ir por los costados y no por el medio y que entre la pelota

4939726 i find it quite liberating to get away from home and do some work in a place where i feel relaxed and can focus this might sound strange but i cant focus at home because ive got 2 kids so almost every weekend i leave them with my husband and come here and then walk along the beach

4939732 i attended government primary school where the fee was 5 hong kong currency which is equivalent to 30 times more today i was born after the second world war and the country was poor after high school i decided to work and saved enough to pay for my own private study
4939733 i applied and was assigned to the lowest rank of assistant investigator basically the organisation was set up to investigate corruption offences committed by any person and the job was mostly detective work
4939734 however there are certain areas of crime being investigated apart from corruption offences like dangerous drugs smuggling and white collar crimes such as commercial fraud tax evasion illegal immigrants which are related to corruption offences
4939735 it is very challenging being an investigator especially when dealing with corruption back in the old days in hong kong corruption was widespread because at the time new comers did not know much about the law
4939736 common sense prevails corruption in general is difficult to detect because there is no victim of crime especially when both parties involved are satisfied
4939737 some are reluctant to give evidence there needs to be certain kinds of internal control and we cannot afford failure
4939738 the duration and work of investigators depend on the complexity of the case and sometimes the most difficult can be syndicate corruption involving a lot of people
4939739 investigations can be time consuming but investigators have to get evidence
4939740 i feel i need to contribute to society i like to see a government to be a clean one where everyone can enjoy a fair field to play if corruption exists some rights of people will be intruded on but being an investigator is a meaningful task
4939741 for me to share my experiences and knowledge with ficac investigators is great the motives behind ficac is a great one and you can see the political willingness of the government really wants this country to be a corruption free society
4939742 i would have become the prime minister if i wished to become president

4939759 at this time in my life i thought i would be on a cruise ship to panama or the mediterranean retired with my tilley hats my sneakers but im a single lady now and i want to keep working
4939760 i want it to flow into the classic material seamlessly
4939761 that became very confusing some people really enjoyed it and some just wanted us to get on with the story
4939762 over the years ellys nose grew up to the size of a potato now im drawing it smaller again the way it was when i first started to draw there is a huge difference between the earlier and the later styles
4939763 how old would you be if you didnt know how old you were
4939764 but so much of it dies and my gardens look like they were planted by a crazy person
4939765 this is unusual in that its almost 100 percent focused on featuring baltimore artists
4939766 it was the direction of the baltimore development corp and the baltimore hotel corp and hilton embraced it it helps create a visual memory of the place so people know theyre in baltimore and not another city
4939767 people will stop and look and ask what is this about
4939768 if i learned one thing over my time with henry bonwiller its that mass politics is an emotional struggle above all a primal battle that is more charismatic and animalistic than either ethical or reason
4939769 i cant even begin to tell you how strange and wonderful and great its been
4939770 just getting to meet george lucas was pretty amazing and then working with him and getting to be part of this process its a great responsibility i feel like my job is to bring his universe to the screen and make sure it lives up to the standards hes set
4939771 i go to the conventions and talk to the fans and i tell them no you dont understand i am one of you and i really am
4939772 this is what i wear when i go out in the wilderness
4939773 figure out a balance between the rabid green aspects which is just let them be and the real impact there is on cattlemen
4939774 you can get a way from a lot of things up there but then you know making a star wars movie is the sort of pressure you cant forget about for too long
4939775 we feel that we have created a place that is the essence of baltimore and could be nowhere else but baltimore
4939776 i just love the fair business and think its the greatest thing in the world
4939777 id love to have a farm with hampshire sheep hampshire pigs and angus cattle
4939778 i collect lots of things i was an auctioneer prior to being with the fair and i did a lot of antiques and it was a lot of fun
4939779 i think that would help the racing industry which is hurting in maryland
4939780 id like to see where the hampshire pigs and sheeps are from i raised them as a kid and ive always been fascinated by them
4939781 so then well make sure that we four always are the strongest one thing for us four
4939782 if youre willing to die in that water im willing to die myself to win
4939783 if it came down to you and me you would beat me easily im one of the weakest players
4939784 fashion is very important to me in fact its a priority every day is a fashion show
4939785 i shop too much others would say but indeed shopping is my passion a time where i can express myself i shop ridiculously every chance i get i mean come on fashion is always evolving just as much as new faces in the modeling industry a true fashionista is always up to date
4939786 i walk into a store and decide quickly if this where i need to be if it is i will shortly be surprised with something fresh and different that catches my eye unfortunately money isnt a big factor if i like it my name is written all over it if it is an expensive brand like dolce and gabbana im definitely looking for a bargain if it isnt then shop on
4939787 my lovely mother and grandmother i would like to compare myself to my favorite fashion icon kimora lee simmons and her exquisite sense of style why not look your best all the time

4939790 ronnie has left his earthly tour for one of the heavens they need him up there its a little too quiet and pious
4939791 god is lonely for a voice louder than his own
4939792 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades
4939793 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world
4939794 he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
4939795 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshed our unique musical heritage
4939796 he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world
4939797 ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
4939798 is a very very popular guy you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
4939799 bernie always said that he walked alone i dont think that he was alone i think he was walking with jesus ill see you soon bernie
4939800 well i dont want to see you andy garcia sent notes that were read at the ceremony
4939801 michelle and i were so deeply sad to hear about your loss he made us laugh and laugh hard
4939802 this shows support from the whole chicago area and how much he will be missed
4939803 if she had accepted what was on the table she would have been hailed as a hero
4939804 said if i can get that i can get more
4939805 what we brought back to her from him was what we thought she would accept
4939806 as i look back she managed us very carefully then when she got with the lawyers it was a whole different deal
4939807 but we are learned people people who are respected and we came away from that meeting and subsequent phone contacts believing that what we said to the mayor was what shed require
4939808 i believe that the mayor has accepted responsibility for the things that he is able to or that he feels he is guilty of doing
4939809 i think he has accepted those responsibilities for things he thinks hes wrong in
4939810 i think that prosecutor worthy is in a very unique position because right now we need some leadership to be displayed that is willing to heal our community
4939811 our community is being torn apart weve got families that are divided on this issue and churches that are divided
4939812 the nations largest african american electoral base has reached a state of paralysis it has come to a point where the mayors personal problems are overshadowing anything he has to say regarding the city we have long resisted calls and other requests to urge detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick to resign because of his mountainous legal troubles but no more
4939813 birds would never learn to fly if mama did not boot them out of the nest usually from a tree and sometimes they cling to the branch so tenaciously that mama has to peck at their little claws until they release and flap their wings
4939814 what really needs to happen is to somehow get past this
4939815 im the pastor of the mayor i am his shepherd and a shepherd is supposed to protect his sheep
4939816 were not asking that the mayor not receive any punishment if hes wrong however we dont want to kill him we want him to live and work and provide for his family it just seems to me that that shouldnt be hard for us to do
4939817 it was bothering him at the point where he needed to get it checked out
4939818 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4939819 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4939820 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4939821 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4939822 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4939823 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4939824 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4939825 its been such an unbelievable ride with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
4939826 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional all i want to do is go see my mom
4939827 to be honest i was thinking not to blow the lead
4939828 i was really nervous going into this race i just wanted to take it out as hard as i could and hold on as strong as i could
4939829 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4939830 i think awareness is pretty good now but were short of remedies
4939831 we need that sense of urgency for people to ask for coupons and then make sure they know how to use the converter boxes
4939832 were sort of at the last mile its the last most difficult households we need to reach to get information to them
4939833 for folks that havent gone the converter box route we encourage them to request coupons now and when they come in three weeks redeem them immediately to make sure the coupon doesnt expire
4939834 if we can succeed here then we can succeed in other cities and hopefully new york city
4939835 whether e ha does it or not this is the future
4939836 i can text message to make a reservation so i dont waste time
4939837 what are we doing with fancy cell phones if it doesnt bring us information and give us choices and save us money
4939838 its like killing cockroaches but killing everything else too youre exterminating everything

4939845 providing clean water for our citizens is one of the most important and least visible jobs of the county
4939846 thanks to steve we have been able to accomplish this goal while also cutting costs
4939847 steve single handedly prevented water restrictions in the annapolis area last summer
4939848 his changes also prevented a service loss after a water main break and made it possible for our infrastructure to keep up with growing demand in the service area without a facility upgrade
4939849 we wanted to make an effort to meet them in their communities
4939850 it sends an honest and clear message that were interested
4939851 we wanted to reach out where theres that technology gap
4939852 any kind of connection you can make before the school year starts is good
4939853 im happy because it feels like i hadnt seen them in so many years
4939854 as long as it takes if i have to be here 20 years ill be here 20 years
4939855 we see her pain and her quest for answers but in suicide cases we often cant give those answers
4939856 its very common for relatives to have a difficult time accepting how their loved one died all we can do is make sure we covered every base and be as thorough as we can and try to provide the family with answers
4939857 i talked to him the day after christmas and he was as happy as hed ever been
4939858 hed reached a point at work and in life where he didnt have anything to prove he was content
4939859 shes produced multiple claims that we cannot document or substantiate some of which quite frankly arent even believable
4939860 you have to take a look at the overall facts and scenarios and determine if any of those claims and allegations are accurate or even make sense and fit the crime scene the only reasonable conclusion that you can come to is that this was a suicide
4939861 maam do you realize your brother blew his brains out
4939862 i fear he is looking for a way to escape going back to britain
4939863 we are very worried he might be returning and the checks are not good enough
4939864 i am sure we dont need him here the government must alert all the entry points they have power to stop anyone
4939865 he will try to return because there is no law and order here the police judiciary everyone can be bought
4939866 the kids are great because they come up with things you wouldnt expect them to because theyve never seen the medium before
4939867 its beautiful its a glass mosaic with a very artistic view of the city skyline
4939868 she is really quite a leader in the fused glass field
4939869 she combines the elements very well she explores every direction she really thinks out of the box
4939870 shes high energy but very laid back and gets along with all ages
4939871 the tension has eased considerably there is no more confrontation
4939872 your rent of 1 200 month for a 1 bed unit at 625 n grand ave santa ana ca 92701 is very close to the median rent in your area
4939873 my being there says that all jews take delight in seeing our traditions elevated its a beautiful tradition and a beautiful ceremony and im honored to be a part of it
4939874 kol ami found themselves in a position where merging with nevey shalom would allow them to flourish
4939875 they worked the issues through very nicely they were really ready
4939876 we think safepass is ideal for adt customers who have their hands full when they come home and need to easily activate their security system
4939877 when we go down to our basements or our garages it makes us as happy as some of the finest art in the world
4939878 but as a bike nut i dont find it hard to justify at all
4939879 you might as well get a bike that just performs really well isnt super fancy and gets the job done because youre going to keep it for a year then throw it away and get a new one
4939880 you would be splitting hairs between a bicycle that cost this much and one that cost half as much
4939881 is for someone who appreciates the aesthetics of bicycles and takes a lot of pride in what theyre riding
4939882 ten years ago 3 000 was a lot of money
4939883 was to get the people who already rode a high priced bike to buy a higher priced bike
4939884 the people driving this high end business arent your typical bike commuter
4939885 they arent helping the environment or saving money by buying these high priced bikes theyre doing it because its a fashion statement for them within their circle of friends and acquaintances who happen to be other bikeys
4939886 to the bumbershoot music and arts festival and the usps on aug 10 last year i received my bumbershoot tickets in the mailbox of my west seattle home they were accompanied by a second bumbershoot envelope addressed correctly to a girl in anderson island how this happened i do not know but in looking up this girl to make sure i got her tickets safely to her i found the absolute love of my life weve been together for one year now and neither one of us has ever been happier thank you
4939887 to all the local and national radio and online news organizations i want to find out for myself what happened in the olympics give a person some warning before you say who won the gold or put it on your sites front page it ruins it completely to know ahead of time
4939888 to the gentleman who offered to give my husband a ride home from the mill creek fred meyer when our car wouldnt start on aug 3 even though it was completely out of your way it was such a wonderfully nice gesture my husband was able to get his car come back and pick me up so that i a pregnant woman at the end of her third trimester wouldnt have to wait hours for a tow truck driver people like you restore my faith in humanity
4939889 to the person who saw my 11 year old english setter on northwest 90th and holman road picked her up and took her to the spca while we had a sleepless night in our house worrying about her whereabouts we cant thank you enough for the huge sigh of relief we got the next morning when we heard her described on the spca lost dog hotline we know you went out of your way to help and we are deeply grateful for your assistance
4939890 to the gentleman at crow restaurant on aug 7 while sitting with his back to us a mere 3 feet away he indiscreetly loudly and forcefully passed prolonged gas while eating dinner with his female companion we didnt know whether to laugh out loud or save our last breath of clean air since neither he nor his companion chuckled flinched blushed or addressed the event it appears that they either suffer from joint hearing loss or that they completely lack the basic politeness and manners one would expect at a public restaurant visit the restroom if you need to relieve the pressure
4939891 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4939892 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
4939893 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4939894 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4939895 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4939896 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4939897 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4939898 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4939899 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4939900 the governments gesture to abbas brings us back to the oslo days during which more than 1 400 were killed and hundreds were wounded by released terrorists
4939901 its the most perfect place on earth and to think that there is talk of giving up sea defences and letting the sea reclaim this area is shameful along the walk is a derelict mill beside a river where you can watch marsh harriers and in the springtime you can hear bitterns booming

4939917 the french revolution and the church property the first phase
4939918 the state of illinois requires manufacturers to reimburse dealers for warranty repairs at the higher retail prices rather than the lower warranty prices the same law allows manufacturers to recover those costs or a portion of those costs through a warranty recovery fee added to the price of the car
4939919 like everything else regarding the price of a new car are negotiable between customer and dealer of course as with all transactions the dealer is under no obligation to give up on any of the numbers
4939920 as more people have access to the internet and get more comfortable online i think we may see more charges like this
4939921 were not talking about protected speech here were talking about things that make the victim feel terrorized threatened or molested
