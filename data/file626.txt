6260009 to be a discriminating user of the internet is one of the most important skills we can give students
6260010 we will need to consider making that a formal part of the education system and students will need to be tested on it that needs to happen and it is very likely to happen in the future
6260011 ringing a friend and sitting for an exam having recourse to the internet or other online technologies would make the running of examinations extremely difficult
6260012 i think that it is interesting to see people being adventurous and exploring new technologies in all areas of learning including assessment
6260013 but the situation that faces most people within nsw is that sooner or later they will be obliged to take examinations that require them to demonstrate rote learning
6260014 i support having some tasks where students can access information from as many different sources as possible including the range of different technologies available
6260015 however knowledge is important and committing information to memory will always have a place in the school curriculum
6260016 that by taking such devices into the exam room they would risk a zero mark in the course
6260017 our growth has been enormous particularly in the uk where our office has grown from three to 15 in the past 12 months and we now have five teachers on staff as trainers
6260018 in 2004 a total of 35 000 students in five countries were using studywiz today we are in 21 countries with 1 2 million students using the platform and we are still growing
6260019 we now have 80 staff located on four continents in more than 16 different locations we are in four states in the us in six locations in britain as well as in germany ireland malaysia hobart and melbourne
6260020 we do three way video chats over broadband internet connections often connecting three continents its fantastic
6260021 this will help us engage at a much higher level with departments of education catholic dioceses and people like that because it is an institution wide application

6260083 once again all very natural thoughts to have however when people are involved emotions run wild and we tend to
6260084 the change you want the organization to make instead of being last to the change party volunteer to model the change im not saying that change is easy but i can tell you that as a leader or rather an aspiring leader i
6260085 im sure youd be able to find a hot japanese guy who looks just like her
6260086 if yossy and junno were falling off a cliff and you could only save one who would it be
6260087 id find a way to save them both and then theyd have to be really grateful
6260088 no hab a terminado de temblar cuando ya estaba con mi agente cuadrando los derechos para la pel cula pero ah mismo vi en las noticias que no hubo ni un muertito una l stima
6260089 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
6260090 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
6260091 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
6260092 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
6260093 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
6260094 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
6260095 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you

6260100 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6260101 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6260102 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6260103 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6260104 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6260105 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6260106 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6260107 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6260108 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6260109 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6260110 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6260111 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6260112 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6260113 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6260114 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6260115 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6260116 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
6260117 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions

6260120 i hate jill stanek with the power of a thousand suns i posted a comment about my own pregnancy crisis on a blog once i was five months pregnant when we discovered that my son could not survive outside of the womb he had no kidneys underdeveloped lungs a hole in his heart fluid on his brain and half of his internal organs were outside of his body because his abdominal wall didnt close properly we were told that no matter what we had a half hour with him tops so we chose to induce labor when i was 27 weeks pregnant because i was such a mess because carrying a fetus that was going to die was the single worst thing ive ever done i was continually leaving work early because i would feel sick i wasnt eating i was barely able to take care of myself and that translated to being barely able to take care of my 14 month old daughter we induced labor and it was horrible but i got to hold my son for a half hour before he passed away and then i got to start putting the pieces back together i grieved and i still grieve but i was able to start the process of moving forward 4 months later i got pregnant again and delivered a happy healthy baby boy about a year after my first son passed away i shared this on a blog and fucking jill stanek took my comment and wrote a post about how i aborted my handicapped child and what a horrible person i was sigh it was the worst time of my life my husband and i chose the best possible option for us out of several shitty options because lets face it when your fetus is not able to live outside of you for more than 30 minutes all of your options pretty much suck and then moved on with our lives while still grieving for the child we lost clearly we are evil evil child murderers it wouldve been so much better for him to spend another 3 months being beaten by my uterus due to my lack of amniotic fluid then to die peacefully in my arms she makes me ill

6260133 at quan sports marketing we will work with various teams on a wide range of duties and eventually focus on a core business that will help athletes with their charitable events and foundations
6260134 i love the aeros and to say that leaving is sad would be a huge understatement
6260135 probably the single biggest accomplishment i can think of while working with the aeros is the privilege of working with the best staff in the ahl
6260136 over the last five years we developed a great sales and working culture here and we passed that along to the fans that really make the aeros what they are today
6260137 now i will get the chance to be my own boss

6260142 if espanyol do finally receive an offer i do not want to miss the opportunity to go to liverpool the option to join a super club doesnt come every day i am a realistic person but this has given me something to look forward to
6260143 to reject the possibility of a move would be madness
6260144 for the players here taking courses or the ones who have graduated that used to be about 30 000 a year and now its more than 75 000
6260145 we had a big meeting in calgary last season to try and address some of these things that are affecting all the teams in the league
6260146 people are being laid off in prince george we understand that and were not going to overcharge for the product
6260147 i believe we have the lowest ticket prices in b c and one of the lowest in the league all while having the worst travel
6260148 my philosophy with this is that i was more disappointed two years ago when we had a very competitive hockey club and made a long run in the playoffs and it didnt translate into anything the next season
6260149 faith tourism has evolved to the point where a gathering of this magnitude is necessary for the industry to respond to the needs of todays faith based consumers
6260150 our global partners recognize that just as in music books and film contemporary religious consumers represent tremendous market potential for travel organizations willing to provide meaningful products and services that meet their specific needs
6260151 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

6260154 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6260155 silvestre will be a very very good signing for us
6260156 i never even thought about him but he is just the type of player we need he has bags of experience and wont cost a lot as he is 31
6260157 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6260158 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6260159 we went with a group last year that saw a lot of icetime and had these kids played on a different hockey club at their age a year ago they wouldnt have seen that kind of icetime thats for sure
6260160 by biting the bullet over the last few months of the season the fruits of their labour and our labour pays off by them coming back with more experience than most players their age
6260161 for everyone winning nine games at home and 11 on the road thats simply unacceptable you have to be very good at home and 500 on the road and we have to make sure from day 1 at camp that we change things around so were not a laughing stock
6260162 theres no question that there was a time when teams came into prince george and they were happy with a split
6260163 we have to get back to that teams dont like to take the long trip up here so we have to make sure what happens on the ice in games isnt the easiest part of that trip thats a mentality we have to put in place from the first day of camp
6260164 changing the camp is part of it but weve had a great response to the invitations we sent out
6260165 its been awhile since we had a guy come into camp out of nowhere and make the team and were hoping we have some guys who can come in and push if they dont make the team maybe they can make their way onto our 50 player list
6260166 we knew there were some issues but i think eventually well get him here
6260167 his dogs were fighting and he ended up getting cut hes got stitches on his hands and well find out more if there might be any problems with tendons that kind of thing
6260168 it doesnt look like its any worse than a few cuts but hes going to see his doctor
6260169 its also important that we stress offshore drinking particularly on spring breaks and free up leases for bars in previously protected locations across america it would be a tremendous psychological boost to the economy
6260170 without it i dont think i would have been able to finish fifth from the last in my naval academy class later in life i dont know how else i wouldve had the courage to get back in the saddle after losing five jets
6260171 i have three kids i know im going to make at least one trip to the er every year and that pays for my aflac
6260172 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6260173 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6260174 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6260175 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6260176 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6260177 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6260178 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6260179 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6260180 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6260181 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6260182 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6260183 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6260184 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6260185 the company is on track to deliver double digit growth in npat looking forward creating improved shareholder value and delivering world class services and assets to our clients
6260186 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6260187 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6260188 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6260189 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6260190 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6260191 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6260192 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6260193 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6260194 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6260195 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6260196 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6260197 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6260198 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6260199 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6260200 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6260201 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6260202 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6260203 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6260204 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6260205 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6260206 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6260207 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6260208 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6260209 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6260210 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6260211 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6260212 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6260213 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6260214 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6260215 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6260216 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6260217 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6260218 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6260219 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6260220 here i am standing in front of our front door on my first day of school
6260221 yes you should pick him up from the gas station down the street i know its strange but they moved the location
6260222 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6260223 this is a planning took where all things are going
6260224 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6260225 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6260226 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6260227 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6260228 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6260229 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6260230 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6260231 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6260232 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6260233 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6260234 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6260235 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6260236 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6260237 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6260238 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6260239 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6260240 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6260241 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6260242 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6260243 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6260244 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6260245 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6260246 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6260247 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6260248 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6260249 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6260250 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6260251 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6260252 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6260253 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6260260 has historically had one of the worst run prison systems in the nation treating inmates like caged animals only to see them released back into their communities angrier and more bitter than they originally were
6260261 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6260262 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6260263 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6260264 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6260265 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6260266 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6260267 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

6260302 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6260303 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6260304 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6260305 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6260306 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6260307 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6260308 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6260309 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6260310 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6260311 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6260312 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6260313 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6260314 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6260315 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6260316 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6260318 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6260319 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6260320 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6260321 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6260322 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6260323 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6260324 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6260325 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6260329 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6260330 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno

6260332 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6260333 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6260334 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6260335 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6260336 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6260337 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6260338 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6260339 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6260340 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6260341 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6260342 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6260343 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6260344 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6260345 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6260346 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6260347 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6260353 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6260354 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6260355 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6260356 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6260357 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6260358 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6260359 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6260360 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6260361 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6260362 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6260363 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6260364 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6260365 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6260366 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6260367 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6260368 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6260369 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6260370 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6260371 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6260372 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6260373 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6260374 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6260375 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6260376 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6260377 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6260378 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6260379 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6260402 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6260403 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6260404 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6260405 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6260406 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6260413 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6260414 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6260415 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6260416 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6260417 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6260418 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6260419 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6260420 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6260426 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6260427 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6260435 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6260436 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6260437 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6260438 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

6260440 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6260441 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6260444 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6260450 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6260451 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6260452 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6260453 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6260454 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6260455 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6260456 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6260457 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6260458 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6260459 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6260460 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6260461 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6260462 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6260465 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6260466 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6260467 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6260468 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6260469 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6260470 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6260471 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6260472 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6260473 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6260474 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6260500 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6260501 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6260502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6260503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6260504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6260505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6260506 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6260507 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6260508 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6260510 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6260511 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6260512 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6260513 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6260514 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6260515 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6260516 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6260517 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6260518 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6260519 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6260520 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6260521 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6260522 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6260523 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6260524 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6260525 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6260526 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6260527 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6260528 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6260529 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6260530 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6260531 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6260532 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6260533 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6260534 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6260535 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6260536 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6260537 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6260538 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6260539 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6260540 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6260541 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6260542 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6260543 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6260544 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6260545 i read the first half dozen issues of air and enjoyed them no end it starts as rushdie and then parachutes off into pynchon

6260548 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6260549 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6260550 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6260551 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6260558 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6260559 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6260560 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well
6260561 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

6260637 the somali mission hiding behind diplomatic status continues to drag its feet in repairing this rundown property
6260638 the residents of new rochelle deserve better and the city should not be burdened with the responsibility of fixing the physical hazards or reducing the visual eyesores the time has come for either the somali mission to own up to its liability or for the state department to revoke the propertys diplomatic status

6260640 it is time for the trans atlantic community to establish a credible energy security strategy that diversifies energy sources for all europe establishes a collective framework to work with russia and refuses to tolerate the use of energy as an instrument of coercion
6260641 the absence of a collective energy security strategy will lead to greater fragmentation among european nations and across the atlantic this fragmentation will not be exclusive to energy policy it may also detrimentally impact our ability to act upon shared security and economic issues

6260645 we know that our seniors are even more likely to claim the standard deduction on their tax returns and were hoping that this will provide relief to those who may have fixed or limited incomes but still carry the burden of property taxes even better well provide this break without depleting the resources brought in by property taxes that help communities build schools and provide a quality education for our children
6260646 among the economic challenges millions of new jerseyans and americans face during this downturn along with rising gas prices food costs and college tuition is high property taxes
6260647 hundreds of thousands of new jersey residents will now receive some relief for the property taxes they pay
6260648 it is totally unacceptable for lenders to attempt to exploit legal loopholes to foreclose on the homes of active duty servicemembers my legislation would ensure that no servicemembers ever have to worry about losing their homes while they fight for their country federal regulators should crack down on these lenders and protect the men and women in uniform who do so much to protect all of us

6260653 over the past eight years the bush administration has staged an assault on the environmental protections that provide us with the clean air and water we need together we have fought hard against the special interests to win major battles in the effort to protect our environment and i stand ready for the fights to come
6260654 i am proud to receive such a positive rating from environment new jersey and am eager to continuing to work together to preserve our planet tackle global warming and create the smart clean energy policies our country needs
6260655 new jerseys senators and a majority of our congressmen time and again have stood up for the environment and pushed real clean energy solutions for our energy crisis
6260656 being green in the garden state is a bipartisan issue and we applaud our delegations environmental heroes especially the leadership from sen menendez and sen lautenberg
6260657 sometimes you just have to admit that you didnt do your homework as well as you might have thought
6260658 this is really good news it was more than i expected
6260659 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
6260660 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish
6260661 tax rebates peter out building a new bridge helps the economy long after the work is done
6260662 you dont want to spend money on fireworks or a monument to the mayor
6260663 but construction projects create a lot of employment thats what lags in modern recessions
6260664 we dont really have a lot of wiggle room in terms of annual budget
6260665 weve fared relatively well in comparison to other agencies and departments
6260666 our salaries and fuel and so forth thats about 86 percent of the total budget like i said theres not a lot of wiggle room
6260667 glacier has been the hidden gem of the national park service for a long time
6260668 we definitely havent been able to capture all our fuel costs
6260669 every time we have a vacancy we review it carefully do we really need this position
6260670 we think we might be in line for funding in 2010 or 2011
6260671 you try to focus on the things that present the most hazard
6260672 beyond that theres just so much its hard for me to be specific its a notebook full a big three ringed binder
6260673 but its hard to know because prices have gone up so much in the last two years
6260674 divide six into 400 million and thats how long its going to take to fix everything that needs fixing in this park
6260675 but its an avenue the biggest problem is we have to compete every year so its hard to know what the future holds
6260676 its nice to see that our work is going to be used by the community and will have a purpose added cady greene another student
6260677 i remember frank means traveling to washington d c with his jugs of brown water tucked under his arm and bringing forward the just cause of past and future generations to secure a clean supply of drinking water twenty years later we are now realizing that promise i am proud to have been a part of this effort and promise to keep up the fight until it is finished clean reliable drinking water is crucial to helping these communities remain healthy and growing
6260678 fsa offices are important to communities with a strong agricultural economic base like kadoka in a time where gas prices are hitting our farmers we must do all that we can to help producers conveniently access usda programs
6260679 my work to keep jackson countys fsa office open is only one way to help keep things on track in jackson county i look forward continuing to work with mayor weller to find economic development opportunities to help kadoka grow
6260680 all federal funds previously earmarked for the mississippi department of transportation study or studies of improvements to state hwy 22 from edwards to canton and from vicksburg to canton be re directed to the reunion interchange
6260681 it wasnt a very popular topic then i doubt it would be much more popular now either with american audiences or japanese ones but for me personally it was a fascinating experience to get to make that movie and be directed by one of the all time greats
6260682 i didnt go into it with any great anxiety i thought and i knew i could lose the weight it was a commitment id made it was part of the assignment
6260683 i also didnt have any trepidations about being able to regain the weight i did consult with a nutritionist but to me it wasnt any particularly huge or scary undertaking what i have to admit was rather scary or offputting was viewing what i looked like watching the movie as a third person i looked dreadful the look of anorexia is frightening because its based on unnatural deprivation and of course it makes older people think of the concentration camps of the innocent victims that is from the nazi era
6260684 with the four we have and many more expected a marketing initiative was needed
6260685 i began by contacting all the partners and let them know how exactly they could be involved
6260686 a grant was written and approved to begin the initiative
6260687 virginia tourism will match our 3 250 from the partners giving us a grand total of 6 500 for the budget
6260688 they had kind of a tie in part working on the fort to sea trail
6260689 where that piece of property is the old stage coach road intersects with perkins lane it would be a part of the trail that people could stay on a bicycle
6260690 when we moved into this space a few months ago everyone came in with stories of the old businesses here
6260691 the tin ceiling is still the original all we did was cover with it a coat of paint
6260692 i think its important to keep the look its part of the heritage of our town
6260693 at that time it was rare for a woman to own property
6260694 but edith owned it and ran a millinery shop inside she would travel to baltimore every year and check out the latest hats but all of hers were handmade
6260695 i remember a hat rack that was right next to the door
6260696 every time mrs chamberlin would leave for church she would take a different hat off to wear
6260697 there would be about 200 people in the small room
6260698 supposedly a man came in upset because his wife was flirting with another man and shot a hole right through the ceiling into the upstairs apartment
6260699 it was said to have hit right next to a baby sleeping in a crib
6260700 i have yet to find the bullet hole but they say its here

6260712 tugas pertamamu adalah menyelamatkan salahsatu dari agen mca midgard central agency badan intelijen milik pemerintah republik rune midgard yang memiliki nama sandi rubah
6260713 junon istilah bagi mca menugaskan rubah ke turkjiyan selama setahun untuk memata matai aktivitas militer pasukan pendudukan kekaisaran galbadia disana dengan menyamar sebagai wartawan namun sialnya ia dipergoki oleh elemen patroli dari divisi infantri ke 201 ketika melakukan tugas intelijennya di kota primea murkovii sayang sekali padahal setelah tugas di kota primea murkovii selesai ia akan kembali ke tanah air untuk melepas rindu dengan istri dan putrid semata wayangnya

6260722 as a parent of a son with autism i know how frustrated ive been at the lack of a coordinated state response to this epidemic
6260723 the same vague ideas the same vague measurements the same vague recommendations as 1996 im really disgusted because to me these people are part of the problem here
6260724 whatever were doing now is preparation for work that we come into the legislative session prepared to do rather than doing a study for the sake of doing a study and setting it on a shelf and not paying attention to it
6260725 it is absolutely critical both in maintaining quality and from a human ethics standpoint for any organization that claims to serve a particular segment of the population to have members of that segment of the population at the policy level of that organization you must include actual autistic individuals on your committee moving forward
6260726 all it says is explore specific health insurance coverage i think it needs to say develop and pass insurance legislation that covers physician directed intensive treatments for asd
6260727 and i said what would you do if you had a child with this disability their response was i would move i would leave the state

6260730 im skinny but im tough we will hit back hard with the truth we will answer any lies that are made and we intend to win this election
6260731 we cant have the same kind of shoot first and aim second approach in our foreign policy weve got to have some kind of judgment in our foreign policy and restore our alliances around the world
6260732 tendency is to shoot first and to ask questions later
6260733 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war in iraq that had nothing to do with 9 11
6260734 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6260735 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6260736 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i am questioning his patriotism
6260737 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6260738 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6260739 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children

6260745 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6260746 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6260747 in the midst of a furious war where dead white men are common and the death of a free black woman carries less weight than that of a horsefly for when the horsefly meets its end it ceases to be an irritant you imagine that you will find her killer
6260748 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6260749 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
6260750 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6260751 john mccain lets face it he has a compelling biography
6260752 he is a pow and so that is what people kind of think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bush has been doing for the last eight years
6260753 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6260754 o jornalismo o mundo do trabalho e a liberdade de imprensa
6260755 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6260756 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6260757 for dressing me in this you will walk the plank

6260761 my roommate knew where i was going to meet them i drove myself to and from and it was a public location
6260762 no i dont think its riskier heres the thing working in a prosecutors office i got to see a lot of ugliness up close and personal and some of it was between boyfriend girlfriend or spouses id be willing to bet that the bulk of those people didnt meet online there are risks online and in real life being in a relationship requires that you take a risk i dont think one risk is greater than another
6260763 i always kept the initial meeting casual although some coffee or drink dates turned into dinner or walks
6260764 politicians are the same all over they promise to build a bridge where there is no river
6260765 next weeks democratic convention is in denver colorado just 220 miles from thompsons former home in aspen the creator of gonzo journalism wont be there in person but his addictive spirit will certainly make an appearance
6260766 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6260767 this has great potential as a screening tool the detection of these volatile organic compounds could make a major contribution to diagnosis

6260769 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters
6260770 the dip in support for obama who would be the first black u s president cut across demographic and ideological lines he slipped among catholics born again christians women independents and younger voters

6260776 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
6260777 we need to keep the young people off the streets
6260778 and the parents need help the law is the law
6260779 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
6260780 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones

6260792 they come out here and play around in the snow the reality is this is our livelihood
6260793 we always expect the worst hope for the best and take everything in between
6260794 you can do all things through christ who strengthens you
6260795 once upon a time we were kids but the neighborhood didnt offer things like this i decided to start doing something to give back in our community
6260796 this morning the parents were saying how thankful they were for them
6260797 this is a normal workday for us so im taking a hit for them and that shows that i appreciate them
6260798 i know there are parents who have to buy school supplies and pay for lunches so this helps them

6260800 os oper rios est o fazendo dos dois lados ao mesmo tempo eles deveriam come ar um lado e depois de terminar um come ar o outro porque realmente fica dif cil para o pedestre e antes de terminar essa primeira parte eles j est o quebrando na frente do shopping est uma bagun a muita poeira e nada de finalizar a obra
6260801 o pedestre n o consegue passar uma mulher caiu aqui nesses dias e quase quebrou a perna est ruim o certo fazer primeiro um lado para depois come ar l na frente eles j pararam de trabalhar em uma parte e a cal ada est toda esburacada
6260802 o risco muito grande porque os nibus agora passam pela rua ent o perigoso para o pedestre o fluxo de ve culos aumentou com carretas e nibus passando ao mesmo tempo nessa rua estreita
6260803 eu s soube que aqui era um ponto de nibus porque havia muitas pessoas no local porque sinaliza o n o tem a gente que improvisou todos ficaram no mesmo lugar e as pessoas depois souberam que era um ponto de nibus

6260818 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6260819 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6260820 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6260821 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6260822 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6260823 its a good time for the team to really jell together because after the third one its two more weeks and youre playing for real
6260824 collectively the winning projects exhibit conceptual strength and address aesthetic civic urban and social concerns as well as the requisite programmatic functional and sustainability concerns of a healthcare facility

6260826 currently we have flights from chennai delhi and mumbai to brussels and those planes go beyond to us and canada we were planning to link bangalore and ahmedabad to brussels and now the bangalore link will happen first for obvious reasons

6260831 the american people already hate this war and now mccain wants to sacrifice all our children to continue it
6260832 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century

6260838 a key pillar of the u s strategy to pacify iraq is in danger of collapsing
6260839 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6260840 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6260841 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go bacck to zero i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6260842 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6260843 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6260844 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6260845 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6260846 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6260847 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6260848 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6260849 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6260855 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
6260856 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6260857 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6260858 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6260865 the business brought in two of the most prominent defense attorneys in the country and the business owner was convicted
6260866 this prosecutor showed that you can win a conviction on just regular hard core pornography
6260867 youve got a small town prosecutor winning so why cant the justice department win
6260868 its the same type of material that they could be prosecuting its the same defense attorneys juries are juries whether you have one in a small town or a federal jury it doesnt matter this prosecutor showed us something and hes to be congratulated

6260910 alle bedrijven die personeel tewerkstellen worden niet alleen met een vrij forse stijging van de energieprijzen maar ook nog eens met een aanzienlijke stijging van de loonkosten tengevolge van het indexmechanisme geconfronteerd heel wat kleine bedrijven hebben een te kleine financi le buffer om het niet volledig kunnen doorrekenen van de toegenomen kosten aan de klanten op te vangen
6260911 een explosieve combinatie met mogelijk ernstige gevolgen voor de economie
6260912 never seen anything like it a perfect amalamation of creativity
6260913 sometimes we forget that boys are just as concerned about their body image as girls and again smoking and reducing your height is perhaps something that boys dont really want to see happen to them
6260914 its important to take the responsibility that goes with the privilege of having a drivers licence seriously in order to avoid preventable incidents that may have disastrous consequences
6260915 last months general election changed the government but little else
6260916 women detained by police forced to remove bras after demo
6260917 kid im going to put you in the cell i want your wallet and your belt
6260918 obie i can understand you wanting my wallet so i dont have any money to spend in the cell but what do you want my belt for
6260919 obie did you think i was going to hang myself for littering
6260920 folks in dover arent sure about evolution here in new jersey were counting on it
6260921 for a couple weeks ive been trying to go outside in the poor weather without a jacket to get myself ready mentally and physically
6260922 my mom and dad are in florida right now and they think im crazy because its 20 degrees over there and ill be sleeping in minus 20 degree weather
6260923 but they understand where im coming from and why i want to do this
6260924 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
6260925 i wasnt the richest kid on the block or the one with the nicest clothes i always felt alone that i had nobody to turn to
6260926 my whole life i said i should do something and i never did this is my last year in high school nows the time
6260927 it looked like a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders
6260928 this tells us there was no beacon of light out there
6260929 and all of a sudden there was the boys stood up for down home values
6260930 we decided to wait till shes born and then were going to get a look at her and well probably keep debating it
6260931 cant they see that the grinch in my story is the hero of christmas sure he starts out as a villain but its not how you start out that counts its what you are at the finish
6260932 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6260933 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6260934 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6260935 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6260936 i have never suggested that picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6260937 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6260938 you have time in prison to reflect on your choices and on how gandhi and mandela used their jail terms they grew as humans rejected revenge and resentment and emerged to change the world
6260939 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch
6260940 we definitely wonder what it would be like to have another hopefully knock on wood someday
6260941 were very happy things couldnt be better were kind of taking it easy and just kind of enjoying a little downtime at home
6260942 the pain cry is usually high pitched loud and of sudden onset and includes long periods of breath holding
6260943 most six sigma and lean training is based around thinking from 20 years ago based on successes in motorola and ge we wanted to take an up to the minute look at what makes a successful programme today
6260944 as the use of the lean six sigma methodology and tools are growing quickly researching its success factors is important to make sure that lean six sigma is not misused and so continues to have a high positive impact
6260945 lean six sigma practice has enormous potential to improve business performance how the training of professionals in tools and success factors takes place and the implementation of these in practice is currently an under researched area it should be a concern of all leading researchers and training organisations in this area to ensure that it is performed correctly in order to maximise its impact
6260946 i think practitioners are more critical and focus not only on how well the deployment is accepted but also on how well their internal processes are working eg project selection review sessions bb development etc
6260947 sponsors on the other hand are happy to see positive results and focus less on the process side
6260948 when the general electric heuristic for making initiatives work e q x a effectiveness of the programme is a function of its technical quality times its cultural acceptance is considered it can be seen that there is a fairly even split between cultural and technical factors this implies that the people aspects of any improvement programme are as important as the technical tools and techniques used this is why we at sigmapro spend a lot of time in our training on change management
6260949 in my experience they are often reluctant to do this
6260950 and this has a significant negative impact on initiative success
6260951 we couldnt get this bloody ferret out so i dug this hole and i stuck
6260952 he got his hand on the rabbit and you know you have to pull it to
6260953 i said jack youre meant to break its neck not rip its head off

6260957 this team has really bonded and what we want to do is utilize a crisis like this and make it better we want to take something really bad and turn it into something wonderful
6260958 absolutely happy customer goods as descrbed and arrived promptly a
6260959 101 dinge die man getan haben sollte bevor das leben vorbei ist
6260960 what are you doing for rosh hashana jewish new year
6260961 i taught them everything they know but not everything i know
6260962 the original was built in 1847 in quebec but this one was built about five years ago in kerry
6260963 in the 1840s it would have carried maybe 200 emigrants on each journey these would have been whole families and people in very poor circumstances
6260964 the bunks would have been very close together they would really be packed in like sardines and if the weather was right they would take turns coming on deck and getting some fresh air
6260965 as you can imagine it could get pretty fetid down there
6260966 the emigrants that came onto this ship were fed because that was included in their deal
6260967 no one ever died on this ship in fact its actually plus one because one woman had a child on board which is unique i imagine
6260968 and the trainees get a feel of what a famine ship was like and also the feel of a sailing ship
6260969 its a great opportunity and anyone who has taken part has always been very happy with it
6260970 were one of very few actual wooden sailing ships many of them now have steel hulls which are very efficient but this is one of very few such ships left
6260971 weve just come from galway and on wednesday well head for larne and then onto dublin on our tour of ireland
6260972 later this year well head for spain and then back to kerry
6260973 i suppose people think its just a fad or something and ill go and get a real job one day but no this is it
6260974 i think the wheel up on the very back was the best bit because i got to turn it around
6260975 i was a bit afraid it would actually turn the ship away but it was anchored down
6260976 i dont think i would have liked going to america with my family i think it would have been really scary
6260977 will that be the motto come to my university drink as much as you can as long as you pay your tuition do you think you send your son or daughter to come home as an alcoholic thats a bad message im sorry you have enough time to drink the rest of your life
6260978 you think the president of the university is gonna open a beer hall in his house do you think the coach of the baseball team or football team will open it up they should raise their standards and think that drinking is not part of college life everybody has responsibility on this and drinking at universities isnt something you should be proud of you dont send your son or daughter to learn how to drink at universities you send em for an education
6260979 students at colleges and universities across the country and unfortunately at many high schools are already drinking despite the fact that the lawful age is 21 they drink in private they drink in hiding they sometimes go off campus to places to drink that are dangerous they may drive while doing that
6260980 there is a real argument that needs to be considered about whether it would be safer for them to drink lawfully on campus where responsible use of alcohol could be modeled
6260981 ive seen many people who lost their family life because their father or mother drank they died at an early age it should not be so whimsical that universities think they should drop the drinking age
6260982 dado el precio y la ausencia del patrocinio de una empresa de telefon a en estados unidos creemos que las ventas iniciales del treo pro ser n limitadas
6260983 pese al crecimiento en este mercado el 90 por ciento del mercado no posee un tel fono inteligente no tiene sentido pelear por el 10 por ciento
6260984 queremos estar al alcance de la gente que no tiene un tel fono inteligente no de la gente que ya ama a rim
6260985 this camera can only take up to 8 mp resolution images
6260986 it still is the preseason one its important like you said to make it back to show he can tough it out but if its a situation where its not going to help us or help him then you probably dont do that we just have to see i know hes a tough kid he has a legitimate injury hes pushing hard to get back
6260987 you dont want to get a label as an injury prone guy the tough thing for him is a lot of them have been legitimate injuries sometimes there is just nothing you can do about that thats part of the game maybe this is the last one and hell go on a 15 year streak and never get hurt again you really dont know
6260988 fortunately we had the otas and minicamps and had a lot of time there where we were able to get our timing down and things like that
6260989 hes been a little bit in and out here in training camp but i really dont foresee it being a problem
6260990 the hard thing in evaluating that right now is he hasnt had some of the opportunities that some of the other guys have had just in terms of where the ball has been caught and the blocking that weve had for him giving him a chance to show what he can do
6260991 we need to get him more repetitions this week to see where hes at we dont have a no 1 punt returner right now
6260992 provide students scholars and college sport practitioners with a public forum to discuss relevant and timely intercollegiate athletics issues
6260993 oh you silly child with your ten hour sleep a night it gets so much worse
6260994 it probably costs taxpayers over 100 an hour to have two police officers sitting in a squad car with the engine running there
6260995 but there is no reason to have a police squad car idling on this quiet residential street a short distance away you have to take your life into your hands trying to traverse busy westminster street on a crosswalk thats where there have been accidents and where the police presence is needed
6260996 although montreal west public works department has easily found the time to erect a traffic barrier where there was no traffic to speak of and to change the signage on that barrier three times in five weeks they cannot find the time to repaint essential crosswalks obliterated by last winters snow its almost the end of august now this is mismanagement
6260997 some of westminster street intersections at sherbrooke ainslie and avon are very confusing at the best of times and without the painted lines to guide motorists these are quite dangerous there are no traffic lights in montreal west and this makes painted lines all that more important it is incredible that montreal west mayor campbell stuart is so obsessed with erecting and enforcing an unneeded barrier that he is blind to where the real traffic problems are
6260998 you really dont have any evidence of exactly what was going on there whether or not they were filling out their paperwork whether or not those people going through the door were legal or illegal
6260999 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6261000 c mo est el asunto ese de la foto que les entregaron
6261001 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters

6261231 i wasnt sure i wanted to work with him because it seemed like his songs on past albums were so dreary and that he was in a lot of pain so many of the artists i work with can be like that and i can only take so much but when i heard the demos i was immediately struck with the way the new songs were written there was a positive attitude it was an autobiographical album and the stories were really really interesting
6261232 i happened to get there just before soundcheck and the band was onstage fooling around playing some punk songs hearing that plus the demos convinced me that alejandro was capable of a great rock record i was just thrilled cause this was the kind of album i wanted to make when i spoke with him afterwards i told him that i wasnt going to let him record more somber acoustic songs and go back to what hed done before those days are behind him it was time for him to rock again
6261233 ive worked with a lot of people who just write songs but alejandro goes a lot deeper hes able to put his soul into his voice when he sings
6261234 hes technically not the greatest singer in the world but he makes your body resonate with the meaning of the song hes a true artist
6261235 well you guys were here about 15 minutes i normally charge about 35 bucks for an hour but

6261237 i am pleased with the work of the fmfada over the past 18 months to create a plan for fort monroe that ensures this spectacular and historic property will be enjoyed by many generations to come
6261238 i also am pleased that the process to create the reuse plan has included many community and regional leaders experts in historic preservation and economic development the city of hampton and the national park service
6261239 we made a pact to try and process everything thats happening as much as we can to not take it for granted
6261240 it seems like theres something new that happens every single day theres never going to be another time like this in our career and were soaking it up as much as possible were meeting as many people and shaking as many hands as we can its about getting the music in peoples hands
6261241 there it was under new releases right between james otto and mariah carey
6261242 i was so overcome with emotion not only because i had worked my whole life for this but because of how much wed worked since we got together these songs were our babies i cant tell you how overwhelming this was i just lost it
6261243 the fans come up after the show where were selling merch and signing stuff cause we always try to do that and ask where it is and are almost visibly angry that its not out yet
6261244 so were really anxious for aug 26 to get here so that the record can be out and these fans that are really wantin to have the song and the whole cd can pick it up
6261245 two three years ago there was a time when our bus driver hated me cause if we were in the south i sat up next to him and said hey man have you seen a waffle house until we found a waffle house so it could be two in the morning itd be four im still saying dude i really want a waffle house the waffle house is awesome the best part of the waffle house is no matter what time you go there theres always some really great characters in there

6261292 when you are defending 142 you try to stop runs and pick up wickets we tried different things and picked up wickets when we needed them
6261293 we were just one wicket away from making inroads into their tail but the partnership between dhoni and badrinath took the game away from us
6261294 the 60 runs they put together was the difference they batted really well in a situation like that you cant do too many things you have to stop the runs and attack as well but it didnt work for us today
6261295 that was our target anything above would have been a great score
6261296 we had to make sure we didnt lose too many wickets upfront keep wickets in hand and drag the game as much as possible
6261297 at the start of the series i said batting was the most important thing for us weve got to put runs on the board
6261298 we have good bowlers who can create opportunities but to do that we need to be consistent with the bat on a wicket like this you have to really struggle for your runs and work hard but we didnt dig in deep and fight really hard
6261299 the wickets are very fresh here because you dont play that much cricket throughout the year
6261300 whenever we play an international game the pitches always have something in it for the bowlers you cant complain its a good challenge for the cricketers theres no point playing on really flat tracks and scoring 300 runs we need to play on these kinds of wickets its just that it does a little bit with the new ball and then settles in once you get in its a very good wicket to bat on the ball comes nicely onto the bat and its got a bit of bounce

6261313 its obvious but i just havent said it yet billy stull has had an outstanding camp
6261314 he was under pressure on debut especially against murali and mendis but he played them really well he took up the challenge and responsibility and showed some character
6261315 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours it was reversing and turning a bit and at one end we had a batsman badrinath but the other end was open
6261316 it was badrinaths first game and he had the pressure of scoring thats what gives you confidence and the more experience you get the better you dont need to play 100 games for that even 25 such games will give you much more experience the more you are in these conditions the more comfortable you will be in the future it is good preparation but it takes its toll too you need to really concentrate
6261317 well im losing some hair but it is a pleasure to go out there under pressure and perform
6261318 thats what youre supposed to do at this level people expect you to score and its a privilege a win is always good because the morale goes up and you start believing you can deal with pressure once youre square you can look into the opponents eyes and tell them that if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you
6261319 ive been playing for four years and ive seen him bowl like this he has moved way ahead when it comes to his fielding as well hes there more than 100 he bowled really well in england too and its really good to have someone like him
6261320 at times when a bowler doesnt get wickets people tend to say hes a weak bowler but it is about the effort put in you wont always have a good day unless you bowl in partnerships you wont get wickets if zaheer struck praveen kumars impact was also good he bowled really well with the new ball

6261414 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities

6261463 she doesnt think that making friends with dying old people so she can have access to their goods is a bad personality trait
6261464 she take her job very seriously very seriously whether or not she has any talent remains to be seen
6261465 its not the kind of comedy that talks down to people
6261466 we even had a good house on super bowl sunday
6261467 the opportunity to play four totally varied but interesting rich characters in one summer was great
6261468 its been a really fun summer to try on these different characters
6261469 i have tried to bring to her a likeability to her evil ness and her bitterness
6261470 shes an elitist ive tried to lend her a sort of justification in a way that you might actually like her
6261471 miss fozzard is judging other people for their foibles and is completely unaware of her own
6261472 it just never crosses her mind which is such a common human trait
6261473 i think i share a similar quality to her i feel the need to impress
6261474 i mean hell im an actress its fun to let loose a little within her world
6261475 i always love to be on this stage with these people
6261476 first we build a space mirror then if that doesnt work well fall back to the artificial volcano it may be a long shot but nothing else will save the american way of life
6261477 the second kiss is always tougher than the first one that first kiss its the passionate one its the one fueled by desire and attraction and all that but the second kiss is rational youve had time to think about it worry and overanalyze most women they prefer the first kiss but im partial to the second one because its about something more
6261478 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
6261479 the movie is set for release next year and its going to be a huge movie lionsgate recently announced that theyre putting a hundred million dollars into it
6261480 we have a very close relationship with the guys making the movie
6261481 i had lunch with the producer just the other day were talking to them all the time my system information
6261482 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6261483 ebay sellers have a thousand gripes about the company but what they all boil down to is youre taking us to the cleaners instead of trying to explain to pissed off sellers that they really shouldnt be so mad ebay should make them happy by providing the simplest most efficient and most cost effective selling solution in the galaxy
6261484 auction sellers have argued that ebay is favoring fixed price goods to their detriment neglecting the business that made ebay the e commerce giant it is today ebay executives have countered saying that ebay will always have auctions though it has to give buyers the ability to shop the way they want increasingly that means giving them the convenience of buying something for a set price
6261485 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6261486 there have been a couple of farms that have been prosecuted twice and there should be conditions put on their consents in order to preserve the environment
6261487 they may decide to penalise them financially or refuse to pick up their milk
6261488 we are ticking off all of these consents and some of these guys should have it as a condition
6261489 are just so upset with these so called ferocious attacks these have been benign even the britney spears paris hilton ad was funny it was benign
6261490 its you know its just its just we cant hit the girl i dont care how far feminisms saying you cant hit the girl and you cant you cant criticize the little black man child you just cant do it cause its just not right its not fair hes such a victim
6261491 nobody criticizes sen hillary clinton well you might say no michelle obama and mrs elizabeth edwards are out there criticizing her but see i finally figured this one out too you cant hit the girl you just you cant hit the girl
6261492 and for former democratic presidential candidate john edwards and obama to go out there and criticize hillary would she would she plays the victim better than anybody does and she could make real hay out of that so theyve got their wives out there ripping her
6261493 more striking however is the drop in obamas favorable rating obamas favorable rating has slid from 59 percent to 48 percent since june at the same time his negative rating has risen from 27 to 35 percent the bulk of that shift stems from republicans souring on obama amid ferocious attacks on the democrat by mccain and his allies
6261494 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6261495 while nlt has yet to provide us with a copy of the complaint it filed against us based on nlts press release today we believe that the allegations are frivolous and without merit biolase intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously and will explore asserting appropriate claims against nlt
6261496 we cannot guarantee the safety effectiveness or regulatory compliance of any used biolase laser sold or modified by third parties and we will continue to work hard to protect dentists and patients which is of the utmost importance to us
6261497 anything that will draw people to town thats really good for us
6261498 if the numbers add up then its going to be a good thing
6261499 otherwise people would park their cars and then wouldnt move its actually keeping traffic revolving
6261500 to guarantee a degree of turnover there would have to be some level of enforcement
6261501 i dont think they were too happy with what was landing on them
6261502 early primary election returns favor schmick district 9 representative appears likely to face pullman democrat in general election
6261503 i think its an affirmation that people are grateful for what i was able to accomplish for them
6261504 i dont think you can go through this and not be anxious but i was very pleased
6261505 everyone told me not to worry too much but i didnt want to discount any candidates so im very happy
6261506 my goal in the primary was to move on and i did
6261507 i think weve been running a really strong campaign and we want to continue doing what weve already been doing
6261508 the more doors we can knock on and the more personal contact with voters we have i think it will pay off in the end
6261509 it has been an honor to represent the people in the 9th district
6261510 im overwhelmed by how good the people are to work with and i will continue to work hard for them
6261511 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6261512 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6261513 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6261514 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6261515 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts

6261521 al manar ini adalah media perjuangan melawan penindasan israel dan hizbullah yang dikategorikan sebagai teroris oleh pemerintah as adalah para pejuang kemerdekaan sama dengan para pejuang kita dahulu yang dikategorikan ekstremis oleh penjajah belanda
6261522 saya juga mohon as tidak bias menilai bahwa islam sama dengan teroris
6261523 kita diharapkan berdemokrasi dan itu kita jalankan termasuk juga dalam hal keterbukaan informasi karenanya saya juga inginkan masyarakat kita mendapat informasi bukan secara sepihak dan bukan dari sumber terbatas

6261568 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6261569 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6261570 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6261571 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6261572 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6261573 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6261574 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6261575 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6261576 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6261591 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6261592 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6261593 weve had a lot of flooding in isolated neighborhoods people with anywhere from 6 inches to 4 feet 1 2 meters of water in their homes
6261594 weve had just under 1 000 homes impacted by the flooding weve had to rescue people in boats and airboats
6261595 were getting beat on and beat on and beat on its still over us
6261596 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6261597 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6261598 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6261599 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6261600 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6261601 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6261630 when we first proposed the cut in january we knew it was difficult but necessary we need to achieve these savings
6261631 it really is great news for those who provide health care but also for medi cal patients
6261632 its been very difficult for patients in a lot of communities to get the kind of care they need
6261633 it is hard to express how big a victory this is a lot of patients are going to the emergency room or to urgent care services when they could be better served if they had a regular health care provider
6261634 the current reimbursement was so substandard for them to reduce it by another 10 percent was appalling it would have created a crisis for the entire state
6261635 the transportation security administration says a laptop containing the sensitive personal information of 33 000 applicants to an airport security prescreening program has gone missing
6261636 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
6261637 this is a giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
6261638 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility
6261639 to be coerced to treat it as if it were a condition that is pathological is unjust
6261640 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience
6261641 is not abortion or contraception but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
6261642 an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions

6261687 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
6261688 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6261689 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down

6261691 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets
6261692 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6261693 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6261694 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets

6261710 shes a valuable animal because shes a female and they really support the manatee population
6261711 and because shes a youngster she likely has 40 years ahead of her to produce a lot of babies
6261712 at this point in time like i told you guys yesterday were going to have to be looking for guys that are maybe not having their best years and hopefully a change of scenery type of thing will help

6261715 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6261716 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6261717 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6261718 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6261719 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6261720 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6261721 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6261722 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6261723 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6261724 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6261725 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6261726 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6261727 new jersey doesnt have teams other than the devils so the jets and giants are new york new jersey teams anyway
6261728 if the jets win the super bowl the ticker tape parade will be down broadway anyway
6261729 is a very charitable organization it makes me feel good to work here
6261730 i would not have been able to go to college without it
6261731 im here because it feels good to do something good for others
6261732 most colleges and universities are looking for some type of community service that addresses a social need and is for a nonprofit organization
6261733 and we encourage them to focus their volunteer work on organizations close to home
6261734 true they have a goal but theyre also learning the importance of a strong work ethic acquiring job skills and building a solid reference volunteering teaches them the value of community service its a fun positive experience for them
6261735 we wouldnt be able to offer the programs we do without them
6261736 as mikes pastor i hear a lot about mike from his patients and peers in the profession who almost universally recognize him as an excellent clinician who knows his medical science inside and out
6261737 mike is also an excellent member of the temple terrace community and has worked diligently over the years to help people who lack resources obtain good medical care mike goes above and beyond the call of duty in serving the community and donating to local charities from his time and treasure
6261738 he has served on several multi county aids task forces on the chronic fatigue syndrome task force and on other volunteer humanitarian efforts
6261739 mel is a resolute champion and spokesperson for temple terrace
6261740 whether its as a keynote presenter at the league of cities working with other municipalities and counties around the state or when shes visiting with our legislators in tallahassee or washington d c all who meet mel know she is from temple terrace and she loves her city
6261741 others find her enthusiasm and passion for bettering our community and the lives of our citizens infectious
6261742 it is with great honor that i recommend barbara sparks mcglinchy for temple terrace citizen of the year
6261743 barbara has built a successful relationship between usf and the temple terrace chamber of commerce with her influence and dedicated spirit
6261744 she is simply a class act and very deserving of being named citizen of the year
6261745 city council members have been concerned about the lack of a volunteer policy since the lawsuit
6261746 we worked very closely with the human resources department with legal we looked at other cities
6261747 its not a fact and i have to deal with facts
6261748 i dont want to lurch ahead and use the totality of the reserve based on an estimate only
6261749 we have wait lists for services of tens of thousands of people with developmental disabilities people who need subsidized child care people who need substance abuse services
6261750 rather than do another 4 percent cut we need to be more surgical about where the cuts are
6261751 and i think it was very smart of them to do so
6261752 you dont want to scrape the bottom of the barrel that much
6261753 for a state that has a 66 billion budget 300 million in working capital is very very thin we wouldnt want to go there
6261754 i went through a divorce back then and as a middle age single person i decided to go for a condo because i was tired of yard work
6261755 for the last six months theres only been one or two for sale at a time but now theres six
6261756 i havent seen the housing slowdown affect us at all
6261757 we dont have much for rent and any units for sale appear to be selling
6261758 people who move here from other parts of the country expect them since theyre more commonplace
6261759 were just getting them so were a little behind the times
6261760 theyre doing especially well now since the housing market is making it harder to get a house
6261761 gas prices may be helping since people want to stay closer to where they work and shop
6261762 this is about their living standards and their quality of life that is a city issue
6261763 were here to make sure everyone is happy and theres no wrongdoing
6261764 some of the things said monday we did not know about
6261765 i cant do anything if i dont know about it
6261766 theres problems here but people are too scared to talk about them
6261767 sure there are problems here but there are problems everywhere
6261768 its a bargain here it really is were safe theres nothing going on here
6261769 we have tried to maintain all of our buildings with less and less money
6261770 chris has been the driving force behind the change that the business has undergone over the last year
6261771 the promotion is well deserved and will enable him to do even more to improve the business the way we service our fans the impact we can have on amateur hockey on long island the leadership we show in the community and more
6261772 i know chris well enough that he will stop at nothing less in making the islanders the model franchise in the nhl
6261773 doesnt want to built the venue in a neighborhood that doesnt want him there
6261774 it wasnt a terrorist trying to fly a plane into plum island its actually terrorists looking to develop the very pathogens that the nbaf is trying to defeat this is actually a justification of the nbaf we need counter measures we need vaccines
6261775 we wanted to win but it was a good workout we worked hard for each other i was able to blood a number of new players northern ireland were always going to make it difficult for us we lacked a cutting edge up front but were unfortunate not to score

6261781 the 65 year old local gadfly has stymied cycling support efforts here by arguing that urban bicycle boosting could actually be bad for the environment
6261782 there are a tremendous number of first time voters who will be crucial in this election and youth vote 08 will provide direct insight into the issues they are facing along with their mindset
6261783 pollsters are saying the youth vote will decide this election
6261784 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6261785 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6261786 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet
6261787 i rarely watch myself on highlights but tonight i may have to
6261788 doing a great job conscientious hard working intelligent the best
6261789 things just got a little more interesting and i now have a different view of you
6261790 mike you dont come to las vegas and talk to a man like moe green like that
6261791 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
6261792 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball he will have his touches
6261793 he has a gift god blesses everybody with some kind of ability but everything he does is effortless
6261794 i can see how were similar but i havent proved myself this is still like a rookie season to me i cant be put in the same sentence as a guy like that hopefully i can one day i take it as a compliment but i think its a little bit of a stretch right now
6261795 i definitely feel a lot faster than last year i think im a lot stronger in my legs my expectation is to be on every part of the field just being a versatile back
6261796 those other guys are going to spell best at some point hes not going to play the whole game
6261797 little less conversation the theme for the us broadcasts of las vegas
6261798 you cant be a quitter when youre caught up in the glitter of the night life
6261799 fomos melhores no segundo tempo tivemos chances claras de gols mas infelizmente n o conseguimos marcar o importante que a defesa conseguiu se segurar bem e n s n o levamos nenhum gol
6261800 conversamos muito antes do jogo sobre as nossas partidas fora de casa e percebemos que n o pod amos mais deixar de ganhar pontos viemos para c com o objetivo de conquistar pelo menos um ponto e conseguimos
6261801 conseguimos um bom resultado aqui em salvador mas j temos que pensar no pr ximo jogo vamos em busca de mais tr s pontos l no rio de janeiro para voltar com uma boa bagagem para o recife
6261802 n s criamos muito mais e chegamos v rias vezes ao gol deles mas faltou tranq ilidade na hora de concluir n o tivemos efici ncia
6261803 precisava apostar na dupla de jogadores mais descansados que eu tenho o alo sio e o borges j jogaram juntos e t m condi es muito boas o campeonato muito desgastante e eu tenho de preservar meus atletas
6261804 eu estava com a bola e o cara chegou dando uma rasteira minha caneleira at saiu do lugar e veio para cima se foi falta ou n o eu n o posso dizer e acho que s as c meras podem mostrar mas foi um lance muito duro
6261805 faltou caprichar um pouco mais n s perdemos muitas bolas e demos espa o para o atl tico pr jogar no meio faltou pegada mas o problema maior foi errar tantos passes
6261806 n s melhoramos um pouco a sa da de bola e tivemos mais tranq ilidade conseguimos ganhar espa o no campo e tivemos mais volume no segundo tempo
6261807 its a little different but the approach is the same
6261808 im just ready for the games to count i kind of wish i could play the whole game but i understand
6261809 i looked at it as him complementing what we have
6261810 i dont know but i think they must be leaning toward it
6261811 i would hope theres a reason i didnt go and that its because they want me to be here
6261812 alans been very consistent and his ability to pitch nearly every day has been invaluable in times when our bullpen has been overworked as a group but we wont make those types of contractual decisions until after the season
6261813 granted theyve changed gears in the direction theyre going but i think i can still help them on the field and off the field i havent had the greatest season but im healthy and my arm is still good and over the course of my career if ive had a bad year dont bet against me the next season
6261814 that was a good spot for me to come into and have success
6261815 the biggest thing was location i threw almost every pitch right where i wanted to it was a real good feeling
6261816 i think the stuff we do in between starts has allowed him to get to this point and his arm is feeling good
6261817 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent

6261820 the movies music software and literary works that are the fruit of american creative genius
6261821 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
6261822 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
6261823 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence
6261824 but its going to be much much harder to turn things around at this point
6261825 the progress of iraq including security and the successful policies achieved by the iraqi government for national unity
6261826 we welcome all lebanese and investors in a safe environment and we will provide lebanon with iraqi oil according to our agreements
6261827 we also agreed on forming a joint iraqi lebanese group which will put the final touches on the joint cooperation and reforming the failure that has occurred between arab countries
6261828 the message that i want to send and work out is that arab countries have passed through many experiences and difficulties for a long time and now we should take the lessons from them
6261829 we should move beyond the troubles that happened due to the roles played by the occupiers and some parties or people and israel which played a role in the troubles we have faced
6261830 i felt from prime minister maliki that there is real readiness to give lebanon special treatment in oil prices and also study all the details about how lebanon could collaborate with iraq in the field of oil
6261831 i have one race to go i have to refocus again to get one more gold medal
6261832 i dont want to say anything too serious because my coach might want me to run 400 meters
6261833 anything is possible if i put my mind to it im not worried about that now dont hold your breath i dont think ill be going up to the 400 any time soon
6261834 the 200 has been my love since i was 15
6261835 i was the youngest ever to win world juniors it means a lot to me its dear to my heart the 200 means more to me than the 100
6261836 i wont compare myself to michael phelps to win eight gold medals thats great im on the track and hes in the water you cant compare the two
6261837 theres nothing on the roads before the race was run
6261838 he ran 52 flat for the 400 on a grass track
6261839 i got up at 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious i didnt want to go to the cafeteria i went straight to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6261840 i thought he robbed us of another great performance in the 100 because i thought he could run 9 50
6261841 im so pleased i thought if he runs if he truly runs this is his olympic games its magical none of us thought world record i thought 19 55 19 52
6261842 i assume his first 100 had to be faster than michael
6261843 a 6 5 sprinter with cat like feet and the turnover to match the smaller guys if he has the same tempo and takes nine foot strides its ridiculous you just cant match it
6261844 hes bad he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record
6261845 im serious hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6261846 those guys are always together you never see one without the other two
6261847 i remember vic adamle former gophers assistant coach pulling me over to ask me if i thought my brother would be able to compete
6261848 i said all i know is that when we had practice in high school nick was the last guy i ever wanted to go up against
6261849 when you come in as a walk on and see all these division i athletes you dont know where to put yourself on that scale
6261850 obviously watching it on tv youre like wow these guys are really good but once you get in you feel your way around and realize you can play its kind of like a learning process
6261851 you move into a small town and new kids dont get the same chances
6261852 you find out there are certain names in town and those are the guys that are deemed the starters nick and i got there early enough to work our way into the system
6261853 hes an exotic animal lover said the boys father duane tow a legendary high school running back at jackson minn
6261854 hes been to japan a couple times anything unique he drifts toward hes raising koi a variety of carp in his basement now and has several other critters
6261855 o jesus we utter your name with every breath we take you are our only way through this life amen

6261857 these three elephants john tonky and wanly are now resting peacefully under this monument
6261858 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6261859 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6261860 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6261861 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs
6261862 she wants them to be friends jodie realizes that if cydney perceives them to be one big happy family shed never sue for half her assets

6261881 you will grow to love him the love will come
6261882 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6261883 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt thinks it matters whether american wins or loses
6261884 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job against the taliban
6261885 senator mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6261886 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses

6262123 lawmakers are showing a slight restraint in writing the earmarks in the fy 2009 spending bills according to an analysis by taxpayers for common sense tcs the house has increased the number and value of earmarks at about the same rate the senate has cut earmarks by 16 in the spending bills in terms of total dollars the analysis is based on all the bills that have passed full committee and are awaiting action in both chambers

6262167 we seem to have forgotten about art buyers in this equation consumer awareness and informed buying of aboriginal art is the critical act that can rebalance the exchange between artist and consumer
6262168 importantly the benefits are for the art buyer as much as for the artist in buying from an art centre consumers are accessing work of the highest integrity and quality
6262169 let me make this very clear art centres are powerful examples of aboriginal owned enterprises the artists are in charge of their own destiny how their art is sold and where and what they paint
6262170 aboriginal owned and governed art centres are incorporated under federal or state legislation and meet the highest standards of transparency and accountability
6262171 there has been significant coverage regarding the importance of the provenance of artworks in terms of resale value in the secondary market
6262172 galleries know that art centre works represent quality integrity authenticity and strong provenance they also know the works of art that they display and sell to their clients reflect their own business image and ethics

6262174 art centres have worked for three decades and will carry on doing so in remote communities they continue to show why artistically and economically they are so important and bring considerable benefits to an artist their family and their wider community
6262175 art centres employ a whitefella manager to help them negotiate the whitefella world but the business is owned by the artists and it is they who employ the manager decisions are made by the artists themselves
6262176 in working with artists everyday i have seen firsthand how profound the benefits of an aboriginal owned and managed business in remote communities actually is
6262177 the anangu pitjantjatjara lands are home to australias oldest aboriginal art centre ernabella celebrates its 60th birthday this year and some of the youngest
6262178 in communities on the anangu pitjantjatjara lands art centres act as functional community centres providing a range of socio cultural services in addition to fostering artists professional development
6262179 one of the key characteristics of art centres is that they work with artists to identify support and develop young and emerging artists

6262187 oh no she died in a concentration camp im pretty sure they all did im not sure how the movie ends but thats what really happened
6262188 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6262189 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6262190 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6262191 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6262192 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere

6262201 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
6262202 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
6262203 back in the day amateur boxing was on tv every weekend in the states
6262204 when you have a good amateur programme it helps develop well rounded boxers look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles

6262225 pretty much everyone knows that growing up in a household where the dad is a professional baseball player the last thing you talk about is baseball
6262226 so you understand history but you dont dwell on it because the father and son relationship is more important than the numbers
6262227 i dont really worry about that everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen
6262228 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
6262229 we need to send a strong message of alarm and urgency to highlight the seriousness of the matter

6262234 they kept their information close and they didnt share it
6262235 mr khadr is alleged to be an arms supplier for al qaeda
6262236 i am hard pressed to be think of a more serious set of offences
6262237 mr khadr is alleged to have supplied weapons to a notorious and ruthless terrorist organization with a proven record of killing innocent individuals on a massive scale
6262238 expressed admiration for the members of al qaeda who carried out the unspeakable 9 11 attacks in the united states
6262239 i accept that over the years there may have been persons involved in questionable activities with questionable associations who have passed through the centre from time to time
6262240 it is our belief that she has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing
6262241 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6262242 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6262243 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism

6262252 as previously advised the group 2008 npat is not expected to be above the 2007 group npat of 643 million
6262253 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
6262254 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6262255 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down
6262256 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6262257 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets
6262258 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6262259 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6262260 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets
6262261 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6262262 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6262263 as a matter of prudence no dividend will be paid until sufficient progress has been made on corporate debt reduction
6262264 everyone at babcock amp brown thanks phil for his enormous contribution to development and success of babcock amp brown over so many years
6262265 jim babcock is to be congratulated for his vision and insight that has created global company with a unique and mutually respectful culture and a strong focus on performance
6262266 i have every confidence in michael larkin and the team in place to execute on the changes that have been announced today to ensure that we leverage the strong platforms and skill sets we have to continue babcock amp browns evolution towards a global alternative asset management business

6262280 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced
6262281 i will let no one question my love of this country
6262282 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced

6262285 scott adapted a book i wrote into a presentation he did a fantastic job he took subject matter that some might call boring and made it fresh and exciting he is an expert at visual storytelling and i recommend him highly
6262286 working with scott was a great experience his creative thinking and customer service skills are unparalleled he managed to understand the essence of what i was trying to communicate and provide an outstanding presentation in a very tight time schedule i wont hesitate to work with him once again if the opportunity arises and i obviously recommend ethos3 for any presentation need
6262287 we love each other like the night sky loves the moon like the sun loves the sea like super mario loves mushrooms
6262288 love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
6262289 when your hearts on fire you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
6262290 love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction
6262291 i like you so much i care about you you give me a boner
6262292 tutte le persone in questa magione avevano un motivo per uccidere la contessa
6262293 so bene cosa vuol dire signorina ma non so cosa vuol dire bene
6262294 immaginate di essere un cammello che digita una pulsantiera per questo che anche lei tra i sospetti signor mufflentai
6262295 e la signora swassletainzer non potrebbe essere stata lei visto che la contessa le arrotolave le castagne senza che lei ne prendesse il merito
6262296 e lei sig ra frischel con la sua mania di far parlare i comodini con il ventriloquismo assai
6262297 the photo is of two old abandoned boats at the old pier in salen
6262298 i thought the peaceful water clouds and light made a lovely shot
6262299 why hasnt this beautiful woman hooked up with a man and gotten married and been cared for
6262300 new research shows that american women are having fewer children than ever before and more women are reaching 40 without becoming mothers
6262301 i was kept in a cell for two days they kept telling me i should quit working in the media
6262302 if news directors or editors write something critical of the government they will be sure to get a call from a government official
6262303 i saw police beating protesters in an anti us demonstration
6262304 when i tried to take pictures i was sent to the attorney generals office and he arrested me he eventually released me and ordered me not to write the story
6262305 eighty to 90 percent of newspapers are supported by ex mujahideen commanders and other strongmen who are very politically minded
6262306 if the news director writes something these politicians dont like he will lose his job
6262307 there are some circles in the government that would like to restrict media freedoms but also some journalists who violate the principles of their profession
6262308 of course it would be best if journalists werent arrested but they shouldnt overstep their bounds either
6262309 the media does not reflect the achievements of the government
6262310 although the media law guarantees freedom of press the national interests of the country should be a priority over anything else
6262311 the government stance towards media is much different than last year because it has grown weaker and lost support as it grows weaker it will feel the need to lash out against critical press coverage
6262312 my family called me and told me that some mysterious armed men were lurking outside my house
6262313 im under risk and i cant continue airing my program there are a lot of powerful interests against me if this is how they treat the media i want to leave afghanistan and not come back
6262314 we started them because we had friends who were big fans of frosting but not necessarily cake
6262315 we started doing frosting shooters with friends and then we put it on the menu for 75 cents who doesnt love frosting
6262316 its kind of the cut to the chase evolution of cupcakes
6262317 i can imagine it being at parties its a great thing to have at an office party it provides just a little bite of sweetness and yumminess without going whole hog
6262318 we have a lot of regulars who know which flavors we offer on what day and theyll come in on saturdays because they know thats the day we have raspberry buttercream
6262319 i see fingers getting involved but theres no shame we dont judge here at sprinkles
6262320 you order the cupcake but you really want the frosting
6262321 it brings you back to when you used to lick the container or whatever your mom made it in
6262322 this is like a classic food trend a lot of people are thinking of the same thing at the same time which is really how most food things start
6262323 were not talking molecular gastronomy its kind of reducing down to the basic element of what a cupcake is
6262324 it really became a big thing i tried to stop offering them
6262325 but i would see people on the street and theyd be like where are the frosting shots they would get on my case about that
6262326 the people who will suffer the most will be the outpatients who usually travel by ambulance from their home to the hospital
6262327 eighty per cent of our work there is to ferry patients to and from the hospital
6262328 they are doing their best to provide an emergency service
6262329 but with the limited number of vehicles available it is a difficult job
6262330 the position changes during the day but i would say the worst affected are the outpatients
6262331 i was determined to have the photos we wanted and deserved
6262332 wed like to thank everyone who has been a big help
6262333 passion will make you go crazy but what other way is there to live
6262334 its not about how big the dog is in the fight its how big the fight is in the dog
6262335 it kind of looks like a pterodactyl from the gay jurassic park
6262336 yes i tried to call and they wouldnt let me speak with anyone
6262337 all you had to do is call and leave a message
6262338 this is a huge milestone another milestone in the life of uss freedom
6262339 it was a mere 64 months ago that freedom was a proposal on a piece of paper and here we are announcing the date for its commissioning

6262346 not only is this not the slam dunk that is being projected you probably have a better chance of hitting a blindfolded shot from mid court than coskata has of producing cost competitive ethanol
6262347 yes gasification plants are expensive to put on the ground
6262348 but the production cost is half that of gasoline and you also have more feedstock flexibility you can gasify trash tires agricultural residues wood waste any kind of biomass
6262349 the capital costs would have to go down by a factor of 100 before they could even start to get competitive
6262350 it is very expensive to do commercial demonstrations any facility producing under 1 to 2 million gallons per year is going to be unbelievably inefficient
6262351 you can never do your economics off of a demonstration
6262352 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
6262353 what struck me was that so many young people thought of growing old abroad

6262355 nascars selection of iowa speedway as a site for a nationwide race next year in only our third full year of competitive racing is an honor and a privilege

6262361 just close your eyes at any time of the day relax the body and you will feel that the dreaming is there it never disappears it is only suppressed by our daily activities it is like the stars in the day in the night you see the stars in the day you cannot see them but they are there always they are simply suppressed by the sunlight the same is true with dreaming in sleep you can feel dreams easily because the activity of the day is no more there thus that inner activity can be seen and felt when you get up in the morning the dreaming continues inside while you start acting on the outside if dreaming continues you cannot be said to be really awake in the night you are more asleep in the day you are less asleep the difference is relative because if the dreaming is there you cannot be said to be really awake dreaming creates a film over the consciousness this film becomes like a smoke you are surrounded by it you can only be said to be awake when there is no dreaming at all you awake when there is no dream inside you move there but there is no dream it is as if there were no star in the sky it has become pure space when there is no dreaming you become pure space and this purity innocence nondreaming consciousness is what is known as enlightenment the awakening

6262374 the dakotas high wind energy potential and low population means that wind power will be available to transmit to the rest of the midwest
6262375 tatanka represents another major step toward accionas goal of reducing the worlds co2 emissions by 220 million tons in the next 23 years

6262398 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6262399 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6262400 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6262401 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6262402 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6262403 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6262404 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6262405 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6262406 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6262407 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6262408 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6262409 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6262410 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6262411 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6262412 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6262413 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6262414 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6262415 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6262416 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6262417 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6262418 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6262419 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6262420 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6262421 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6262422 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6262423 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6262424 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6262425 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6262426 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6262427 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6262428 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6262429 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6262430 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6262431 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6262432 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6262433 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6262434 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6262435 it was a tough decision but this is something that i have always wanted to do
6262436 at quan sports marketing we will work with various teams on a wide range of duties and eventually focus on a core business that will help athletes with their charitable events and foundations
6262437 i love the aeros and to say that leaving is sad would be a huge understatement
6262438 probably the single biggest accomplishment i can think of while working with the aeros is the privilege of working with the best staff in the ahl
6262439 over the last five years we developed a great sales and working culture here and we passed that along to the fans that really make the aeros what they are today
6262440 now i will get the chance to be my own boss
6262441 im very excited and scared all at the same time
6262442 we are pleased to welcome jan l ng to ahlstrom his extensive experience and excellent leadership capabilities in global organizations coupled with his strong profitability focus make him an excellent addition to ahlstroms team
6262443 during the past months risto anttonen has skillfully led the company towards performance improvement in a challenging business environment and kept the momentum in the implementation of ahlstroms growth strategy

6262456 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6262457 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6262458 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6262459 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6262460 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6262461 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6262462 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6262463 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6262464 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6262465 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6262466 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6262467 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6262468 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6262469 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6262470 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6262471 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6262472 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6262473 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6262474 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6262475 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6262476 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6262477 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6262478 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6262479 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6262480 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6262481 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6262482 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6262483 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6262484 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6262485 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6262486 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6262487 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6262488 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6262489 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6262490 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6262491 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6262492 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6262493 who are open to doing something on the production side
6262494 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6262495 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6262496 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6262497 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6262498 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6262499 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6262500 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6262501 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6262502 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6262503 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

6262511 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6262512 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6262513 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6262514 guilty as hell free as a bird america is a great country

6262522 science pedagogy framed around social justice concerns can become a medium to transform individuals schools communities the environment and science itself in ways that promote equity and social justice creating a science education that is transformative implies not only how science is a political activity but also the ways in which students might see and use science and science education in ways transformative of the institutional and interpersonal power structures that play a role in their lives

6262526 the majority of them said yes and i asked them if any of those players were still active they all said that ken griffey jr was the only active player from the episode
6262527 i told them that i took care of that already and spoke with cincinnatis training staff i asked about griffey jr s main health concern giantism the trainers said there is nothing to worry about i also asked if ken has grew past the nerve tonic addiction the trainers looked at each other and than confirmed after a few facial gestures
6262528 thats all i wanted to really know about ken and after that meeting i knew he would be on the white sox

6262560 we gave them too much space and allowed them to pick us apart and keep the ball when they shouldnt have in the second half i think our kids really stepped up and tried to show that we were the better team
6262561 we have to stop giving up such clear cut chances by our opponents
6262562 and we have got to shore ourselves up on the defensive end we just have to continue working and its tough when you have 13 newcomers on a 22 man roster it is going to take some time for us to gel get on the same page connect and create chances going forward but we are going to keep training and keep working and hopefully the goals will come

6262610 a lot of buyers didnt really believe there was a threat
6262611 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6262612 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help
6262613 in order to ensure smooth traffic flow a nice environment and good social order we will invite these participants to hold their demonstrations in designated places
6262614 for chinese petitioners if their protest applications were approved it would lead to a chain reaction of others seeking to voice their problems as well
6262615 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6262616 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6262617 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6262618 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6262619 i think were going to have do something theres no doubt about it but what exactly were going to do were not sure yet were going to wait for all the information to come in
6262620 i think what needs to be reviewed is whether you should have an agency overseeing these really important functions
6262621 the governments accountable were accountable for our zoning review and i think its important when youre regulating public safety that it be done through a legislative authority
6262622 what im saying is that something happened which obviously should not have happened
6262623 lets figure out exactly what went wrong before we act precipitously
6262624 to send the same people out to review their own work is like asking imelda marcos to count her own shoes
6262625 i think we need to have some kind of independent person along with the tssa people to make sure this time that the inspections are being done properly and people can rely on public safety being placed first
6262626 if there is a risk that we think could cause a compromise with the safety of the public i think that we need to take action and i expect them to take actions
6262627 if the guys in the kiosk he has to run across the yard to the dock to shut it down if theres an accident
6262628 he wont make it in time ill guarantee you that propane explodes very fast
6262629 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6262630 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6262631 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6262632 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6262633 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6262634 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6262635 you should youve stank you wear them every day mud coloured bogies
6262636 we are providing banks lots of cash to carry them through while they have these bad loans on their books but yet they are not required to change their business models
6262637 it was difficult to judge initially just how problematic things would become
6262638 nobody dreamed back a year ago bear stearns would have fallen and fannie and freddie would be under threat right now
6262639 is a little bit concerned now that maybe the fed is going to overstay its welcome and almost become japan like in not allowing the natural course of some of these problems to take effect the natural course is for more banks to fail
6262640 we began sponsoring the north korean olympic team last year as north korea is an old friend of china
6262641 its a good opportunity for us as we want to become an international specialist sports brand we need to experience major events like the olympics
6262642 maybe it is different in the west but we have had no negative feedback from customers in china
6262643 its very rare that chinese customers comment on political matters so nobody would protest about our sponsorship
6262644 i felt a bit disappointed they did not wear our clothes at the opening ceremony
6262645 but many other countries also didnt wear their sponsors clothes
6262646 we want to participate in the olympics show our athletic spirit and spread our reputation in china and the rest of the world
6262647 chinese people know it is very chaotic there and they sympathize with the iraqis it is a country at war and even managing to attend the games will be an encouragement for them
6262648 we sponsor the sudanese track and field team we do not sponsor the sudanese government
6262649 we found the team through an american agent as we were looking for a good african team for our running products we never put politics human rights and sports together we are a sports company not a government body
6262650 we sponsor the clothes the belarus athletes will wear at medal ceremonies
6262651 industry today is a significantly different one than that which gave us pause last march
6262652 the potential magnitude of the fuel induced cash burn capital and liquidity options and who might disappear and when
6262653 assessing who might first return to annual profitability and when
6262654 but people need to realize that these big airlines have big resources
6262655 they have horrible income statements and balance sheets but they have what i call inertia
6262656 airlines also can pull all these hidden assets out of every little nook and cranny and sell them to keep going
6262657 small carriers may not be able to do that but these really big airlines have tremendous underestimated staying ability
6262658 people talk about bankruptcy and liquidation but they dont understand how deep these big airlines resources really are
6262659 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6262660 one can only assume at this time that this was due to mechanical failure
6262661 it crashed close to the airport and broke into two pieces
6262662 i use to be able to come to you for anything and everything but i cant anymore i dont want to try to get close because i dont think thats possible again
6262663 i will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go i will counsel you and watch over you
6262664 as sean tomados en cuenta porque esa participaci n abre espacios
6262665 los pol ticos tienen que contar con el voto dominicano pues en elecciones futuras hay una posibilidad de que esa poblaci n crezca
6262666 no se puede ser indiferente a los problemas de puerto rico si vivimos aqu y puerto rico nos abri los brazos tenemos que entender que los problemas de puerto rico son de nosotros tambi n
6262667 cuando se trata de otras nacionalidades no se cuestiona su inter s en la pol tica local pero por racismo y xenofobia se cuestiona al dominicano
6262668 my child may be at hempfest but at least i am with them
6262669 people just yelled randomly all i could hear were shouts of go china from all directions throughout
6262670 i shouted with the crowd right from the first minute to the end of the first half part but was so worn out in the second half that i decided to sit and watch rather than cheer our athletes
6262671 chinese soccer fans know how to do the wave and cheer their hearts out
6262672 despite being on the margin of the of the olympic mountains the city has a reputation for frequent rain this reputation derives from this frequency of precipitation as well as the fact that it is cloudy an average of 226 days per year cf 132 in new york city eastern seaboard of the united states seattle was also not listed in a study that revealed the 10 rainiest cities in the continental united states most of the precipitation falls as drizzle or light rain with only occasional downpours
6262673 but it gets a lot of play on fox news
6262674 will run negative ad after negative ad attack after attack with the goal of making you lose focus on the issues and focus on me and try to make me out to be a risky scary guy
6262675 now i must say i dont find myself particularly scary or particularly risky
6262676 las intenciones de crear y mantener un r gimen dictatorial son del fsln
6262677 no desire to see your real life suffer as a consequence of playing dont forget your friends your family your school or your work
6262678 will prevent release of 104 million tons of co2 over the first 14 years
6262679 if the state allows the mining to proceed after the whole nation knows what mtr will do to the wind potential then theyre going to look really bad
6262680 and mtr is going to be viewed in a whole new light as destroying the resources that renewable energy and alternative economic development could be based on
6262681 in a very old very destructive and very dirty way
6262682 if the nations going to be really serious about moving toward clean energy
6262683 it could really show its commitment to that by preserving coal river mountain through wind power
6262684 if you can build a wind farm in the middle of the appalachian coalfields on a mountain slated for mountaintop removal it would be a powerful statement toward making people part of the alternative energy economy
6262685 their existence doesnt depend on litigation or boom and bust cycles

6262688 saya melakukan perjalanan karena saya suka berpindah dari satu tempat ke tempat lain saya menikmati kebebasan yang didapat dari perjalanan menyenangkan rasanya untuk terlepas dari ikatan tanggung jawab tugas saya suka hal hal yang tidak saya ketahui saya bertemu orang orang aneh yang menghibur sejenak dan kadang kadang menyarankan sebuah tema untuk tulisan saya sering lelah dengan diri saya sendiri dan saya merasa dengan melakukan perjalanan saya bisa menambah sesuatu pada kepribadian dan karena itu mengubah sedikit diri saya
6262689 i would like to think im close to getting a game but we will just have to wait and see what happens
6262690 i have been mainly playing in the defence since i came over here but i was actually tried out on the wing last weekend and i really enjoyed it
6262691 est adoptando esas decisiones no porque no ame a estados unidos sino porque cree que no tiene importancia si estados unidos gana o pierde
6262692 no that shadow is not a monster monsters do not exist and even if they did they would not sneak into your house they would break in you would have heard it then too it would be moving it would have attacked you by now and why would it be standing in your living room monsters have better things to do like be in movies

6262696 an in depth inquiry to avoid such accidents in the future said ms alvarez
6262697 as previously advised the group 2008 npat is not expected to be above the 2007 group npat of 643 million it said
6262698 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6262699 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6262700 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6262701 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6262702 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6262703 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6262704 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6262705 ninety four per cent are in favour of their new eba australian licensed aircraft engineers association secretary steve purvinas said today
6262706 our conversations have focussed on outreach assistance and opportunities to help educate students on alchohol consumption i dont think lowering the age would make a difference
6262707 the petition calls for dealing with personal responsibility in 18 through 20 year olds were in favor of it a discussion as long as its based on scientific research not stories and emotions
6262708 we received the petition were not signing it but recognize their initiative is raising an important issue that when freshman arrive they already have a pattern of drinking till they pass out
6262709 your ad on craigslist was a breath of fresh air im glad there are a few ladies out there like yourself i work in the greater greenville area im a pharmaceutical bio tech sales rep so im all over the area im a widowed young professional with a wonderful 4 year old daughter who is the center of my world if that is a big issue then let me know b c were definitely not the right fit i would like to have another child at some point but thats looking ahead too far i suppose i hope the pics i sent are acceptable i dont have any of just me so you can see my daughter in a couple of them and my mom and daughter in the snow mobile pick from montana that was in march the jungle cave looking pic was from puerto rico last november and the other is just a moving van pic from a few months ago i havent downloaded the latest trip from maine new hampshire that we all went on mom daughter and i at the beginning of the month i was going to send one of me posing with george w bush
6262710 matched the dna profile obtained from the bloodstain of jason young
6262711 he is doing what hes been told to do and that is all you need to know
6262712 we are not aware of any australians involved in the incident however our embassy in madrid is in contact with local authorities hospitals and the airline to ascertain if any australians are affected a dfat spokeswoman said
6262713 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6262714 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown
6262715 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6262716 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6262717 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6262718 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6262719 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs joness medical condition declined
6262720 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6262721 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6262722 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6262723 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6262724 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6262725 that is the reason why we are looking at the buyback and why so much of it is geared towards the northern end of the system
6262726 he must have decided its more important to get a speedy trial than to have all those days free to campaign
6262727 we want the verdict as far on this side of election day as possible
6262728 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6262729 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6262730 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6262731 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6262732 i think he knows how to reach across party lines the same way barack obama does
6262733 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6262734 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6262735 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6262736 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6262737 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6262738 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6262739 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6262740 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6262741 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6262742 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6262743 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6262744 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6262745 since the apple soho store moved in six years ago it has become the worst neighbour in soho
6262746 no bar nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like apple soho has
6262747 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6262748 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6262749 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6262750 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment
6262751 apple employees during their breaks lounging eating smoking littering in effect trespassing on nearby peoples stoops
6262752 residents and businesses of soho desperately need your help regarding constant problems we have with apple soho
6262753 we shouldnt have sent these young men to go and get killed
6262754 whats certain is that they died in an ambush like game animals
6262755 but there also has to be a time for reflection on the sense of our presence in afghanistan
6262756 the priority should first be reconstruction rebuilding afghanistan and above all training the afghan army
6262757 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6262758 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6262759 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6262760 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6262761 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6262762 measures to be considered include the suspension of particular governments from the forum
6262763 they have also signalled that they will not let the issue drop
6262764 they did accept undertakings in good faith that there is no technical administrative or managerial reason why elections cant be held by the end of march next year only political will is lacking
6262765 it is a very strong message and the ball now is really in his bainimaramas court as to how he reacts this is very much about the pacific islands forum leaders assuming leadership of this issue the united nations looks to us to lead the commonwealth works closely with us
6262766 in practical terms i dont think there is any prospect of fiji restoring its relations with its very important donors if it goes down a road of refusing to engage with the forum around the proper timetable fiji has already greatly undermined its economy the living standards of its people
6262767 not to engage with the forum now not to engage properly with the commonwealth through dialogue process is simply to postpone by who knows how long fiji trying to rebuild its economy and living standards
6262768 if you go to archives for example and wish to get some information you were charged a fee and some fee is reasonable but the pressure on those agencies is to increase those fees
6262769 and the war memorial presumably will be under some sort of pressure to charge fees for additional services
6262770 but to be perfectly honest weve had this arrangement efficiency dividends now for over 20 years
6262771 it has got increasingly tighter for no good logical reason other than a revenue raiser
6262772 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6262773 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6262774 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6262775 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6262776 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6262777 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6262778 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6262779 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6262780 letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6262781 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6262782 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6262783 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6262784 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist
6262785 we want to make sure that students are mastering the content of their classes and not just failing busy work

6262814 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6262815 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6262816 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested

6262843 the last time i played the u s open normal was back in 2001 when i got to the semi finals probably it was so long ago

6262866 when they separated the dolphins were never again able to return and reproduce
6262867 thus isolated the bolivian river dolphin inia boliviensis eventually developed
6262868 after being split up they accumulated mutations and formed a new species
6262869 so if fish are affected theyre the first to feel the effects
6262870 the dolphins are a reflection of the entire aquatic system
6262871 the amazon river dolphin could compete against the bolivian river dolphin for food and perhaps bring about its extinction

6262877 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention

6262879 common ground how to stop the partisan war that is destroying america
6262880 theyre pretty much the same as far as i can see

6262882 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while
6262883 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical treatment later on
6262884 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6262885 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6262886 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6262887 there are drugs on the market for oa therapy but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6262888 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6262889 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
6262890 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6262891 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6262892 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6262893 go around the world and say this is the way its got to be
6262894 one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly american
6262895 send troops to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide in nations outside our strategic interest
6262896 with a return to normal times again become a normal nation
6262897 to acknowledge that our greatest challenge is now behind us
6262898 good that americans know what it is like to be vulnerable
6262899 see more and more of the very kind of threat iraq poses now a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed
6262900 sooner or later this guy has to be taken out the message has to be sent because if it isnt sent now it empowers every would be saddam out there and every would be terrorist out there
6262901 the future of iraq will affect the way in which the middle east and the arab world in particular evolve in the next decade and beyond
6262902 op ed regulars at the new york times and the washington post the editors of the new yorker the new republic and slate columnists in time and newsweek

6262906 if you are making 150 000 a year or less as a family then youre middle class or you may be poor
6262907 but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free i believe it is irresponsible intergenerationally for us to invest or for us to spend 10 billion a month on a war and not have a way of paying for it that i think is unacceptable under the approach im taking if you make 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut if youre making 250 000 a year or more youre going to see a modest increase
6262908 i dont want to take any money from the rich

6262911 not long ago in baghdad al qaida took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is and were going to defeat this evil and the central battleground according to david petraeus and osama bin laden is baghdad mosul basra and iraq and we are winning and we are succeeding and our troops will come home with honor and with victory and not in defeat

6262913 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

6263073 these elections if what happened in the skies free and fair elections are far from tampering the official features of the new legislative session borne by the project and sectarian affiliations and allow the forces of the marginalized to enter you
6263074 over the last decade many of our referral sources have become our competitors
6263075 take the work to the general practice firms they are familiar with
6263076 intellectual property has become just another area of federal practice
6263077 there are plenty of smaller companies that want to use smaller law firms for patent litigation
6263078 it really comes down to what kind of attention you want your law firm to give you and since were not a microsoft attention is critical
6263079 but cost is also a major factor behind choosing a boutique
6263080 general practice firms overstaff cases something boutiques just dont do
6263081 but i find there is more flexibility on staffing and pricing arrangements at boutiques
6263082 its great when youre as knowledgeable about the science and technology behind a patent as the other sides expert witnesses
6263083 when lawyers understand the technology its more efficient less time needed from our engineers and lower fees for us
6263084 its hard for a general practice firm to make patent prosecution profitable
6263085 a patent prosecution practice requires a whole different docketing system and financial management system and large firms often have a hard time implementing the systems needed
6263086 it is the poorly prosecuted patents that have problems and end up in litigation
6263087 has allowed us to differentiate ourselves from general practice firms
6263088 a boutique that handles a clients patent prosecution becomes steeped in knowledge of the clients products its competitors and its future
6263089 you just cant fake the technology know how needed for these tasks
6263090 sophisticated clients see through this and direct the work to attorneys who they know are tops in their respective fields which in many cases are attorneys at boutiques
6263091 no matter what the outcome the general counsel can tell the ceo who in turn can tell the shareholders they hired the biggest name available
6263092 venture capitalists are wowed by big names so if a particular technology looks like startup material we need a firm thats recognized and can do more than ip
6263093 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6263094 i have no reason to pay a fine if i have committed no crime my only crime according to them was to have defended melqu ades hern ndez a young man who was bleeding profusely and on top of that they were beating him
6263095 an order to kill all these f blacks who stick their noses into everything
6263096 when is sending me that email from that one dumb guy
6263097 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6263098 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
6263099 we have some of the best athletes i think weve ever seen at crim
6263100 we certainly have the hottest athletes racing this summer in the united states
6263101 i had a bad feeling about this the nation of islam had extra goons out patrolling the perimeter with pitbulls trained by michale vick i saw him running across the lawn and threw the rope ladder over the wall but the only thing that came over the wall was the book of photos the back of my van was machine gunned by a man who appeared to be george soros only wearing a dress weird but there it is the whole mansion even bigger than saint goreacles and john leftwards had a strange feel to it like some crazy ceremony was going on in there rip claude

6263126 tambi n es importante ver la competencia de otros pa ses y ese estudio lo debe hacer la empresa son aspectos del negocio pero no hay nada insuperable para una empresa que ofrece buena calidad y que tiene la capacidad de proveer el mercado indio
6263127 hay que llevar m s delegaciones empresariales all para que conozcan de primera mano como es el negocio como se divulga cu l es la maquinaria de propaganda etc
6263128 hay que hacer una investigaci n de mercado e identificar nichos en los que colombia tiene capacidad
6263129 as se van a dar una idea de la variedad que existe y van a conocer que en unos sitios hay empresarios m s tradicionales en sus m todos de financiaci n
6263130 si el empresario colombiano tiene una propuesta sabr c mo es su contraparte del sur y el de bombay culturalmente hablando hay complexiones distintas en diferentes lugares y por eso acopi hace bien con una visita tan larga para asimilar las visi n cultural tanto como la empresarial
6263131 hemos logrado exportar algunos productos como el ferron quel donde alcanzamos una posicion significativa carb n algunos productos qu micos y servicios a la vez hemos canalizado inversiones en exploraci n petrolera sector carbonero sector farmac utico y dentro de los servicios tecnolog as de la comunicaci n
6263132 existen oportunidades en muy variados productos pero de forma notable en carb n y esmeraldas tambi n apreciamos espacios en el mercado para caf premium colombiano y tendr amos posibilidades en transporte de energ a operaci n de servicios p blicos y construcci n
6263133 tales atributos les brindan opciones interesantes de asociaci n y posicionamiento en el mercado indio
6263134 nuestra embajada se ha propuesto crear soportes estrat gicos para la relaci n entre india y colombia nuestro objetivo es de largo alcance y excede las coyunturas por ello hemos estimulado los acuerdos entre organizaciones gremiales de los dos paises
6263135 ahora vamos a generar otros convenios con los gremios del comercio y las organizaciones sectoriales

6263141 la cifra que ha sido difundida por la oficina central de estad sticas est subestimada la cifra real puede llegar a 40 millones por ciento en junio para julio puede alcanzar los 300 millones por ciento mientras para agosto podr a llegar a los 600 millones por ciento
6263142 los zimbabueneses deben darse cuenta de que el pa s est en un estado pr cticamente de emergencia socio econ mica
6263143 como tal se necesita una moratoria universal sobre todos los ingresos y los precios por un periodo m nimo de seis meses
6263144 las reservas ponen a brasil en una situaci n privilegiada con posibilidades enormes de tener un nuevo ciclo de crecimiento que pueda durar 10 15 o m s a os para que podamos recuperar las d cadas en que brasil estuvo estancado y solo gener desempleo
6263145 la estatal no existe lo que existe es una discusi n de un consejo interministerial para discutir lo que haremos con el pre sal
6263146 lo fundamental es aprovechar esa gran riqueza para promover un desarrollo m s justo en brasil
6263147 no creo que la nica forma de lograr eso sea con la creaci n de una nueva estatal tambi n se puede aumentar las regal as que reciba el gobierno de la camada pre sal
6263148 una nueva empresa estatal significar a traicionar a los inversionistas de petrobras son miles de brasile os que pusieron sus recursos en la empresa y no van a ver valorizada su inversi n cuando se empiece a explotar estas reservas
6263149 la tendencia a medio largo plazo es que sigan aumentando

6263154 freddie mac y fannie mae tendr an que haber sido cerrados hace diez a os
6263155 una recapitalizaci n es necesaria pero la cuesti n es saber si vendr del sector p blico o del privado
6263156 en el caso de una estatizaci n los tenedores de deuda se van a salvar pero los accionistas perder n toda su inversi n
6263157 por otra parte el mercado se enter hace algunos d as que estos grupos han comprado muchos t tulos hipotecarios de riesgo llamados alt a por un monto que no se conoce
6263158 el problema de freddie y fannie no es su deuda existente que est impl citamente garantizada por el gobierno estadounidense merced al plan de soporte de julio es lo que ellos har n ante una multitud de elementos desconocidos
6263159 ellos deben refinanciar una gran parte de su deuda 223 000 millones de d lares hasta setiembre cabe preguntarse si los inversionistas van a comprar esa deuda
6263160 complementar la protecci n de derechos de propiedad industrial de acuerdo a las exigencias y est ndares multilaterales
6263161 hasta entonces no creo que haya una reducci n de intereses
6263162 estamos en un proceso de estabilizaci n que no implica riesgos para los sectores constructor e inmobiliario y que era obvio luego de seis a os de auge
6263163 muestra de ello es la participaci n de m s de 60 expositores que estar n en el sal n exhibiendo sus proyectos y de paso una interesante agenda acad mica con invitados nacionales y extranjeros que evaluar n diferentes aspectos del sector constructor en todos sus frentes

6263390 as ever with sonys cyber shot range the dsc w300 is as much about style as substance the metal build quality suggests this is a camera that youll still be using a few years down the line a feeling backed up by that whopping 13 megapixel resolution plus its plentifully large and bright rear lcd look back at a camera from four or five years ago when 1 5 inches was the norm and find a product looking positively prehistoric unfortunately though while images appear fine when viewed in isolation anyone who has handled a wide variety of digital compacts as us reviewers are privileged to do will discover that image quality is perhaps the least impressive aspect of the w300 thats a shame as among its bridge cameras im thinking of the h50 and dslrs alpha 350 at the mid range sony has delivered some surprisingly impressive photographic models of late all that being said noise is handled very well and shots do require a minimal amount of post processing out of the camera so in that respect the sony cyber shot dsc w300 could be said to be ideally suited to its target market of the undemanding snapper who requires visual aide memoirs delivered with the minimum of fuss

6263470 we realize the crusade model of ministry we have pursued is outdated and were pursuing new and innovative to reach out

6263487 everyone knows i love la but london watch coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie
6263488 i am a homeschooling mom to three and have been married for seventeen years i live in central california and fill the hot hot summers with lots of swimming in our little back yard oasis
6263489 well i can tell you that i am participating in rak scraps mega kits for july and august so watch for freebies and coupons there

6263491 statistics show that teen pregnancy drops off significantly after age twenty five
6263492 were sending the wrong message when we use taxpayer dollars to give condoms out to these kids and we dont tell them by the way youll be probably dead at age twenty four by cervical cancer but were giving you condoms so go do your thing
6263493 when i learned of the discovery i couldnt help but wonder once again how much farther down the road wed be with this research if we had been able to use federal dollars to help along the way
6263494 i could see her coming and she just kept coming
6263495 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6263496 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6263497 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that
6263498 its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6263499 its his anatomy hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart
6263500 and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time and he recognized the responsibility of seizing the moment and he did it
6263501 i told myself if im going to get this record its going to be here because the track is really fast
6263502 i told myself im going to go out there and give it my all and i went out there and just left everything on the track
6263503 i just want to chill out i just want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6263504 the kind of money one earns here in a short period is something you cant get in many years it is a brilliant opportunity and im not going to throw it away
6263505 each one of us has so many layers so many facets to our personality and im all set to do any role dark challenging and perhaps even play a beggar
6263506 all i had was enthusiasm and confidence i dont regret any decision i consider it as an enriching experience i am still learning and even considering to dub for my characters
6263507 i love shopping here and yes the biryani this place is so much like mumbai the night life everything is so lively its growing each day
6263508 i lose a child that i was so prepared for and for something i could have avoided
6263509 i would not have taken the drugs i would not have breastfed and taken the drug
6263510 i dont think there is a reason to be scared but there is a reason to be informed
6263511 i dont think people should be scared but like many other drugs women and doctors should be aware that something we thought was safe may not be safe
6263512 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6263513 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6263514 its not a matter of size its a matter of skill
6263515 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6263516 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
6263517 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6263518 my first priority is to win every davis cup tie and if lleyton was fit he would obviously be there
6263519 but it is going to be a potential step up for someone it is something that has been coming for a while
6263520 who knows what could happen and how they will react some react very positively and some struggle but you dont know until you test them
6263521 the most important thing at the moment is for australia to bring along their best young players
6263522 bernard and carsten and brydan are great young players and it is a terrific thing that one or two of them could get a chance as harry hopman used to blood young players in davis cup
6263523 in the days of hopman he used to bring along players of potential and give them a chance to play at the earliest opportunity
6263524 they are more likely to create an impact and do great things than more senior players because they are not battle scarred by a series of losses
6263525 the fedex cup is what is attracting me out here again this week and the idea of it is to get players out to compete at this time of year harrington said
6263526 after two majors you think well i could do with a rest but theres other things to play for so thats why im here this week
6263527 im looking forward to playing it the barclays is on a very nice golf course harrington said
6263528 anybody realistically in the top 10 i suppose if they get a win in this tournament and then follow it up with some good performances they can win the fedex cup he said
6263529 anybody outside it might take two wins so theres a lot to play for and im ready to go
6263530 no hay nada m s lindo que jugar con el seleccionado por m s que ma ana todos digan que empatamos 0 a 0 con bielorrusia y no sirve para nada con la camiseta celeste y blanca me voy a cualquier parte porque me gusta ser el jugador del pueblo la gente sabe que doy todo por esta camiseta
6263531 ojal podamos traer la medalla dorada yo s lo que se siente ganarla adem s si la logran va a servir para potenciar a los mayores porque los pibes van a crecer

6263535 upgrade from sql server 2005 to 2008 is a pretty simple process

6263540 were still going to rep booker back there but were going to try and get quintin a majority of the reps
6263541 we kind of had a feeling that it was either going to be lorenzo or quintin
6263542 my confidence has gotten better every day that ive gotten better
6263543 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly
6263544 thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about he has never backed down from what he said
6263545 people laughed at him when he said they would win the nl east and then as the season continued on everybody started getting excited about it jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it and they will get that win streak and hopefully be in the world series
6263546 i have noticed no rust he is a natural player its good to have shawn back
6263547 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
6263548 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
6263549 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
6263550 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumor mill now i dont wear a knee brace i wore this wrap today really for the first time
6263551 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
6263552 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on sept 7 but my guess is they will be
6263553 were going to let howard play a little left and right get him on the field as much as possible hes having a good camp
6263554 hes a right end no question about it but hes a good pass rusher and were going to work him hes mainly a right end and our inside tackle and nickel guy
6263555 one of my strengths is my versatility i can play anywhere its going to take a couple weeks to get back into it
6263556 everything you did with your right hand you have to learn to do with your left hand
6263557 if youre a guy on the right side and pulling a jersey with your right hand trying to get around the edge you got to learn to do it with your left hand
6263558 its not a matter of quickness once you do something so long you get muscle memory your body does things before you even think about it when you are not used to doing stuff and you have to think about it and then do it you might be a little slower
6263559 you are thinking while youre moving and thinking before you put your hand on the ground
6263560 you get into your stance and try to remember which hand you put down and which foot you move first
6263561 its not just after the snap but before the snap its more rushing the passer and turning the corner instead of using your left hand as your power hand on the run on the offensive tackle you now have to use your right hand
6263562 theres a lot of competition there mcdougle is pushing them
6263563 i picked up the defense i was able to go out and show them some of the things i was able to do its the reason they brought me in here its unfortunate this injury came up
6263564 you read the papers they say we have no chance even in the nfc
6263565 but it really doesnt matter what people say as long as the 53 guys we go into the season with believe in ourselves and we go out there and play giants football well be fine i know a lot of people are saying theres no michael strahan no jeremy shockey no gibril wilson no kawika mitchell but weve got guys who stepped in last year and played a lot they will continue to do that and i feel confident in our coaching staff and the people we have around here to get it done
6263566 we had one pro bowler last year osi umenyiora defensive end was our only pro bowler so were not sexy we dont have all the big names and that kind of stuff
6263567 were kind of a blue collar team and i think it does put a little bit of a chip on our shoulder to hear people say you know what last year was a fairy tale itll never happen again well these guys want to prove that it can
6263568 were definitely going to miss him said umenyiora who had a career high 13 sacks last season six of which came in a 16 3 week 4 win over the eagles
6263569 whenever you take a hall of famer out of your defense its going to affect you tremendously he was a great player i dont know if anybody is going to be able to step up the way he played we have good football players but were talking about michael strahan here
6263570 having those two guys on the outside was tremendously important
6263571 it was basically pick your poison you had three guys that can get after the quarterback obviously we didnt sack him every time but just having that threat that capability gets a quarterback off his timing off his rhythm
6263572 you could tell the week of the super bowl how we felt said umenyiora
6263573 we felt we could beat that football team we felt we could get to brady when we played them in week 17 we hit him 17 times they had a very good offensive line but we felt we were a better defensive line so we just went out there and tried to do what we do
6263574 we still have a lot of people who can rush the passer umenyiora said
6263575 you take michael out of the equation obviously youre losing a great player but i think kiwanuka can rush the passer so can dave tollefson we have some guys who can step in there and do a good job
6263576 were going to try to get quintin a majority of the reps
6263577 im never uncomfortable catching passes because ive done it before ive never done that before so im just a little more excited to make a play because you want to prove to yourself first that you can do it you forget the small stuff when you get excited it was one of those games i made kick return look like it was rocket science
6263578 i guess i might be a little biased because hes a safety but ive liked what ive seen demps do
6263579 i think hes a playmaker back there in the secondary hes going to have to work on his eyes a little bit hes in the backfield too much but i think thats because hes always trying to make a play on the ball i think hes a guy that has impressed me with his athleticism also
6263580 he has the right mentality for it hes not a prima donna nothing like that he comes in and he works hard
6263581 he adds so much to your return game in terms of speed and ability
6263582 get it and go thats what youve got to do punt return more of a little hesitation to see where the hole might be kickoff return youve got to catch it and get vertical
6263583 youve got to find a thin line between your responsibility and looking at the quarterback so long
6263584 being young you try to make a play so much thats all you try to do is make a play for me coming from college thats all i did was stare into the backfield and make plays by anticipating throws you cant do that in this league man its totally impossible its too fast the speed is too much and youve got to be technique sound
6263585 its the hardest thing for a young defensive back to come into the league with all the little techniques
6263586 quintins going to be a good football player hes got some habits and were correcting that one of the corrections is to make sure he concentrates on the receivers hes in a learning process too its going to take him a little while but im very happy with quintin
6263587 you have to have an individual who first of all you trust to do both and then that individual has to be of a mind set to not be afraid to do one or the other
6263588 some people are afraid to get into contact so thats why safety is out for them and some people are scared to get out there in corner what we call the highway out there because of that speed
6263589 it takes an individual with athletic ability absolutely but you have to have a mental toughness about you also to be able to step out there and line up against receivers out there on that highway and hold your own ive always given every corner that ive played with i give them a whole bunch of credit for lining up out there and doing what they do its a grown mans job at any given time you can get taken deep and you have to have a short memory to be able to line up again
6263590 howard is a right end theres no question about it
6263591 but we are going to work him in a little bit at left because hes a good pass rusher
6263592 mcdougle is pushing hes got two more preseason games so well know more then
6263593 this has become one of those situations where theres competition between mcdougle and chris clemons
6263594 we have to get chris back on the field until we get him back on the field were just not going to know
6263595 i just want to stay focused on staying on the field
6263596 thats been the biggest thing in my whole career the injuries
6263597 as long as i stay on the field and play up to my potential everything else is going to fall into place im not there yet i just want to keep improving
6263598 it sets you back a lot when you cant go out and compete and be at the top of your game stay in shape and practice
6263599 we need as many healthy players as we can get right now
6263600 when ive been out there its been going well ive been able to pick up the defense ive been able to go out and show some of the things im capable of doing show some of the reasons they brought me in here its unfortunate the injury has come at a critical time
6263601 i think its just hey the best players are going to play
6263602 i can say i think hes come a long way
6263603 were wrapping up the process of assigning numbers and are shooting for friday of this week to begin sending correspondences which will take a couple of days to hit members email addresses
6263604 its not really fair to put them back on the list

6263610 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice
6263611 he looks pretty good hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust
6263612 he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick he plays the game natural meaning with instinctive athleticism he plays it naturally low he can bend his knees and he plays the game low its good to have shawn back hes working hard and preparing hard well see what happens here i would expect him to play very well
6263613 im not exactly where i would normally be at this point in camp
6263614 i would normally be in better football shape theres no type of running in the world that you can possibly do to match with football i trained with a 20 pound vest this offseason still once you put the pads on and everything else its different its a lot different
6263615 i do feel like myself im getting back into it mentally i know all my plays physically i feel pretty good id like to think im playing at new england but well see

6263666 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6263667 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6263668 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6263669 he took up the challenge the responsibility and scored those runs

6263687 the company reaffirms the guidance for 2008 he said in a statement
6263688 santos has continued its sound operating performance in 2008 mr knox said
6263689 regrettably the lower production rate necessitates a reduction in our workforce from 760 to 320 employees
6263690 the affected employees will be provided with their full entitlements and supported in the transition the decision to reduce our workforce has not been taken lightly and we are mindful of the impact upon individuals their families and the community we firmly believe that this is the best option to ensure continuity of operations and to preserve the mine for the long term benefit of the community and the shareholders
6263691 the resizing at the broken hill operation is prudent conserves cash and positions the operation for the future the company is confident that the broken hill operation can be sustained to maintain a level of continuity of production and one that is financially viable at current metal prices for at least the next 2 to 3 years without significant compromise to the longer term life of mine
6263692 should metal prices increase in the future we will be in a strong position to ramp up production at the broken hill operation and to utilise the full potential of the broken hill concentrator with ore sources from the southern operations potosi the north mine and flying doctor
6263693 perilya is in a sound financial position with cash reserves and low debt to weather the current period of low metal prices

6263699 i would not have taken the drugs i would not have breastfed and taken the drug
6263700 i dont think there is a reason to be scared but there is a reason to be informed
6263701 i dont think people should be scared but like many other drugs women and doctors should be aware that something we thought was safe may not be safe
6263702 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6263703 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects

6263798 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6263799 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6263800 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6263801 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6263802 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6263803 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6263804 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6263805 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6263806 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6263807 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6263808 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6263809 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6263810 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6263811 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6263812 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6263813 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6263814 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6263815 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6263816 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6263817 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6263818 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6263819 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6263820 as you know we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of community and the leocop ladbrokes european online championship of poker is like our annual family gathering its the one time you can guarantee that everyone will make an appearance its a chance to catch up with friends and acquaintances learn from the old school and as grazza graeme newman demonstrated in 2006 when he won the main event sometimes its a rare opportunity to teach an old dog a trick or two and perhaps pick up the massive cheque at the end of it all of course the kudos and the massive prize pools are also very good reasons that players europe wide play this fantastic event
6263821 attempt by the anti car fanatics to screw up our traffic on behalf of the bicycle fantasy
6263822 see baracks been um talking down to black people on this faith based i want to cut his fucking balls off barack hes talking down to black people
6263823 not that i expect socialists to respect property but still
6263824 its caught the heart of australians and at the moment the public is really really desperately wanting something to save the whale
6263825 socialism nothing more than the theory that the slave is always more virtuous than his master
6263826 we have worked with a variety of algae companies that we think will become producers
6263827 we can work with algae companies who are trying to define what they are trying to do from a strain selection perspective to the smartest way to scale up to a commercial scale
6263828 he wanted calm so that the government can continue to administer the country
6263829 they have to wait and see what will come first a house dissolution or a dissolution of the people power party
6263830 they the pad can exercise their rights and perform their duties under the constitution as long as they want
6263831 all cases against the party and its members are in legal proceedings this will decide our fate not the pad
6263832 our target is prime minister samak he cannot be the legitimate leader of the country because his party gained the majority votes from political fraud
6263833 since khun samak is not ashamed by those facts and remains in the post it is our duty to topple him
6263834 khun samak has shown his intention to do everything to help thaksin even though it is not successful he has lost legitimacy to run the country with dignity and integrity not to mention his court cases and corruption allegations
6263835 he has developed his political moves quickly his latest move in controlling the capital market and stock exchange is worrying for possible manipulation
6263836 khun samak must be ousted from the post as soon as possible
6263837 after more than 70 days of protest the government apparently has gotten used to having us around and is turning a deaf ear on our demands the pad protest has become just a public gathering which is not right
6263838 we have to discuss new ways to put pressure on khun samak maybe protest at various provincial offices to obstruct their work as he earlier accused us of maybe that is a good idea actually they provincial officials deserve such protests because they are serving a corrupt government
6263839 they told me there are going to be resources here thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6263840 if it werent for jesus it would be very difficult for me to follow god when you read the old testament now knowing exactly where the book is going it is all very easy and simple but it wouldnt have been that way to the characters in actual history if i had been around back in the old testament god would have come off as more or less frightening and i dont think i would have been able to know in my heart that it was the grandness of his nature not the ease of his anger that produced the fear
6263841 my friend pennys dad says he thinks god was angry for awhile after the fall then got over it sent his son and is now pretty well adjusted and forgiving and of course i dont think that is exactly how it is but i can understand why pennys dad would read the bible this way but my other friend john macmurray says that every time he gives the bible to a person to read for the first time even if they dont agree with it they see god as a person who is incredibly patient with humanity john pointed out that it takes god hundreds of years to finally get angry enough to lay any sort of punishment on his enemies hes like france in that way
6263842 are you sure youre going home because youre sick and not because your boyfriends at home

6263845 chinese reporters understood from the beginning they understood seven years ago when these promises were made that these promises were not about them at all
6263846 ever since beijing was awarded the olympics all chinese journalists have understood that when the olympics rolled around they would be subject to tighter controls not more real openings
6263847 they created new mechanisms like the news commentary group in the propaganda department which was not just censorship how it worked in the past but actually a group of officials who would look at what they called propaganda discipline after reports came out
6263848 sometimes the commercial media would push the envelope and theyd think more about readers and what readers wanted to see and theyd think more about advertising dollars than they would about the propaganda discipline
6263849 this is really the latest innovation responding to the growth of the internet
6263850 censors youd call them in some of their capacity but also theyre designed by the party as a new form to really amplify the party messages or pro party messages in chatrooms and on the internet
6263851 immediately prior to the games opening we were very concerned that a blogger named huang qi was formally charged with inciting state subversion for posting a few pieces on his own blog that speculated about the possibility of corruption as a contributing factor in childrens death in the sichuan earthquake
6263852 somewhere somebody along the line decided that huang qi shouldnt have said what he said online and for that he stands a good chance of spending three and a half years in prison
6263853 theres a sense that the web commentators and their presence and their activity on the internet really further erodes the atmosphere of trust on the internet
6263854 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6263855 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6263856 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6263857 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6263858 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6263859 so far we have been defending our territory but this postpaid plans will mark as the beginning of our attackmove
6263860 i have one race to go i have to refocus again to get one more gold medal
6263861 i dont want to say anything too serious because my coach might want me to run 400 meters
6263862 anything is possible if i put my mind to it im not worried about that now dont hold your breath i dont think ill be going up to the 400 any time soon
6263863 the 200 has been my love since i was 15
6263864 i was the youngest ever to win world juniors it means a lot to me its dear to my heart the 200 means more to me than the 100
6263865 i wont compare myself to michael phelps to win eight gold medals thats great im on the track and hes in the water you cant compare the two
6263866 theres nothing on the roads before the race was run
6263867 he ran 52 flat for the 400 on a grass track
6263868 i got up at 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious i didnt want to go to the cafeteria i went straight to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6263869 i thought he robbed us of another great performance in the 100 because i thought he could run 9 50
6263870 im so pleased i thought if he runs if he truly runs this is his olympic games its magical none of us thought world record i thought 19 55 19 52
6263871 i assume his first 100 had to be faster than michael
6263872 a 6 5 sprinter with cat like feet and the turnover to match the smaller guys if he has the same tempo and takes nine foot strides its ridiculous you just cant match it
6263873 hes bad he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record
6263874 im serious hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6263875 why are you spending so much time on this one
6263876 i am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart
6263877 not only will she be able to think she will be able to reason and negotiate
6263878 oops it looks like you have a leak in this model
6263879 if you purchase my 30 day bum marketing blueprint and can complete the tasks provided each day you will end up with 82 articles written in three different niches a month from now
6263880 for the author this book represents a bold new direction into the world of business and economics
6263881 i want to believe people i cant believe somebody would go to so much trouble to try to take advantage of you
6263882 if this is the only life youve got then youve got to do everything you want to do now
6263883 a number of our players perform consistently well in online events such as the leocop but with limited exposure to live play their successes do not translate well in the live arena it is our hope that this event will be a solution to that problem
6263884 the weekend should give our players the tools and confidence they require to adapt and maximise elements of their online game to suit a live game and ultimately to win
6263885 usually on a concussion sometimes youre a little sensitive to light
6263886 were going to let them rest for a day or so then see where they are
6263887 its a good opportunity for me to get more reps more playing time
6263888 we definitely wanted to put on a better show especially on monday night playing against new york the defending super bowl champs
6263889 i hope tokio hotel comes out of their busses while ur gone gt d
6263890 let me put it this way we need the xeloda to work
6263891 its a while since i have been under the radar maybe 01 or 02
6263892 but i am not someone who needs someone talking about them i am more concerned with how i am playing i realize there are better storylines this summer roger federer losing his number one ranking rafael nadal novak djokovic playing well on hard courts and
6263893 i just want to play well and i feel like i can make a big run there i know i can certainly compete
6263894 would i do it again yes because it was wimbledon
6263895 cincinnati is one of my favorite events usually a tournament that i do well in so missing that put a little hole in the summer
6263896 i think not going to the olympics is actually beneficial for me right now i have been able to squeeze in two more tournaments in washington and la my expectations are a lot better than they were when i was sitting on a couch after cincinnati
6263897 thats actually a question ive thought about before and i think i change my answer daily
6263898 the last time i played the u s open normal was back in 2001 when i got to the semi finals probably it was so long ago
6263899 every time i started to play well i was getting injured even when i was number one i got injured with the rib i couldnt play for two months and my ranking dropped and i lost confidence
6263900 but i am getting back again the results will come eventually the ranking doesnt really matter if you get the results it will come back
6263901 its been just over one year for us now and i am pretty satisfied
6263902 i am a little old to do certain things over the years it gets tougher and tougher to play well especially when you compare yourself with the years before
6263903 he understands he has a lot of patience and is the ideal person to travel with which is very important i am not under any pressure
6263904 the knee was difficult and i was risking a little too much
6263905 thats why my ranking dropped because without confidence you cannot make any more winners from the back of the court
6263906 all of a sudden the pain was gone and i could start at least to work on the movement i started to cover the court better doing more work in the gym
6263907 no you have to move by class tomorrow you know what i have a better idea why dont we kill you with sticks geepers that sounds swell
6263908 then i would look like a pirate i need a parrot but i dont like birds
6263909 a double negative is a line with a space in it
6263910 baby dont puss out d o n t d r i n k m i l k dont drink that shit
6263911 you cant get pregnant until we both go to the bar together
6263912 let me put it this way we need the xeloda to work
6263913 wifey lets stay home tonight its joanas last week and she would probably rather not see you
6263914 n o acho que n o vou tomar aquele empr stimo e comprar aquela m quina nova vai que o mercado vira o credito escasseia etc

6263923 ecodriving produces the highest mileage from every single vehicle regardless of vehicle size and age so it offers an unmatched reach in addressing energy and climate issues by potentially affecting the nations entire fleet of 245 million automobiles
6263924 sample ecodriving practices include not tailgating knowing the proper way to accelerate and brake using synchronized traffic lights to a drivers advantage driving at the optimum highway speed understanding when to use air conditioning and much more sample maintenance practices include knowing which motor oil to use understanding the importance of proper tire pressure and what affects tire pressure understanding aerodynamics and much more
6263925 annual co2 emissions could be reduced by about 100 million tons or the equivalent of heating and powering 8 5 million households
6263926 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today
6263927 just wait a little longer and youll be able to buy new cars and trucks which will help this serious problem really theyre just around the corner

6263930 channing tatum pictures of the week chan and jenna on vacation in mexico
6263931 agar kami mempunyai alasan pelepas tanggung jawab kepada tuhanmu dan supaya mereka bertakwa
6263932 selama ini aku asyik tegur orang je tapi aku sendiri masih banyak kekurangan cepat marah suka buang masa ade gak dosa dosa yang masih dilakukan macam mana ya
6263933 alah kau tu cakap je berapi gaya alim tapi couple gak sama aje kau dengan kami tegur orang konon
6263934 kalaulah betul couple tu salah habis tu nak buat macam mana aku kena clash ke alah buat apa fikir macam tu tanya je la kalau tak buat salah apa nak ditakutkan
6263935 er macam ni sebelum saya terlibat dengan dakwah ni saya ada kenal seorang kawan ni perempuan la tapi bukanla setakat kawan biasa rapat gak la bukan rapat biasa tapi rapatla
6263936 akhi memang fitrah manusia lelaki akan tertarik kepada perempuan begitu juga perempuan akan tertarik kepada lelaki tapi dalam islam perasaan itu perlu dikawal dan ada batasnya pergaulan perlu dijaga allah firman dalam surah al isra surah ke 17 dalam ayat yg ke 32
6263937 tapi bang saya tak nampak pun yang kami ni menghampiri zina niat kami baik saya dah cuba sedaya upaya mengawal perhubungan kami sms pun takdelah jiwang jiwang selalu bagi tazkirah lagi kami selang selang bagi hari ni saya esok dia
6263938 memang betul niat nta baik tapi ingat niat tak pernah menghalalkan cara yang batil tetap sahaja batil yang haq tetap haq cuba tengok ayat ni
6263939 akhi kalau nta paham ayat ni sebenarnya apa yang berlaku pada nta ialah setan telah buat nta pandang indah benda buruk yang nta lakukan walaupun nta berpandangan tajam maksudnya nta berilmu tinggi memang pada mulanya niat nta baik tapi ingat syaitan itu sangat licik dia akan sedaya upaya buat nta terjerumus ke dalam kemaksiatan lagipun takkanlah sepanjang masa nta sms dengan dia nta ingat allah mesti ada masanya nta hanya melayan perasaan dengan dia kan
6263940 tapi bang saya dah janji dengan dia taknak jumpa lg sebab saya tahu kalau berjumpa nanti banyak bahayanya dan dia pun setuju kami sama sama menjaga diri takkanlah ia boleh membawa kepada zina juga bang
6263941 em betul nta dah janji taknak jumpa dengan dia lagi nta dah dapat elakkan zina mata zina tangan zina kaki kalau nta janji taknak call die pula nta dapat elak zina telinga dan zina lidah tapi akh masih ada zina yang tetap nta tak dapat elak apabila bercouple
6263942 betul zina hati semua inilah yang rasulullah jelaskan dalam hadithnya tentang bagaimana menghampiri zina tu nta boleh check dalam riyadahus solihin bawah bab larangan melihat wanita rasulullah bersabda mata boleh berzina dgn melihat lidah boleh berzina dengan bercakap tangan boleh berzina dengan berpegangan kaki boleh berzina dengan berjalan ke arah tempat maksiat hati pula boleh berzina dgn merindui mengingati dan membayangi si dia hakikatnye macam mana pun nta buat nta tetap tak dapat lari daripada zina hati
6263943 ana dulu pun couple gak lagi lama daripada nta sejak sekolah sampai dah masuk u dekat nak gred tapi bila ana sedar apa yang ana buat ni salah ana trus tinggalkan ana siap dah fikir dialah bakal isteri ana yang akan jadi ibu kepada anak anak ana kalau nak diikutkan lagi besar masalah ana daripada nta
6263944 saya risau la bang nanti apa kawan kawan dia kata dulu saya selalu minta tolong mereka untuk rapat dengan dia mesti nanti mereka semua tak puas hati dengan saya dan dia sendiri pula saya takut apa apa akan jadi pada dia kalau dia tak dapat terima keputusan ni sebab kami dah rapat sgt
6263945 kalau kawan kawan dia tak puas hati pun mereka boleh buat apa paling teruk pun mereka akan mengata di belakang nta nta tak kurang sikit pun lagipun dalam berdakwah ni kita nak cari redha allah biarlah orang nak kata apa apa sekali pun yang penting redha allah kalau allah tak redha semuanya dah tak bermakna lagi
6263946 pasal die pula cube nta fikir dari sudut positif mungkin dia akan terima keputusan nta scara matang mungkin dia juga akan buat keputusan untuk tidak lagi bercouple ana yakin die takkan buat apa apa perkara bodoh kalau die buat sekalipun itu bukan tagguungjawab nta apa yang nta nak buat tu betul meninggalkan maksiat semua orang akan tanggung balasan atas perbuatannya sndiri
6263947 ana dulu hantar satu sms je kat dia ana terangkan pada dia hubungan yang dibina itu salah minta maaf kita berakhir di sini tolong jangan cari saya lagi lepas itu ana terus tukar nombor ana tak hubungi dia langsung lepas tu
6263948 maksudnya saya tak boleh hubungi dia lagi ke tapi bang saya ade juga kawan perempuan lain boleh pula saya hubungi mereka
6263949 dengan dia ni lain nta dah pernah ada sejarah dengan dia tapi kalau nanti ditaqdirkan nta satu universiti dengan dia satu kuliah lepas tu kena pula buat group discussion masa tu nta hanya layan dia hanya sebagai group discussion partner
6263950 dia ni nak suruh aku clash malam ni gak ke sekarang gak takkanlah awal sangat
6263951 saya rasa saya belum ade kekuatan la bang boleh tak saya tunggu sampai saya ada kekuatan baru saya tiggalkan benda ni
6263952 akh nta kena ingat kekuatan itu tidak boleh ditunggu tapi ia perlu dibina allah tidak akan mengubah keadaan sesuatu kaum sehingga kaum itu mengubah keadaannya sendiri nta boleh rujuk surah surah ke 13 ayat 11 lagipun nta nak tuggu sampai bila baru nak tinggalkan couple ni abang abang fasilitator ni pun ramai yang pernah couple bila masuk dakwah mereka tiggalkan
6263953 semuanya dah jelas rasanya nampaknya saya kena tiggalkanla benda ni gak ye macam tak larat rasanya nak tekan button handphone ni rasa tak sanggup
6263954 semuanya dah jelas buat apa aku tangguh tangguh lagi takut nanti hidayah ni allah tarik susah pula nak tinggalkan kan aku selalu doa supaya dijauhkan dari maksiat jadi rasanya inilah masanya
6263955 assalamualaikum sebenarnya selama ini hubungan kita salah di sisi islam saya ingat dengan mengubah cara pergaulan kita ia dah dibolehkan tapi sebenarnya ia tetap berdosa saya harap awak akan istiqamah meneruskan perubahan yang awak dah buat kerana allah saya minta maaf atas segala yang dah berlaku kalau ada jodoh insya allah akan bertemu juga assalamualaikum
6263956 tiada yang lebih indah daripada mendapat keredahaan ilahi seindah manapun gubahan pertama tu selagi tak mendapat keredahaannya tetap tiada gunanya
6263957 kami minta semua pihak tidak sembarangan membuat isu ketiga pegawai bpd yang dipecat itu sama sekali tidak ada hubungannya dengan kasus kutim
6263958 ada pengelolaan dana deposito yang secara aturan perbankan menyalahi ketentuan
6263959 jadi pejabat bpd kutai timur yang dipecat itu terkait kesalahan prosedural dalam mengelola beberapa rekening deposito di kantor cabang kutai timur apa yang mereka lakukan tidak sesuai ketentuan standard operating procedur sop bpd kaltim
6263960 ketiganya dilakukan pemecatan sejak 2005 bukan baru jadi sudah lama dipecat sebelum kasus bukit pelangi muncul jadi tidak ada kaitannya kasus bukit pelangi itu dengan pemecatan pegawai bpd
6263961 sehingga masih ada keterkaitan dan tanggung jawab pemimpin cabang pada saat itu itu yang sekarang masih diteliti
6263962 saya tidak pernah menyebutkan nama atau menuduh seseorang tapi sebenarnya saya mempunyai bukti bukti kuat mengenai hal itu
6263963 tapi saya tidak mau memperpanjang hal ini dan saya tidak ingin berpolemik dengan pihak lain masih banyak yang lebih penting untuk diurus
6263964 kami bisa saja memaparkan bukti bukti itu tapi untuk apa lebih baik tidak usah berpolemik
6263965 the nanofabrication of hard x ray fresnel zone plates is a very difficult task because of extreme and conflicting technical requirements
6263966 spatial resolution requires very thin outermost zones however high efficiency with weakly absorbed hard x rays imposes a high aspect ratio the reconciliation of such requirements is problematic stable thin nanostructures with high aspect ratio are difficult to fabricate as a result progress was so far limited to soft x rays and the spatial resolution for hard x rays remained above 40 50 nm this is regrettable since it rules out many important applications in biomedical research most notably subcellular structure studies in tissues
6263967 our focusing device pushes the record of spatial resolution in radiology to a new level that is particularly important for studies of cells
6263968 the difference with respect to visible light zone plates is that the circles are very small and thin in the range of tens of nanometers
6263969 their fabrication is very complicated since to interact with x rays that are weakly absorbed the lines must also be quite deep our approach solved the problem of combining small thickness and large depth pushing the x ray lens focusing performance to new limits
6263970 the high electron energy enabled us to focus the electron beam down to a 5 nm diameter and reduce backscattering related problems
6263971 as to pulsed electrodeposition the optimized parameters for our best fzps were a 0 2 second pulse width a 40 second pulse distance room temperature and a current density of 0 5 asd ampere per square decimeter pulsed electrodeposition was specifically better than dc electrodeposition in filling the narrow trenches of the outermost fzp zones
6263972 the resolution only depends on the outermost zone width whereas the efficiency depends on the metal structure thickness
6263973 the efficiency is important not only for time resolved applications but also to reduce negative effects for example of vibrations and background inhomogeneities a limited photon flux leads to long exposure times that worsen such effects
6263974 i think we have a group of players who work hard for each other and are passionate to do well there are areas we can still improve on but i think we are going into it with good spirits and with two difficult away games hopefully we can come back with some points
6263975 at the moment there are maybe four or five players on the borderline of being fit for the match in macedonia so thats going to dictate the team
6263976 we have been a bit unfortunate since i took over with injuries but there is nothing you can do about that it gives other players opportunities to come in
6263977 once we know who is going to be available that will give me a clearer mind what team i am going to play
6263978 this is not possible guns only kill people guns are only owned by criminals she should have simply waited for the police
6263979 i wonder what would have happened if she werent allowed to defend herself with a gun
6263980 someone who is anti gun is not a coward or pussy per se s he is just ignorant of prevailing statistics and unwilling to change his mind even in the face of evidence to the contrary
6263981 this woman should be locked up in prison did she not consider the poor mans economic position which forced him to try and rob her did she not consider the emotional well being of this poor man having a gun pointed him she should have thought about his life and the way he lived and his problems before threatening him with a gun oh i just cant believe they didnt lock her up for crimes against humanity and racism
6263982 i got on and sat my beautiful glutes in a row of two unused seats facing forward taking the window seat its a good thing too because a perfectly poundable asian pussy rested its lips on the seat next to me
6263983 i am surprised hes holding out i dont know where hes getting his ad about 1 month ago
6263984 it was a stupid joke and i admit to that
6263985 i called it thugery it is thugery if youre referring to your members as enforcers and theyre gonna come down hard on you if you dont contribute thats thugery
6263986 at this point when youre winning the way senate democrats are theres no other way to distract other than to try and put rumors out there to divide the plan that we have
6263987 i believe the senate republican majority is going to remain next year people are beginning to understand that we represent suburban interests we represent decreasing property taxes and we dont represent shaking down people for contributions
6263988 el electorado nacional tras el refer ndum ha dado tareas para lograr la unidad del pa s creemos que el parlamento debe tener un papel protag nico

6263992 i was standing outside for my few minutes outside at my cell a vietnamese guard came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his sandal on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together ill never forget that moment
6263993 as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible
6263994 it was pretty bad two of the animals that were seized from the property had severe imbedded collars it was like someone got a knife and sliced the whole neck of the animal it was split open
6263995 they were scared they cowered down they wouldnt move they thought i was going to hit them and we were just trying to remove them from the chains and help them out
6263996 i know ill be pushing for him to not get these animals back due to the conditions they were living in

6264006 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6264007 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown

6264013 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6264014 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6264015 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6264016 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6264017 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6264018 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6264019 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6264020 we are not aware of any australians involved in the incident however our embassy in madrid is in contact with local authorities hospitals and the airline to ascertain if any australians are affected a dfat spokeswoman said

6264023 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6264024 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6264025 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6264026 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6264027 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6264028 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6264029 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6264030 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6264031 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6264032 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6264033 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6264034 that is the reason why we are looking at the buyback and why so much of it is geared towards the northern end of the system
6264035 love is sufficient of itself it pleases of itself and for the sake of loving a great thing is love if yet it returns to its principle if it is restored to its origin if it finds its way back again to its fountain head so that it may thus be enabled to flow on unfailingly amidst all the emotions sentiments and feelings of the soul love is outstanding in this respect namely that it alone among created things has the power to correspond with and to make return to the creator in kind though not in equality

6264042 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6264043 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6264044 it was an accident as explosives hidden in gravel to be used in road construction went off injuring two children and a woman normally i would have rushed to the spot and treated the victims but on tuesday i had to make a hasty retreat as people were boiling with anger and i feared they would lynch me
6264045 police behaved decently with me and i am free but my image is tainted now and i will have to live with a terrorist tag for the rest my life
6264046 as a student i was alloted room number 27 at the sms medical college in jaipur which is now occupied by abrar ali who is in police custody i had left some of my books with abrar and police picked me after finding my name on the books
6264047 i was reading a newspaper at my home in the morning at 9 30 am suddenly a team of policemen arrived and asked me to accompany them for a meeting with the local inspector

6264050 the centre was of the opinion that if the unlawful activities of simi were not curbed and controlled immediately it would take the opportunity to continue its subversive activities and reorganize its activities members who are still absconding disrupt the secular fabric of the country by polluting the minds of the people by creating communal disharmony propagating anti national sentiments escalate secessionism by supporting militancy

6264054 my placement company is the first indian company that exclusively deals with the recruitment in china indians have great future there as they are being paid high salaries five to 10 times higher than in india china finds indian workforce good for them as they are more cost effective as compared to their western counterparts
6264055 the chinese are good at manufacturing but they lack the communication information technology and managerial skills which we mastered long back the scenario in china is equivalent to the it scenario in india in 1998 since we have gone through the same and owing to the asian links we are very useful to them we are in touch with premier universities of both the countries
6264056 ive never said this before of any other camera but the d300 actually makes it easier to create significantly better images than with earlier cameras
6264057 jaguar is very very proud to receive this wonderful award it is the proof that jaguar is back and the xf is just the beginning of our new story for the future just wait until you see the new xj and beyond
6264058 jaguars xf is a machine that has proved the doubters wrong its a car that impresses on every level from design to drivability practicality to price
6264059 but thats not the only reason why our judges chose this car our winner has raised the standards in a class where excellence is considered the norm its a home grown package designed and developed in the uk and built by a highly skilled workforce
6264060 this has been a fantastic year for jaguar with the xf leading the success of our revitalisation plan
6264061 the manner in which the two explosive laden cars were abandoned in surat shows that the module there may have developed cold feet

6264063 on her arm she tried to hide it with her dress but i could still see it isnt that cool
6264064 boring it was just talk talk talk talk talk and i had to listen
6264065 it means we can appeal to people who are disillusioned with traditional church
6264066 the flip side is the uncertainty has meant weve seen people we otherwise wouldnt have seen who have come along because they are asking the big questions about life
6264067 there needs to be a spiritual reality there especially in the current very tough times
6264068 many people who spend their whole life just focusing on just making money begin to question what is the meaning of life why am i doing that
6264069 i know one or two members of the congregation who are going through difficult times or redundancies themselves so its a great support for them
6264070 from a biblical perspective you realise there is a higher authority despite the economic uncertainty of today
6264071 ive been in the financial industry for more than 20 years and the pressure on employees has increased probably every year
6264072 there are a lot of christians in the wharf more than youd think in what many see as a temple of mammon
6264073 we are all trying in a way to gain the whole world thats the nature of banking and finance but as the bible says dont forget your soul at the same time
6264074 the benefits of unified communications are clear you communicate more efficiently stay in closer contact with customers and key members of your organization and hopefully sell more products but enterprises must take the time to measure the gains in productivity that a uc deployment brings to the table
6264075 by blending presence im voice and video with one another and increasingly with service oriented architectures soas do you buy that
6264076 are you getting ready to manage unified communications because your next microsoft office upgrade will enable uc for everyone using outlook
6264077 its a no brainer because you need economies of scale to assemble the mature data center management talent process and tools required

6264081 human blood is the life line of islam violence its hallmark and gt gt hate its foundation in the beginning islam lives on the blood of gt gt infidels when that is unavailable or becomes difficult islam must gt gt cannibalize itself
6264082 like children playing with dynamite western intellectuals gt gt journalists and diplomats fantasize that they are achieving results gt gt in the middle east with their words promises apologies money and gt gt concessions yet how can such innocents cope with polities and gt gt societies whose basic ruling ethos is that of the serial killer can gt gt anyone really expect a stable society capable of progress in pakistan gt gt when a large majority of the population expresses admiration for usama gt gt bin ladin and what about the saudi system where as one local writer gt gt put it the big usama put into practice what the little usama learned gt gt in a saudi school the radical forces in the region are not expecting gt gt to retain or gain power by negotiating compromising or being better gt gt understood they believe they are going to shoot their way into power gt gt or just as good accept the surrender of those they have intimidated gt gt that is why so much of the western analysis and strategies for dealing gt gt with the region are a bad joke
6264083 europe is being targeted for deliberate colonization by muslim gt gt states and with coordinated efforts aimed at our islamization and the gt gt elimination of our freedoms we are being subject to a foreign gt gt invasion and aiding and abetting a foreign invasion in any way gt gt constitutes treason if non europeans have the right to resist gt gt colonization and desire self determination then europeans have that gt gt right too and we intend to exercise it
6264084 there does not exist an identifiable body of muslims substantive in

6264086 muslims who share the same goals as osama bin laden but are pursuing gt gt them through non violent means are celebrated by gullible westerners gt gt as moderates

6264090 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6264091 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6264092 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6264093 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6264094 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet
6264095 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty
6264096 it is a very important document for the u s and india
6264097 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6264098 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view
6264099 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6264100 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6264101 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6264102 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6264103 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6264104 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6264105 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and had no family relationship with any other sibling
6264106 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and had no family relationship with any other sibling
6264107 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and had no family relationship with any other sibling
6264108 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6264109 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6264110 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6264111 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs
6264112 teenage cancer trust has been working in partnership with the nhs to develop specialist hospital units which are significantly improving outcomes for young patients but 60 of teenagers still dont have access to a teenage cancer trust unit
6264113 one could barely turn on the television without hearing that the new iphone 3g was twice as fast for half the price
6264114 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6264115 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6264116 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6264117 damage to nxp is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings
6264118 this was a short term study without placebo so it shows that a longer term trial should be done
6264119 we are planning a larger long term study that will be international in the united states and canada and also in europe
6264120 we selected the best ones did chemistry to modify them and came up with ptc124
6264121 a shareholder approached me and he told me i dont care about your cause all i care about is the money in my pocket
6264122 we are paying on the order of 10 12m just in salaries for people in the local community and guatemala in general
6264123 its very worrisome for us because here in guatemala the social fabric is very fragmented
6264124 i tied a rock to the rope and i slung the rope across
6264125 the company didnt ask for my permission they just stuck it there
6264126 fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse
6264127 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6264128 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6264129 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6264130 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6264131 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6264132 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6264133 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6264134 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6264135 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6264136 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6264137 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6264138 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6264139 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6264140 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6264141 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6264142 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6264143 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6264144 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6264145 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6264146 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6264147 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6264148 they want to know what were going to do about it
6264149 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6264150 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6264151 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6264152 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6264153 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6264154 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6264155 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6264156 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6264157 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6264158 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6264159 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6264160 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6264161 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6264162 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6264163 ticky tacky little houses and they all look just the same
6264164 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver

6264176 im lucky to have such a great job and dont think of myself as a hero but i look around this room and see how many heroes there really are in lombard as was so evident in december
6264177 i felt from what i was hearing that there was an incredible amount of personal attention being given to my mother and me
6264178 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6264179 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too

6264184 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6264185 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6264186 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6264187 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6264188 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6264189 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6264190 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6264191 thanks for the connection i hope that in 20 years connections via social networks or what every they are called then are more automatic such as registering a connection when we shake hands like we did at asm ive really tried to keep track of people i connect with for the last 20 years with increasing degrees of sophistication i sense that the next 20 will bring a flood of improvements we havent even thought of yet
6264192 if this was a joke it was very methodical and thought out
6264193 he was involved in a similar hoax a few years back
6264194 it started off as some youtube videos and a web site
6264195 zum teufel wo steckst du du solltest doch an der br cke sein
6264196 weve now learned that the path of globalization runs in both directions
6264197 im reading all this b s that theres going to be an exodus the nbas not going to lose any great players
6264198 i think it benefits the nba in the long run that europe is interested in these young players and is willing to pay them
6264199 if this plan for globalization of the nba comes to pass there are already players over there
6264200 great basketball is great basketball whether its america europe or asia
6264201 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down
6264202 theyve got horns whistles and fires up in the stands they throw coins and lighters its great competition i just cant see these superstars doing it
6264203 first of all i think kobe and lebron have too much time on their hands
6264204 these guys want to be the best players in the world
6264205 i think that the players championship and the fedexcup have enough credibility to where it can offset a season if you were to do well in those events and not win a major
6264206 anybody that plays well in the fedexcup and wins the fedexcup i think that would ease anything if they didnt play well in the majors
6264207 i feel ive been playing some pretty good golf i havent taken it to that last level of winning but ive been just below
6264208 we as a family know they are going to be difficult because we play five of them and they are stressful the kids start school in the middle of this to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor

6264220 number of progressive positions over the years with respect to drug policy
6264221 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
6264222 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6264223 imagine for a moment a doctor that has a patient with a serious but treatable case of cancer would it be ethical for that doctor to automatically give that woman morphine and otherwise make her comfortable until she died of her disease rather than offering the patient an attempt at treatment and a chance at recovery
6264224 would you want to live next to one of these
6264225 crafted to undermine roe v wade or pre existing illinois state law regulating reproductive healthcare and medical practice which is why senator obama objected to them

6264228 i lose a child that i was so prepared for and for something i could have avoided
6264229 i would not have taken the drugs i would not have breastfed and taken the drug
6264230 i dont think there is a reason to be scared but there is a reason to be informed
6264231 i dont think people should be scared but like many other drugs women and doctors should be aware that something we thought was safe may not be safe
6264232 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6264233 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6264234 the child pornography is a little bit of a bump in the road
6264235 i cant take it back if i could i would in a heartbeat
6264236 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same

6264238 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain senator mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6264239 what he refused to do on behalf of the democratic ticket
6264240 now willing to do on behalf of the republican party
6264241 hes going to iraq but hes already decided his position hes not going to listen to general david petraeus hes not going to listen to our troops i think thats not the kind of leadership we need in the oval office
6264242 senator lieberman has always been there for senator reid even on close votes except for iraq
6264243 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6264244 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6264245 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6264246 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work

6264257 reaffirmed the importance of the fiji interim government honoring the undertakings it made to forum leaders in 2007 to return fiji to democracy by holding an election by march 2009 and to accept the outcomes of that election
6264258 the national farmers federation appears to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and opposition spokesman on foreign affairs andrew robb rowing in the exact opposition direction
6264259 i think its time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether theyve got any policy on this
6264260 all i know is farmers organisations are saying to us ever since we came to government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6264261 this is their practical proposal and weve responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years
6264262 were concerned to know about health checks security checks compliance how we make sure theyre going to go back all of the issues you would expect that surround what is a significant and arguably the most significant change in immigration policy weve had in a generation in australia
6264263 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6264264 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6264265 but i think what brendan is referring to is the checks and balances that go on people coming into the country
6264266 we dont want to for instance import the crime problem of port moresby into australia weve got to make sure the checks and balances are correct
6264267 there was a concern of this sort of image of bringing in labour which is essentially of course to be frank about it non white labour to do jobs that people in australia simply didnt want to do
6264268 they didnt want to have a system in australia where you have a second tier of people who come to our country
6264269 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6264270 if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
6264271 but they need to change the order in which its participated on that particular day so that he would have more than 27 minutes of rest
6264272 they dont know how to be hosts they have so much to learn its not like central or south america
6264273 they canadian fans dont know what it means to put pressure on opponents

6264276 a symphony must be like the world it must embrace everything
6264277 came to believe in self expression and originality above all else a symphony was no longer an aristocratic amusement but a multifaceted musical statement an instrumental genre operatic in its degree of contrast conflict and resolution
6264278 philosophical tracts spiritual musings musical reflections on the great unanswered questions
6264279 a model for what the new post stalin soviet music might aspire to be a more personally expressive less explicitly programmatic work one that both engaged and challenged its listeners
6264280 beethoven possessed a unique gift for communication he radiated an absolute directness that makes his music totally accessible the sheer emotional power of his music is readily understood his revolutionary compositional ideas are easily appreciated
6264281 and his nine symphonies are among the greatest achievements of the human spirit
6264282 they were revolutionary on every level harmonic melodic rhythmic formal dramatic self expressive and emotional beethoven led the charge to a totally new era he threw out the restraint of 18th century classicism and ushered in romantic self expression his symphonic offspring were the first statesmen of this new musical democracy
6264283 yeah i didnt really want him to go there but its not like i could stop him

6264289 we did i think a good job with the wii last year but were doing a great job this year because this is where the casual audience is the mass audience is here its a great control system but youve got to learn to use it
6264290 i think the biggest learning we had this year is that you port your controls up as opposed to down
6264291 we lived where somehow l2 means hit someone on the head
6264292 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
6264293 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
6264294 the refreshing new visual style bold art direction and visceral gameplay of the house of dead overkill truly makes it standout on the wii
6264295 sega is committed to delivering unique gameplay experiences and the house of the dead overkill certainly qualifies as one of our most innovative sega games coming to the wii
6264296 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6264297 im not a type of person who will make other people cry or suffer in any situation
6264298 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6264299 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6264300 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6264301 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6264302 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6264303 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6264304 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture u s agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6264305 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6264306 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6264307 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done
6264308 a productive society that can govern and provide services to its people as well as develop a gross national product
6264309 that does not come overnight thats an institutional change that will take some time
6264310 we want all our personnel to know that health and security are the companys highest priorities
6264311 we are working with the algerian authorities to ensure the safety of our staff
6264312 he urges once again that the international community support the efforts of the government of algeria to combat terrorism
6264313 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6264314 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6264315 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6264316 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6264317 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6264318 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6264319 fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away

6264329 no bar nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like apple soho has
6264330 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6264331 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6264332 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6264333 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment
6264334 apple employees during their breaks lounging eating smoking littering in effect trespassing on nearby peoples stoops

6264443 at the first stage we will set up eight outposts less than a battalion 272 men and later a second line of outposts already along the administrative border of ossetia which of course need to be equipped from the point of view of engineering and be prepared for providing support to peacekeepers
6264444 last night was the noisiest night in gori since the bombing ended
6264445 aside from the vehicles moving you could hear fire from automatic weapons and patrolling was intensified they were patrolling in vehicles as well as on foot i suppose they might have been trying to secure their flanks in anticipation of a withdrawal
6264446 we already started leaving a long time ago those russian forces in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali theyre already going back we forces in the gori area entered first so we have to be last to go weve abolished quite a few checkpoints
6264447 a great friend of afghanistan and a man of great principles
6264448 this detachment was involved in a big ambush by a group of about 100 insurgents
6264449 the combat was fierce and intense fighting and lasted several hours continuing late into the night
6264450 my office considers carefully all information relating to alleged crimes within its jurisdiction war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide committed on the territory of states parties or by nationals of states parties regardless of the individuals or groups alleged to have committed the crimes
6264451 the office will proceed to seek further information from all actors concerned
6264452 weve got to stay physical and weve got to run the ball
6264453 weve just got to keep making that investment and just keep hammering in there
6264454 were a track team out there we have to tackle when were supposed to tackle and hammer the run when were supposed to
6264455 we call on russia to again implement the cease fire pull its troops out of georgia all of them that came in after august 6 and make sure this humanitarian crisis is averted and immediately take steps to stop the humanitarian and human rights violations that were receiving credible reports on
6264456 we have to do all we can to save the georgian democracy save democracy in georgia that means tackling the humanitarian crisis it also means making sure the economy restores growth and that the financial system remains stable
6264457 so theres a lot we need to do to make sure georgian democracy stays on track
6264458 were not trying to issue vague empty threats or wag our finger
6264459 were simply stating the fact that this military operation has imposed a serious cost on russia in terms of its standing in the world and thats not a good thing its not something we relish its not something we want to see happen
6264460 president sarkozy and other french authorities have repeatedly requested russia to abide by this commitment of withdrawing their forces
6264461 we have done it repeatedly over the last days and so far we have not seen anything that points to any credible sign of withdrawal of russian forces and that is why today we decided to seize the security council to press upon the parties and press upon russia in particular that these commitments the commitments they have entered to have to be respected
6264462 whatever the final outcome of these discussions one thing is clear now south ossetia and abkhazia lie within georgias internationally recognized borders
6264463 only yesterday august 18 the united kingdoms defense attache to georgia was turned back from a russian checkpoint in georgia and told he required a russian visa in order to proceed further do foreigners need now russian visas to travel within georgia
6264464 its hard to see how russian actions are consistent with russias claim justification for their military assault namely the protection of its peacekeepers and civilians in south ossetia and abkhazia even though most of those civilians have only recently been handed russian passports and havent lived in russia
6264465 the position of the russian federation is crystal clear and regrettably the position of some of the councils members is not anymore a secret to anyone
6264466 this is by far a nonconstructive position and may be a position with a double or even triple bottom meaning
6264467 to achieve this we need i think the whole international community needs the support of the security council which has to produce an appropriate resolution supporting these six points
6264468 not to join any al qaeda organization outside of iraq
6264469 the existence of abkhazia and georgia in one state is impossible
6264470 abkhazia has existed as an independent state for 15 years and it has all the necessary traits of an independent state
6264471 we have a viable government our economy is developing all the attributes of state power have been created there is a legitimate opposition and an independent press
6264472 a customary form of expression of the will of the people here in abkhazia in view of recent events in south ossetia and abkhazia the people of abkhazia will once again try to express their opinion
6264473 if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president
6264474 on the question of the probability that russia will go ahead and acknowledge abkhazia as an independent state i think thats highly unlikely
6264475 the duma and or the federation council will meet next week and discuss the issue
6264476 the situation in georgia would die down the attention of the international community would be distracted elsewhere and that would give medvedev and his buddies time to plot how and when and if they will actually go ahead and recognize independence
6264477 the russian armed forces act strictly in accordance with the international agreements and continue the withdrawal of troops to places of previous deployment
6264478 we consider such peacemaking on the part of nato when the aggressor which was earlier abundantly armed is being restored a clear factor provoking a new blitzkrieg
6264479 if the zone is under peacekeepers control nobody else should fly there
6264480 the number of those killed has been revised downward from 74 as announced on august 10 to 64
6264481 were going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal
6264482 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states
6264483 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
6264484 a senseless way giving kazakhstan some territories that historically were parts of russia
6264485 i will show you mine if you show me yours
6264486 the russian federation will not be able to support the draft resolution of the security council submitted by france today the representative of france has just referred to two elements in the peace plan there are six principles which were proclaimed by the presidents of france and russia
6264487 whatever the reasons the russia federation claims it had to enter georgia it is abundantly clear today on august 19th that it has no business being in georgia anymore and needs to leave
6264488 our position is that we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6264489 in principle yes we have not yet thought about it
6264490 on this issue we fully support russia the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6264491 we oppose all these attempts as we think that this is a continuation of u s cold war era policy what russia has done is to defend its legitimate interests
6264492 georgia started the crisis but the west is blaming russia everywhere there is total disinformation distortion of facts and international attempts to isolate russia
6264493 the resolution of the important problems in central asia the caucasus and europe is impossible without russia i think that after the crisis with georgia russia has become only stronger
6264494 the parties have acted pragmatically there are no plans to wreck our cooperation
6264495 it is essential to tone down the rhetoric and think about what needs to be preserved in russia nato cooperation and what needs to be abandoned
6264496 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
6264497 is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6264498 dictated by a drive that can only be called anti russian aimed at supporting an aggressive regime
6264499 the coaches saw that if we got a certain coverage we wanted to check to that play
6264500 we checked to that play and they really had a great coverage for what we tried to run
6264501 weve got to stay physical and weve got to run the ball
6264502 weve just got to keep making that investment and just keep hammering in there
6264503 its the preseason everybodys trying to work out their kinks
6264504 as time goes on things will start to clear up its kind of new for everybody trying to see what works what doesnt work we just hike the ball and run
6264505 davin is the kind of guy that might take the boot off and play knowing him
6264506 so im not going to discount him playing in the opener or the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville theres a chance he might not be ready for a couple weeks
6264507 im not happy with it to be honest with you
6264508 im sick for davin joseph hes one of the ringleaders on this football team so im disappointed im hurt for him im also confident that we have the stuff to pick up the slack while hes getting himself ready to play obviously its a tough blow for us here at this time but its also very exciting for somebody to step up
6264509 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6264510 obviously jeremy zuttah will be a factor at that position dan buenning has experience playing guard there are the possibilities of adding a player here or there so i dont want to say too much right now at this point were confident in the guys we have
6264511 it is an agreement that deepens the defense cooperation between poland and the united states
6264512 it does so of course in the context of our great alliance with nato and our article 5 commitments to one another in that alliance
6264513 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6264514 we are integrating land maritime air special forces operations and selected interagency organizations in a realistic and challenging training environment
6264515 everything you will see in this exercise emphasizes and focuses on the multinational
6264516 we are a region that works together as a coalition it is not the u s it is not nato it is the coalition of our region and we take a regional approach to everything thats one of the underlying themes of this exercise
6264517 in the event of a real world situation requiring a multinational effort the groundwork were laying here will be invaluable
6264518 the panama canal is a great template for us to work on because every country has an interest in it because it is so critical to commerce
6264519 this is what we should be doing around the world all the time in every region that we are in working collaboratively in a cooperative security environment
6264520 that is probably the greatest deterrent we can have building relationships with countries around the world
6264521 so i think that is one of the bedrocks of this panamax
6264522 that is why this exercise is such an extraordinary training opportunity in my mind it is all about engagement with the other nations
6264523 that is an important message and everybody is doing extraordinarily well
6264524 this is a chance for these partners to work together not only to participate but to be the leadership

6264614 de commissie oosting heeft geconstateerd dat de brandweermensen voorafgaand aan de inzet geen inzicht hadden in de aard van het risico object door de afwezigheid van een aanvalsplan of bevelvoederskaart voor het bedrijf wisten de brandweerlieden niet wat er in termen van gevarenklasse bij s e fireworks lag opgeslagen en zij beschikten niet over informatie over eventuele op het terrein preventieve voorzieningen
6264615 als er door de brandweer gewerkt was volgens het aanvalsplan dan had een ramp voorkomen kunnen worden ik hoop vanuit de grond van mijn hart dat de werkelijke toedracht van de vuurwerkramp ooit opgehelderd wordt

6264620 internet is ook een vergankelijk medium op het moment van schrijven van dit slotdocument meer dan 5 5 jaar na de ramp is door het uitvallen van sites met betrouwbare content en de opkomst van sites met een sterke complotachtergrond internet een onbetrouwbare nieuwsbron en zelfs giftig voor mensen die informatie over de ramp zoeken een betrouwbare content rijke rampsite moet dan ook vele jaren blijven bestaan en fungeren als gemeenschappelijke geheugen voor gebeurtenissen en het vooral ook overzicht daarvan het ontbreken van een goed overzicht draagt ook bij aan ongelukjes in de massamedia journalisten die de ramp uitgebreid hebben gevolgd gaan naar een ander project en nieuwkomers ori nteren zich mede op basis van giftige informatie spookverhalen en aperte onzin worden tot nieuws gemaakt met alle schadelijke gevolgen voor de getroffenen

6264687 a gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar on top
6264688 the commodity funds and funds out of the us have been investing heavily into precious metal markets there too and as the price of gold has risen so it gets more and more into the media and investors look at it as an alternative

6264699 membership decline is revealing our growing awareness and discontent with the fact that we often lack spiritual vitality creativity vision and direction
6264700 a vast number of people in the diocese ignore what happens on a diocesan level except when they are upset about something because they have neither time nor energy to focus on anything outside their congregations or daily lives

6264748 15th reconnaissance squadron personnel have been involved with every major operation in oif and oef since the inception of combat operations

6264750 they provide critical isr intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance to ground commanders enable the tracking capture and death of enemy insurgents and provide life saving overwatch to coalition forces
6264751 technology today is allowing us to take aviation capabilities to new levels and the predator is a perfect example of how uas support is making a difference in the fight

6264754 this milestone only serves to illustrate the 432nd wings absolute obligation to our ground forces
6264755 400 000 flight hours is a huge number and it takes thousands of men and women here at creech and our air national guard partners at their bases grinding it out to continue to fight over iraq and afghanistan every hour of every day
6264756 it takes great skill to operate the most persistent strike intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platform in the world
6264757 the men and women of the 432nd wing have proved time and again that they are the most qualified for the job which is why the predator remains one of the most sought after assets in the war on terrorism
6264758 while its an honor to be a part of such a historic event this is only one of many more uas milestones to come

6264847 over recent months the board has received a number of comments on the no surcharge and no steering rules that apply to payments using the paypal system as well as the mandated acceptance of paypal on ebays auction site
6264848 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
6264849 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules
6264850 this is a significant step towards returning freedom of choice to both sellers and buyers and allowing hundreds of thousands of australian sellers who refused to sign up and offer paypal by 21 may 2008 and have thus been unable to sell on ebay since then to return
6264851 since launching in early 2005 paypal has always had on going dialogue with australias regulators and governing bodies and will continue to do so

6264856 as many of these services are directed at the younger less experienced consumer the accc is particularly concerned over what it considers is the failure of certain advertisements to adequately disclose the costs and ongoing nature of the services offered

6264867 my goal in writing this book is to encourage well meaning white people to reconsider their ideas about racism the title
6264868 the ideas presented in this book emerged from within a sociological paradigm that regards racism in the united states as a societal phenomenon that began with slavery was sustained throughout the reconstruction period and persists today in the institutions of society
6264869 whites in the racist category are defined as disliking or hating blacks and other minorities and their animosity is portrayed in acts or statements that are blatantly racist
6264870 unlike symbolic racism which is linked to conservative politics aversive racism self denial of racist thoughts is closely related to self proclaimed liberals aversive racism and silent racism are related in that the tendency to avoid mentioning race is acknowledged by several of the participants in this study
6264871 only white people who are clear about the historical legacy of racism in the united states who understand how institutional racism operates and who sense their own complicity with a system that benefits them to the detriment of people of color are likely to be active in interrupting racism when they encounter it
6264872 this is the biological purpose of every mind human as well as animal and moreover it is its only purpose the brains purpose is to direct our external behavior in a way that maximizes our evolutionary success thats it given this it is remarkable that the human mind is good at solving any problems whatsoever beyond who should i mate with what is that guy up to how can i help my kid or where are the antelopes hanging out at this time of year there is nothing in the biological specifications for brain building that calls for a device capable of high powered reasoning or of solving abstract problems or even of providing an accurate picture of the outside world beyond what is needed to enable its possessors to thrive and reproduce
6264873 this chapter begins with the sociological concept of institutional racism including the effects it produces and the theories that have developed around it several of the theories imply the role of actors people who take action however none bridges the micro macro gap satisfactorily in other words none of the theories explains how the action of individuals produces societal patterns of racial inequality i will present a theory of institutional racism that forges a link between social institutions and the actors who sustain them the theory also explains how institutional racism is carried out largely by people who have no intention to produce it
6264874 i nstitutional racism as a concept has been expanded to include the role of cultural beliefs as integral to the process despite these changes sociology has been slow to explain the role of actors involved in the production and maintenance of institutional racism a breakthrough in sociological race theory institutional racism has remained a compelling macrolevel concept primarily because it demonstrates the important idea that racism permeates society through its institutions that is the concept reveals that racism is systemic in accomplishing this institutional racism illustrates that racism is more than the prejudice of individuals the difficulty however is that the concept implicitly disconnects individuals from institutions this false separation results in institutional racism being undertheorized in terms of the mechanism through which institutions produce racial inequality
6264875 the criminal justice system education and the economy put people of color at a disadvantage
6264876 i nstitutional racism is not limited to disadvantages that accrue to blacks and other minorities it also includes the miseducation of white children which teaches that racial equality has been achieved despite gross evidence to the contrary
6264877 the one consistent finding is that black white interaction between equals is associated with positive attitudes about blacks among whites although not always with positive attitudes about whites among blacks
6264878 the danger in the case of white women working together on their racism is the possibility that someone might begin to think for example that a statement like vanessas about iq and racial difference has merit or that katies question about black americans going back to africa might be a viable solution to the problem of racism in the united states whether or not these dangers outweigh the value of all white group work is unclear
6264879 opponents cast government policies that level the playing field as reverse racism a color blind view that denies both the effect of structures slavery segregation and institutional racism on blacks and the effect of racial ideology on whites institutional racism and the racist ideology operate to the advantage of whites and the disadvantage of blacks and they operate in tandem to ignore either is to distort how racism is produced
6264880 we want all our personnel to know that health and security are the companys highest priorities
6264881 we are working with the algerian authorities to ensure the safety of our staff
6264882 he urges once again that the international community support the efforts of the government of algeria to combat terrorism
6264883 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6264884 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6264885 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6264886 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6264887 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6264888 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6264889 were looking at glasgow we are interested in glasgow what we will be doing is taking a close look at the financial situation at glasgow and at what we could bring to the airport
6264890 these are vital components of scotlands national infrastructure and a publicly owned non profit model could have major environmental and economic benefits
6264891 we remain of the view that glasgow and edinburgh airports serve separate markets and that competition between the two is highly unlikely regardless of ownership this is a view shared by many of scotlands leading business organisations
6264892 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6264893 in scotland we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6264894 baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability
6264895 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6264896 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6264897 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6264898 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6264899 to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6264900 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud
6264901 i have been a successful businessman in my life i have had the porsche the gold rolex watch and a home in chelsea now all i want to do is help the community
6264902 i know the jury and i and anyone else listening to this case would have been appalled at the cavalier way in which the taxpayers money was dealt with by the kensington and chelsea primary care trust
6264903 the fraud was allowed to continue with the result a large sum of public money designated for health care was lost
6264904 rob and terri are unique people in the business world in general and without equal in the largely treacherous mortgage industry i recommend the mortgage insiders and the mortgage advantage without qualification

6264909 well as far as a majority the congregation is concerned he is no longer a member of this church
6264910 and so we said enough is enough were not leaving this church holloway has to leave and you notice that i call him holloway because i cant call him pastor anymore
6264911 he was the first pastor called to preach at this church and he has just for lack of a better word just raped the people
6264912 he sold that property after the church met and said we dont want you to sell that property dont sell it time and time again dont sell it he sold it anyway
6264913 judge williams you can speak to him back there on my behalf please
6264914 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war

6264926 we just immediately hit it off its as if wed known each other all our lives hes like my little brother
6264927 back then keith was looking for influences and inspiration and he got a great deal of it from la iis work
6264928 keith treated him as a true collaborator he didnt treat him like some little kid which he actually was really he respected him and gave him half of whatever they collaborated on

6264942 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6264943 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6264944 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6264945 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6264946 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6264947 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6264948 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6264949 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6264950 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6264951 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6264952 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6265102 i think that two factors came together the physical and the mental i train every day with the same dedication and the same interest in addition i have the support of my family my wife and my parents who have given me the strength to carry on even when things have not gone well for me i have had two good trainers physical conditioner felipe diez sir and orestes kindel n who have helped me find the form and corrected my errors
6265103 basically yes i always try to sweep home and not do a long swing i also make adjustments because it is not the same thing facing a pitcher who throws 90 miles or more in that case i stand in the rear of the box than one who bases his pitching on breaking balls very difficult because the batter always tends to go out front and to take his hips and shoulders out before it is time that helped me a lot in this competition where one has to face pitchers who are very different
6265104 well in the first place i found out that i was the top batter after the first two hits against china when higinio v lez went to the press box and started to ask about the statistics

6265260 his job was to get into the final not to come fifth and not make it through

6265269 i sweat like this after most 5ks so its hard to tell if the heat was a factor i didnt notice it during the race it wasnt overpowering
6265270 i drew a bit of a short straw with the heats with an olympic champion and multiple world championship medallist so i had to go out and give it a go as one of the fastest qualifiers
6265271 but like the rest of the team i got a virus a few days ago ive been in bed for three days until yesterday that just hit me with 300m to go i was feeling good but couldnt finish it off

6265328 we are paying on the order of 10 12m just in salaries for people in the local community and guatemala in general
6265329 its very worrisome for us because here in guatemala the social fabric is very fragmented
6265330 i tied a rock to the rope and i slung the rope across
6265331 the company didnt ask for my permission they just stuck it there
6265332 the theme of digital vs anti digital represents the evolution of the digital industry clients and creatives are moving away from can we do this technically to should we do this for the brand digital design today is more joined up more integrated and more about brand behavior than bits and bytes what a great time to be a part of this industry

6265341 zoals we bij de publicatie van de q1 cijfers al aankondigden voert het iab op dit moment nauw overleg met participerende exploitanten en nielsen media research om tot een verbeterde registratiemethodiek te komen na een eerste inventarisatieronde zijn we nu bezig om exacte definities op te stellen van de nieuwe indeling in afrekenmodellen kanalen en uitingsvormen in samenhang met een nieuwe procesbeschrijving voor aanlevering verwerking en rapportage ook die zullen we toetsen aan de huidige participanten en het ziet er nog altijd naar uit dat we de nieuwe methodiek nog in 2008 zullen lanceren los daarvan is dit cijfer van 15 7 natuurlijk bevredigend alleen al omdat het flink hoger is dan de 12 procent over heel 2007 en het zorgt voor een gezonde balans ten opzichte van het groeipercentage van 8 van het eerste kwartaal dit jaar

6265348 this is shameful and it has already imposed difficult hardship on californians across our state
6265349 im willing to compromise on the temporary one cent increase in the sales tax
6265350 we fundamentally believe it will make california a worse place if you do taxes its not because were somehow dug in ideologically
6265351 hes in the wrong party i guess they think hes a democrat hes not a closed deal with us so hes really out there on an ice float by himself
6265352 im upset hes not a team player and i think our state can only function if we are all part of one team

6265358 ive spent some time with family and friends but mostly ive been training valencia is a grand prix ive been looking forward to as its not only a new circuit but a new street circuit
6265359 from what ive seen and read about it i think itll be a great track to race on so i cant wait for the weekend to start
6265360 the atmosphere will no doubt be fantastic as well because the spanish have a real passion for formula one valencia should be a track that suits our car so im hoping well have a good race and take something positive away from spain
6265361 the best site on the world wide web although she could cut some of that crazy music she listens to

6265364 something that will thrill the ghoul in me give me the same kind of feeling as when i see a horrible car crash and slow down to gawp or that really great sadness i felt when princess di died something i can have a good old wallow in something tragic like that
6265365 they were very interested in how we went about the selection process
6265366 we did not have to provide as much breadth or depth on our practice
6265367 it was more focused on how we were uniquely positioned to serve as national counsel
6265368 we wanted them to know that the firm was behind the idea and willing to discuss creative billing proposals
6265369 a desire to enhance pfizers relationship with its outside counsel find a new way to do business with law firms other than to be charged by the hour and to obtain the ability to have budget certainty on a year to year basis
6265370 without bringing the entire firm we wanted to make sure pfizer knew we were dedicated to the process
6265371 the biggest part of the decision was the trust factor
6265372 we were putting all of our eggs in one basket before we had a choice among ten firms making this decision meant that choice was gone
6265373 jackson lewis got it because they recognized that we needed to find some alternative to billing by the hour they actually brought it up before we did
6265374 its made the management part of my job much more streamlined
6265375 i just have to read one e mail to get all my budget updates and status reports
6265376 on all counts we have accomplished our goals and look forward to continuing our momentum into the future
6265377 because the work we give out to firms is not relationship driven
6265378 it wasnt possible to identify which firms were truly invested in pfizer
6265379 its not just because im here and new but more because its three years old and is due for a review
6265380 weve got a whole laundry list of things they cant charge us for
6265381 actually i was talking about a management conference for execs who work for trade business
6265382 consumer groups theyre associations too should be included in that conference it would provide
6265383 thanks for a great post i sent this link to our local membership staff retention is especially
6265384 thank you for these colorful updates as an association exec who doesnt have the funds to attend
6265385 as far as were concerned the plaintiffs are just using their legal muscle to get us to pay for alterations to the house after the fact
6265386 we wouldnt have brought the case unless there was some detail for it
6265387 a buildup of moisture and flooding mold and mildew problems in the basement
6265388 they alleged a problem with drainage under the deck and before we had time to fix it they ripped out the whole deck
6265389 he could turn around today and sell it for more than its worth
6265390 case law from new jersey and other jurisdictions involving the videotaping of oral examinations makes clear that videotaping has become an acceptable method of creating a deposition record and is widely embraced by the legal profession
6265391 was a blatant attempt to limit what and how i conduct my discovery deposition which is clearly not the purpose of this rule
6265392 simply because defense counsel is somewhat camera shy and or uncomfortable about the prospect of questioning plaintiff before a video camera
6265393 there is a gap between the data and the opinion he proffers
6265394 youre going to have a hard time convincing me that he abused his discretion
6265395 this was a decision not about methodology but the ultimate issue of causation
6265396 the mechanism by which accutane can affect and cure acne is unknown
6265397 they are now asking you to reward them for doing none of this testing
6265398 he was hired to be an expert for you in this case
6265399 studies have reported the development of inflammatory bowel disease with accutane use
6265400 they dont know how to be hosts they have so much to learn its not like central or south america
6265401 they canadian fans dont know what it means to put pressure on opponents
6265402 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6265403 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6265404 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6265405 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phony here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6265406 going to find myself im going to write a book kids book and just try to get my life together
6265407 there are so many people out there who dislike him its safer for him to stay in jail
6265408 if we could but stand on this earth as upon a mere shadow and live as those who will soon be done with this poor transient life if we held every earthly thing with a very loose hand we would not be caring and worrying and fretting but we would be praying for thus we grasp the real the substantial and plant our feet upon the invisible which is after all the eternal let the text drop into your heart as a pebble falls into a mountain lake and as it enters let it make rings of comfort upon the very surface of your soul
6265409 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made know unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus

6265412 a florida man used facilities at the university of miami to run a multimillion dollar ponzi scheme and recruited school employees for the operation angry investors and investigators tell cnn andres pimstein a um business school graduate has confessed to operating the scheme in which some investors were promised returns of 18 percent miami dade county police said people across the country lost an estimated 30 million in the scheme which collapsed this year said wayne black a miami private investigator hired by one investor
6265413 pimstein had a joint bank account with the universitys director of contract administration alan weber according to bank records
6265414 it was about making money and then it turned into pimstein being the center of attention
6265415 him being important to these people that were friends he played baseball with them he knows their kids in some cases
6265416 several investment groups besides the one at um were set up and those groups recruited new investors black said
6265417 he or she got points got a percentage off the top of all their investors so they would solicit more investors
6265418 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6265419 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6265420 im not sure where the advice is coming on this
6265421 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6265422 either you are going to allow fruit to rot on the vine in australian fruit growing areas or you are going to do something about practical about it
6265423 kay hulls i presume there for the national party and the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position
6265424 yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing exactly in the opposite direction
6265425 it is time the liberal and the national party the opposition sort out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6265426 that is a question best put to mr nelson and mr robb
6265427 we are going to have a good discussion today about fiji about climate change and about the big challenges for development in the region against the millennium development goals
6265428 as i said before the region has got huge challenges ahead of it and our job is to be long term positive partners with region not just in investing in the region but measuring improvements as well

6265458 ik word de laatste tijd een beetje naar van confessionele politici als ab en zijn brother in crime hirsch ballin waarom ingaan tegen mensen die daadwerkelijk verstand van zaken hebben zoals prof dr f a de wolff emeritus hoogleraar klinische en forensische toxicologie te leiden die stelt namelijk het volgende het verbieden van paddos zal de volksgezondheid geen goed doen de werkelijke toxicologische bedreigingen voor de volksgezondheid zijn alcohol en tabak met hun sterk verslavende werking de strijd tegen overmatig gebruik hiervan heeft een veel hogere prioriteit dan een paddoverbod zouden de confessionelen zich dan toch beroepen op de bijbel in politieke kwesties neem nu dat andere charismatische wonder der nederlandse politiek hirsch ballin die begin deze maand een brief heeft geschreven aan de kamer waarin hij pleit voor het strafbaar stellen van het beledigen van god kan ik meneer ballin ook aanklagen omdat hij mij beledigt door zijn middeleeuwse uitspraken wanneer hij zijn brief had voorgedragen op het concilie van reims in 1157 waar een eerste stap werd gezet ter oprichting van de inquisitie teneinde ketterijen te verwijderen uit de samenleving dan had dit een staande ovatie tot gevolg gehad nu valt hoongelach hem ten deel wellicht is het beter als ik een amateuristisch tekeningetje maak waarin ik hem een nekschot geef dan mag ik me waarschijnlijk komen verantwoorden voor de rechtbank in een vrije samenleving kunnen verschillende meningen beledigend zijn de overheid moet het niet als taak zien te bepalen wat wel en wat niet beledigend is dat beperkt de vrijheid het verbod op discriminatie biedt volgens onze hirsch te weinig bescherming kolder vrijheid van meningsuiting is het grootste goed van een vrije samenleving men heeft mijns inziens daarom het recht anderen te beledigen daarmee ben ik geen voorstander van het beledigen van anderen maar de koppige houding van de confessionelen met betrekking tot het strafbaar stellen van belediging is ridicuul minister donner probeerde dit al na de moord op theo van gogh maar een kamermeerderheid voorkwam dit gelukkig zijn er nu ook nog verstandige partijen die de christelijke plannetjes van de moderne inquisitie zullen tegenhouden het is nu echter wel duidelijk geworden dat de christenunie en het cda meer belang hechten aan hun christelijke waarden en normen dan aan de vrije samenleving dat is een trieste zaak voor de nederlandse politiek
6265459 waarom kunnen gelovigen hun geloof toch zo moeilijk bij zichzelf houden
6265460 currently theres a huge amount of interest in silver bullion
6265461 about a month ago when gold started hitting some of its highs silver went crazy i would say 14 out of 15 inquiries at the moment are in relation to purchasing silver bullion
6265462 you still have everyone wanting to buy it and no one wanting to sell it thats very positive for investors to see that interest
6265463 people purchase gold and silver as a hedge against inflation and economies collapsing so we encourage people to actually have possession of it
6265464 an ounce of gold is about a 10 or 20 piece
6265465 i would expect that ratio to gravitate towards a ratio of 15 1 as this precious metals bull market matures
6265466 but its really something you would be more likely to use as a way to spend money
6265467 ones net worth can be stored in silver its more exchangeable than gold so its a lower barrier to entry for the average investor to begin
6265468 has uses in the real economy so the demand for silver is different than it is for gold
6265469 the big argument for owning precious metals right now is theyre a better store of wealth than shares or than paper currencies
6265470 i think thats one of the things that gold investors were really concerned about with the gold etfs one of the risks now with precious metals is theres a lot of hot money out there that stampedes from one asset class to the other
6265471 the recent global financial crisis emanating from the us has largely left the bull market in precious metals alive and well
6265472 silver production has not been affected by this climate as we have minimal debt and demand for silver
6265473 trials may come to make me strong i must endure i must hold on yet still i rise never to give up
6265474 met een verbod op 168 paddestoelen is in de herfst het hele bos illegaal zelfs de paddestoel met rood met witte stippen gaat eraan het is hiermee een extremistische heksenvervolging geworden
6265475 in de herfst staan er in mijn tuin overal kaalkopjes
6265476 komt straks de paddopolitie mijn tuin in om te kijken wat er hier groeit zelfs op het grasveld van fc utrecht groeien paddos moet het stadion dan ook verboden worden ik kan niet tegen dat moralistische vroeger als student ging ik zelf plukken maar nu niet meer
6265477 paddos zijn voor mij wel heel belangrijk en ik wil dat toch wel een paar keer per jaar blijven doen
6265478 ik ga toch proberen illegaal om er aan te komen als het illegaal wordt gaan mensen het net zo hard gebruiken alleen dan zonder een goeie jongen die voorlichting geeft dan zullen er misschien wel ergere problemen ontstaan ik vind niet dat de overheid mij mag verbieden wat ik in mijn mond mag steken
6265479 kleine kinderen die in het bos lopen met een paddestoel zijn die dan straks strafbaar
6265480 minister klink is eigenlijk hartstikke liberaal maar hirsch ballin cda dat is een man met heel veel macht binnen de partij die wil het ene na het andere verbod hij viert echt een feestje klink heeft ook heel lang nagedacht over het verbod en wilde eigenlijk helemaal niet overgaan tot een verbod maar dan krijg je allerlei dealtjes op allerlei onderwerpen
6265481 ik vind niet dat de overheid mij mag verbieden wat ik in mijn mond mag steken

6265508 there is a stigma associated with online dating the stigma has lessened but it is still there to some extent
6265509 internet dating serves a very important function the traditional ways of getting people together certainly have broken down in recent decades most people are not beginning to search for a spouse until they are working and have lost contact with a lot of the people they knew in school or in college
6265510 i discuss dating online with friends but its not something i bring up with coworkers
6265511 in this area as in so many others weve substituted financial capital for social capital you no longer have an aunt sadie to help you find a date so you turn to an online dating service paying for the services of match com or eharmony
6265512 i have gone on a few dates with men i met online
6265513 but as soon as you tell people it gives them room to judge the person you met
6265514 i dont tell my family or coworkers about internet dating
6265515 i dont want my family to judge me or think that im desperate its a generational thing my parents didnt online date they wouldnt understand it or be able to relate to it they barely know how to go online
6265516 online dating especially serves a good function for older persons who have already been married and are back on the market because they have even more limited opportunities to meet good prospects than do never married persons in their twenties and thirties
6265517 my impression is that the stigma associated with online dating is less among older people but that is an impression only
6265518 do you remember the time when we went out with martin had dinner at this restaurant where the service was so bad we complained to the owner and the owner just gave us this if you dont like it you can leave attitude

6265522 theyre having to continually balance the capacity of the network there certainly has been a great enhancement from 2g to 3g but still pressures are put on the network

6265524 the data network is fully capable of handling this level of access weve built the network to handle the busiest likely data traffic peaks for internet access

6265528 so i decided it was good for me because i had an opportunity to play and not just be part of the team im 23 years old i dont have time to wait any more
6265529 we need ukic to play this year and i think thats what made it enticing for him to come

6265535 we were pleased with our earnings performance for the second quarter
6265536 our same store sales continue to be impacted by the current economic environment however we believe our marketing and messaging helped us during the quarter as our comparable sales performance continued to outpace the chicken quick service restaurant segment

6265542 n s sab amos que seria um jogo dif cil por causa da rivalidade que existe entre as equipes o sport veio com o prop sito de empatar e conseguiu
6265543 n s tivemos algumas oportunidades de abrir o placar no inicio do primeiro tempo se isso acontecesse o sport sairia para o jogo e n s encaixar amos os contra ataques
6265544 o vit ria teve cinco ou seis oportunidades de gol e n o fez o empate em casa sempre tem sabor de derrota o sport teve m rito em conseguir manter seu esquema de jogo e sair com o empate
6265545 i cant believe its been a year and were no closer to the answers we need then we were at the beginning
6265546 people need to stop this violence and they need to come forward with whoever did this
6265547 nobody knows nobody will come forward someone needs to come forward with this theres just been no info on it
6265548 i think hes saying thanks for being there for my mother and family
6265549 my decision to step down should not come as a surprise to anyone given that im now 85 years old
6265550 i have been so proud to be associated with gray since 1993
6265551 i am also extremely pleased that hilton howell has agreed to his increased responsibility with gray television
6265552 his appointment as chief executive officer shows that our family will continue to have a strong interest in and commitment to gray television well into the future

6265556 consumers have turned to the internet for olympic information in large numbers
6265557 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6265558 i dont think this proposal will solve it its a bad idea
6265559 as i welcome my new son to my family i am even more committed to ensuring that he lives in a city where health is among san joses top priorities
6265560 it is about our children its about our future what we are asking is to get the dialogue started we must do something to eliminate this
6265561 we believe a fast food moratorium would be a real detriment to our community

6265571 well take measures on our end but we also encourage customers to take measures on theirs
6265572 she had his back she just took care of the family to afford him to do what he needed to do
6265573 no complaints she knew his mission she was very supportive if he called on her to be there she was there
6265574 exporters dont have power to keep rising as the u s and european economies are getting worse and the demand volume is declining
6265575 the currency had been their only hope but the yen is getting a bit stronger now
6265576 one of the most serious cases albeit less publicized is the contamination produced by the nickel industry on the northeastern end of the island a cuban press release six years ago prensa latina 1994 disclosed that the pedro soto alba plant formerly moa bay dumped more than 12 000 cubic meters of untreated liquid waste 3 17 billion gallons into the sea daily the waste contained 72 tons of aluminum 48 tons of chromium 15 tons of magnesium and 30 tons of sulfuric acid by way of comparison the treatment standards for wastewater in the united states limit the concentration of chromium to a maximum of 0 32 milligrams per liter 12 times less than the daily dumping into moa bay by only one of the three nickel plants operating in the area
6265577 most investors both institutional and individual will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees those following this path are sure to beat the net results after fees and expenses delivered by the great majority of investment professionals
6265578 the plan is serviced by prudential retirement administered by the nc department of state treasurer and sponsored by the state of north carolina
6265579 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later i dont think they need any more additional time
6265580 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6265581 weve traditionally held our mad monday at local hotels and with the exception of last year they had been incident free
6265582 but this year we have decided to hold private functions and allow the boys to celebrate or commiserate with those involved with the club
6265583 on the saturday night after the grand final we will have a function complete with our own security and bar staff and on sunday we will have a mystery tour that will allow the boys to get out of town and celebrate their season together as a group
6265584 a lot of the media about sportspeople drinking is related to rugby league but that is because it is the premier sport in nsw

6265586 today god has called one of his devout disciples home the untimely departure of our beloved friend and fearless leader chairwoman stephanie tubbs jones is indescribable
6265587 this is an enormously solemn day for members of congress the congressional black caucus family ohio residents and the world chairwoman tubbs jones was undoubtedly a true steward of the people she dedicated her life to ensure that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness was afforded to every american her command of the law was only matched by her boundless sense of integrity
6265588 chairwoman tubbs jones illustrious career included a crowd of firsts
6265589 in the halls of congress she was revered by her colleagues as a fair yet firm chair of the standard of official conduct committee throughout ohio communities she was celebrated for her tireless advocacy and intervention within the congressional black caucus family she will be forever cherished and gravely missed
6265590 our collective prayers and condolences are extended to her son mervyn jones ii her sister barbara her entire family her staff and the host of loved ones who knew and loved her
6265591 theres not too much you can do to be honest with you
6265592 he has to do it himself thats how i see it ive talked to him he knows what he needs to do and hopefully hell do it
6265593 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6265594 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6265595 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems
6265596 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6265597 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6265598 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6265599 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6265600 theres not too much you can do to be honest with you
6265601 he has to do it himself thats how i see it ive talked to him he knows what he needs to do and hopefully hell do it
6265602 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6265603 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6265604 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems
6265605 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6265606 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6265607 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6265608 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6265609 we will carefully analyze this situation there wont be any aggressive action from anyone on our side we will behave in a pragmatic manner there will definitely not be a cold war
6265610 i am planning over the next few days to give certain signals concerning military cooperation i think the signals will be received positively by my nato colleagues
6265611 without russias support in afghanistan nato would face a new vietnam and this is clear to everyone militarily nato and russia have a very good and trusting relationship
6265612 now temporary decisions are being taken on the current cooperation and not about cooperation in general these decisions are of temporary character of regional character not global character
6265613 nato rearming georgia after all that has happened would be a serious contradiction in terms between nato and the european union it would be cynical and illegitimate
6265614 creo que todo es una broma porque nunca recib un mail de kenita este mail fue inteligentemente escrito por una tercera persona que maneja datos verdaderos
6265615 quien agreg que todo era una maquinaci n de sqp
6265616 if it is the will of the people of these republics and the decision of the president of russia
6265617 ive seen motorists do amazing things behind the wheel he said
6265618 they go straight through stop signs and red traffic lights or rear end other cars while talking on mobile phones fiddling with the radio turning around to yell at the kids checking their appearance in the rear view mirror or gawping out the window
6265619 traffic is constantly changing so its absolutely essential for drivers to keep their mind on the job and their eyes on the road
6265620 going on auto pilot behind the wheel is incredibly dangerous but so many motorists involved in collisions say they didnt see the stop sign red light or other car
6265621 the victory over the georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations in russia
6265622 it was remarkable that they shot down a number of russian fighters which russia probably did not expect
6265623 we will be introducing serious changes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for example
6265624 missiles and rockets would negate the need for large scale troop deployments in the way they had to carry them out
6265625 there is no way they could say from this operation that they are capable of carrying out operations against something as sophisticated as nato forces
6265626 the better the quality of hair straightener you use the better it will be for your hair
6265627 some straighteners have heat elements with hot spots on them and this is what you need to watch out for
6265628 lots of things can be damaging constant heat at high temperatures of course will damage hair
6265629 if you want to straighten hair using the correct products to protect the hair shaft will help
6265630 if you look at the sales statistics you can see people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
6265631 the problem some people have is when they do it wrong or too frequently they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
6265632 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6265633 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6265634 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6265635 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6265636 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6265637 you aint leading but two things right now jack and shit
6265638 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics

6265646 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6265647 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6265648 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6265649 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6265650 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6265651 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6265652 we are very pleased to be able to offer this feature to our web visitors and we hope that this tool will prove useful for regional disaster coordinators and the media
6265653 the matter was allocated a caseworker on june 15 having already previously been allocated i suggest to you that nothing was done
6265654 shes dead the bloody dogs have killed her im not bloody joking
6265655 i said someone get there quick i couldnt go back out there
6265656 if its safe why not take it to the mine in toongi
6265657 if we let them in with a little bit were going to get it all
6265658 if they had to take it to toongi they would have to build another facility theyre just trying to save money
6265659 we have a number of plastic lined dams that have to be filled in so we thought wed put this 400 800 tonnes of slurry into a plastic lined dam cover it up and revegetate it
6265660 the ansto minerals groups is one of best research facilities in nsw this nothing to do with anything nuclear
6265661 ticket sales have been fantastic and really justified our decision to include dubbo on the schedule
6265662 we usually head to places like broken hill and then down to mildura but we have decided to explore some unchartered places and we decided on dubbo because it gives us a chance to see the zoo and a few new places
6265663 the animals really make the show and draw the people and we have performing lions and monkeys
6265664 but we also have flying trapeze acts other acrobatics and some great clowns to perform throughout the shows
6265665 if we have to we will go back and fight for our motherland again we want our territory back
6265666 yes we are sad that we could not recover georgian territory but we are soldiers and we carry out our orders
6265667 they the russians took reasonably good care of me then i was handed back as part of the prisoner exchange
6265668 war brings good to nobody but he saakashvili is our commander in chief
6265669 we came under attack from south ossetian rebels we beat them back easily
6265670 do i win a empty paperbag or something of that sort
6265671 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
6265672 past returns tell you nothing about future returns and are not the right way to select investments
6265673 finally you must consider the tax consequences of investing especially in taxable accounts generally the most tax efficient way to use your different accounts is our thanks to taylor larimore and david grabiner for this list
6265674 to tell you the truth i just want to chill out right now
6265675 i want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6265676 hes lively hes fun he plays to the crowd i mean his last names bolt and hes only 21
6265677 right now in jamaica the rum is flowing and the reggae is playing
6265678 we have the best coffee in the world we had bob marley who gave the world a new religion
6265679 and we have usain bolt he means so much in every corner of jamaica every man every woman every child
6265680 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he hits his prime
6265681 this is a fast track i told myself that if im going to get that world record im going to get it here
6265682 i knew i would go that fast ive been running fast times and shutting down at the end
6265683 to tell you the truth i just want to chill out right now
6265684 i want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6265685 hes lively hes fun he plays to the crowd i mean his last names bolt and hes only 21
6265686 right now in jamaica the rum is flowing and the reggae is playing
6265687 we have the best coffee in the world we had bob marley who gave the world a new religion
6265688 and we have usain bolt he means so much in every corner of jamaica every man every woman every child
6265689 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he hits his prime
6265690 this is a fast track i told myself that if im going to get that world record im going to get it here
6265691 i knew i would go that fast ive been running fast times and shutting down at the end
6265692 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6265693 o que mais preocupa n o nem o grito dos violentos dos corruptos dos desonestos dos sem car ter dos sem tica o que mais preocupa o sil ncio dos bons
6265694 ele lula acha importante a preserva o mas entre um cerradinho qualquer e a soja ele soja o ambiente uma quest o importante mas n o decisiva o decisivo a economia
6265695 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6265696 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6265697 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6265698 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal
6265699 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6265700 we have wanted russia to be a part of the greater international community
6265701 russia is making a decision and we certainly hope that its not a long term strategic decision but russias making a decision thats only isolating itself
6265702 the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6265703 weve indicated that that equipment should not have been moved or removed
6265704 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6265705 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6265706 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6265707 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6265708 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6265709 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6265710 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6265711 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6265712 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6265713 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6265714 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6265715 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6265716 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6265717 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6265718 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6265719 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6265720 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6265721 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6265722 they told me there are going to be resources here
6265723 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6265724 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6265725 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6265726 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6265727 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6265728 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6265729 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6265730 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6265731 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6265732 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6265733 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6265734 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6265735 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6265736 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6265737 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6265738 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6265739 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6265740 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6265741 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6265742 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6265743 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6265744 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6265745 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6265746 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6265747 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6265748 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6265749 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6265750 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6265751 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6265752 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6265753 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6265754 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6265755 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6265756 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6265757 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6265758 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6265759 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6265760 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6265761 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6265762 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6265763 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6265764 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6265765 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6265766 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6265767 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6265768 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6265769 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6265770 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6265771 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6265772 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6265773 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6265774 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6265775 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6265776 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6265777 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6265778 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6265779 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6265780 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6265781 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6265782 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6265783 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6265784 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6265785 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6265786 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6265787 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6265788 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6265789 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6265790 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6265791 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6265792 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6265793 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6265794 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6265795 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6265796 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6265797 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6265798 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6265799 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6265800 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6265801 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6265802 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6265803 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6265804 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6265805 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6265806 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6265807 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6265808 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6265809 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6265810 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6265811 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6265812 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6265813 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6265814 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6265815 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6265816 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6265817 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6265818 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6265819 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6265820 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6265821 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6265822 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6265823 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6265824 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6265825 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6265826 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6265827 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6265828 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6265829 its been the same old story we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts
6265830 we cant keep our cars together we had dash malfunctions motors breaking at this point we dont even deserve to be in the chase
6265831 by becoming the first ever software as a service company to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of one billion dollars our second quarter performance is a milestone for salesforce
6265832 said chairman and chief executive marc benioff in a prepared statement
6265833 our largest customers are increasingly becoming the best examples of what is possible using the power of our growing portfolio of software as a service applications and our emerging platform as a service
6265834 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6265835 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6265836 real men goes the unwritten rule of american punctuation dont use semi colons
6265837 wouldnt be seen dead in a ditch with a semi colon though truman capote might real men goes the unwritten rule of american punctuation dont use semi colons
6265838 the most pusillanimous sissified utterly useless mark of punctuation ever invented
6265839 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6265840 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6265841 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
6265842 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
6265843 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
6265844 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
6265845 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
6265846 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6265847 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6265848 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6265849 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6265850 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6265851 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6265852 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6265853 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6265854 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6265855 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6265856 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6265857 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6265858 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6265859 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6265860 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6265861 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6265862 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6265863 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6265864 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6265865 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6265866 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6265867 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6265868 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6265869 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6265870 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6265871 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6265872 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6265873 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6265874 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6265875 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6265876 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6265877 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6265878 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6265879 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6265880 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6265881 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6265882 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6265883 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6265884 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6265885 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6265886 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6265887 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6265888 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6265889 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6265890 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6265891 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6265892 there is no longer this widespread belief among the wise guys and gals of both parties that were all just sitting around waiting for this race to break in obamas direction the polls as well as the money race suggest otherwise
6265893 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6265894 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6265895 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6265896 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6265897 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6265898 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6265899 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6265900 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6265901 the whole scenario is just too neat too clean to be coincidental
6265902 regardless of what has become of these men the real tragedy is that the world may never learn what they knew about this elusive and majestic mammal
6265903 i keep clicking the enhance filter but its not getting any clearer
6265904 on csi its no trouble at all to reconstruct details that were never present in the original image i guess we need to find whatever software theyre using
6265905 at the final stages of the transfer window usually something happens but only if it is a player i feel can improve the squad
6265906 we have so many young players here we should focus on their growth to enable them to improve
6265907 we are well prepared i think our preparations went very well and i am curious to see how the team reacts against modena in the coppa italia and siena in the championship
6265908 will i remain at lazio i dont know the club must decide
6265909 my duty at the moment is to give everything i can to this jersey then well see

6265914 these conclusions contrast strongly with those of recent publications copyright 2007 royal meteorological society
6265915 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6265916 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6265917 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6265918 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6265919 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
6265920 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
6265921 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6265922 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6265923 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
6265924 would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives
6265925 black leaders from around the country will hold a power in the park rally and press conference on august 25 2008 8 30 am at martin luther king park one block from the largest planned parenthood abortuary in the nation although black women comprise 6 of the population they receive nearly 40 of the abortions in america the leading abortion providers exploit blacks by placing 94 of abortuaries in urban neighborhoods with high black populations the number one taker of black life is abortion and its time people woke up to that fact the location of this latest planned parenthood facility in yet another minority neighborhood is a part of the continuing fulfillment of the racist eugenicist dream of their founder margaret sanger but it is a travesty of the american dream planned parenthoods agenda discards the principle that we are all created equal which is the basis of liberty for all americans
6265926 my friend was stopped at a checkpoint on the road to irbil from baghdad
6265927 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6265928 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6265929 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6265930 woods delusional beliefs are true to him and always presented in grandiose fashion
6265931 given his long standing history of mental illness gov perry must not allow mr woods execution to go forward without allowing the court to rule on this rudimentary due process right
6265932 amounts to a type of private communication contact or tampering that is outside the evidence and law
6265933 but if he struck him down with an iron object so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
6265934 washington policy makers and housing industry insiders hope a new tax credit for first time home buyers will get the moribund housing market moving again
6265935 breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind
6265936 at issue is the democrats proposal to make up for the deficit largely by increasing taxes on californias wealthiest residents a plan that republicans oppose in a vote sunday not a single assembly republican voted for the plan to raise 6 7 billion in revenue largely through income tax increases republicans account for 32 of the assemblys 80 seats but california requires that two thirds of the legislature approve the budget similar conflicts over how to make up budget deficits in tough economic times could crop up in other states over the next year because of the housing crisis said kim rueben a fellow with the public policy institute of california who studies state budgets ms rueben said california is particularly susceptible to economic changes as it is heavily dependent on income taxes on the rich thanks largely to limits on property tax increases as well as a 2004 measure that imposed increased taxes on the wealthy the democrats plan for more income tax increases amounts to exaggerating a tendency thats already one of the states biggest tax problems she said assembly speaker karen bass a democrat said there is little choice because the state has already cut funding for programs and needs to find more revenue both sides have been reluctant to accept gov arnold schwarzeneggers proposal for a temporary sales tax increase im very skeptical of any politician claiming they want a temporary tax said republican assemblyman chuck devore in the future he said legislators will argue that they have grown accustomed to the tax and we need the revenue democrats said the sales tax places an undue burden on poor and middle income residents democrats say a sales tax increase would be regressive that stance could be changing in the wake of sundays vote which was preceded by a debate in which dozens of legislators aired their grievances ms bass in between meetings with mr villines said both parties are discussing a sales tax increase with a built in end date and several measures to close tax loopholes for the wealthy that wont amount to increases in the income tax rate for example she said democrats and republicans agree that a rule exempting out of state yacht purchases from state taxes could be changed she and mr villines said they expect to reach a compromise sometime this week the key to the latest talks she said was the sunday debate frankly the catharsis was needed yesterday ms bass said on monday

6265959 artinya syaitan menjanjikan menakut nakuti kamu dengan kemiskinan dan menyuruh kamu berbuat kejahatan kikir sedangkan allah menjanjikan kepadamu ampunan dari nya dan karunia dan allah maha luas karunia nya lag maha mengetahui
6265960 artinya perumpamaan nafkah yang dikeluarkan oleh orang orang yang menafkahkan hartanya di jalan allah adalah serupa dengan sebutir benih yang menumbuhkan tujuh bulir pada tiap tiap butir seratus biji allah melipatgandakan ganjaran bagi siapa yang dia kehendaki dan allah maha luas karunia nya lagi maha mengetahui
6265961 artinya dan perumpamaan orang orang yang membelanjakan hartanya karena mencari keridhaan allah dan untuk keteguhan jiwa mereka adalah seperti kebun yang terletak di dataran tinggi yang disiram oleh hujan lebat maka kebun itu menghasilkan buahnya dua kali lipat jika hujan lebat itu tidak menyiraminya maka hujan gerimispun telah cukup baginya dan allah maha melihat apa yang kamu perbuat

6265994 command and control organizations cannot bring about the conditions and competencies necessary to successfully meet the challenges holistically for the most part organizations know this and have attempted to reorganize themselves using the principles of total quality management and reengineering

6265997 the relationship must be one in which there is mutual respect trust and mutual freedom of expression
6265998 the rigor of pragmatism requires that as coaches we continually undo our conclusions and face each coaching situation with a willingness to learn anew and find out that what we learned last time does not apply now
6265999 language provides for us the horizon of possible actions experiences relationships and meanings
6266000 sen mccain was crisp decisive knew what he was about knew his values
6266001 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
6266002 evil does exist i mean i think we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil sadly on the streets of our cities it has to be confronted squarely i think it is very important for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good j ust because we think that our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
6266003 but i say to you do not resist one who is evil
6266004 he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty
6266005 a man of quick temper acts foolishly but a man of discretion is patient
6266006 he who is slow to anger has great understanding but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly
6266007 a hot tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger quiets contention
6266008 let every man be quick to hear slow to speak slow to anger for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of god
6266009 even if i had lost today i think i would have been pretty satisfied with my performance if a bit disappointed
6266010 these are the kind of matches i have been losing in the last year at some point it affects your confidence so to win one like this is good and hopefully i can build from here
6266011 i didnt play any matches for two weeks and i had never played her before so didnt know what to expect
6266012 but it was ok i lost my rhythm a bit on my serve but i fought to the end and i am very pleased with the win
6266013 i have been working really hard and playing well but its very satisfying to see the results coming now
6266014 my first goal is to break into the top 100 then i can set another goal hopefully i can keep going from here
6266015 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6266016 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6266017 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6266018 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6266019 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations

6266032 we love auctions auction style listings remain the ideal choice for sellers who are uncertain about the value of their item have a scarce item in high demand or are willing to start at a low price and let bidding determine the final value

6266038 its not really in the way of anything and you wouldnt go there unless you had a reason to go there
6266039 theres a track that goes through the park that gives people access to the station but the bushland is quite far from the track and is really dense scrub so its not surprising that no one discovered the bones by accident
6266040 however it is a bit ironic that hundreds of people walk past it everyday and no one had located the remains
6266041 we are pleased to complete the acquisition of sgx and are excited to bring the scientific and technological expertise of sgx into lillys research organization
6266042 we will leverage the combined resources of both companies to strengthen our structural biology capabilities and seek out innovative therapies for patients

6266044 weve really done much of that one our own we havent just gone to albany and said give give give
6266045 you consider what it costs to hire a police officer you consider what it costs to pave a street certainly that would have meant potential cuts in services delaying or cancelization of neighborhood programs and at the worse case perhaps even a tax hike
6266046 and i think they understand that any cut to local state aid would most likely have the kind of impact that theyve been trying to avoid
6266047 get ready because its going to a be a bumpy ride
6266048 there could always be the possibility that the legislature after they are safely re elected on november 4th could come back into special session in late november and make even further cuts

6266055 ive seen motorists do amazing things behind the wheel he said
6266056 they go straight through stop signs and red traffic lights or rear end other cars while talking on mobile phones fiddling with the radio turning around to yell at the kids checking their appearance in the rear view mirror or gawping out the window
6266057 traffic is constantly changing so its absolutely essential for drivers to keep their mind on the job and their eyes on the road
6266058 going on auto pilot behind the wheel is incredibly dangerous but so many motorists involved in collisions say they didnt see the stop sign red light or other car
6266059 by definition anything from cook is pretty rare and pretty magical
6266060 there are incredibly few things which is why this auction is so exciting and also because its a boomerang which is such an iconic thing
6266061 there are plenty of cook collectors and i would think some australian institutions would be interested

6266108 it is critical that all components selected for our convention center project meet two objectives
6266109 first given the scale of the project all components must be proven technology of the highest quality to assure optimal generating capability second the reliability of each component in the power generation chain is paramount to providing maximum long term system viability satcon brings the technology and proven solutions that will enable us to accomplish this
6266110 the accva project demonstrates the increasing demand for our photovoltaic inverters to be used in larger utility scale installations in north america
6266111 this demand is further reflected in the upward trend in our backlog for these products to date our net backlog is approximately 49 million with approximately 59 coming from pv and fuel cell inverter orders at the end of the second quarter of 2008 our backlog was approximately 45 million inline with our backlog for the past four quarters this clearly shows the strength of our backlog and the growing demand for our photovoltaic and fuel cell solutions as utility scale installations become the global trend
6266112 we are pleased to report another strong quarter driven by our focused strategy to grow student enrollment and service revenue our second quarter financial results reflect strong organic growth in our online degree program services resulting from our expanded course offerings and our ability to partner with well recognized universities throughout china we recently signed eight new contracts bringing us to a total of 20 partnerships with leading universities across china
6266113 we have been offering recruitment and support services to the new partner institutions through our learning center network and we remain one of only three institutions approved to operate such a network in various cities and provinces throughout china we continue to invest in expanding our learning center network as we believe this will further boost student enrollment in our online degree programs and generate significant additional revenue in the long term

6266125 thats because youve never seen me on a day ive missed my workout
6266126 analyses over time showed that individuals who increased their level of exercise did not experience a decrease in anxious and depressive symptoms
6266127 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6266128 across all the business units there are extensive programs in place to help ensure the momentum of the past 18 months continues into the current year mr mckenzie said
6266129 there is evidence however that global economies are slowing and this could impact the growth in sales
6266130 inflationary pressures are increasing with the impact of higher oil prices flowing through to input costs and higher cost inflation in most countries mr mckenzie said
6266131 the profit after tax of 369 million was a solid result given the negative impact on earnings of the strong australian dollar chief executive ken mckenzie said
6266132 earnings are anticipated to improve in the current year however growth will be substantially lower than the 29 3 per cent achieved in 2007 08 and is dependent on the impact a slowing us economy may have on volume growth mr mckenzie said
6266133 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6266134 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6266135 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6266136 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6266137 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6266138 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6266139 confidence that we can meet our insurance profit target for 2008 of around 20 per cent of net earned premium
6266140 the acquisitions converted to date have enabled us to use a portion of our excess capital
6266141 we are experiencing increased acquisition activity with opportunities being presented in many of the markets in which we operate
6266142 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6266143 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008
6266144 the company is on track to deliver double digit growth in npat looking forward creating improved shareholder value and delivering world class services and assets to our clients chief executive geoff knox said
6266145 significant change program during the past year with the benefits set to continue as the group leverages increased operational synergies over the next few years
6266146 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories
6266147 we will however continue to invest in new stores and the expansion of our existing stores with a view to delivering further growth in returns to our shareholders
6266148 our sales performance is particularly pleasing as it was achieved in a tougher market and against double digit growth in the previous year mr moir said
6266149 we opened five new stores expanded four existing stores and continued rolling out new fitout concepts in both myer and david jones
6266150 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go

6266153 i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for the other two guys
6266154 we expect the current property market volatility to remain for the foreseeable future with the timing of recovery in property markets in the us and uk dependent on the recovery of liquidity in the financial markets mr clarke said
6266155 the us and uk residential markets continue to suffer from lack of liquidity and inventory overhang
6266156 in comparison the australian market is stronger and while slowing should not see the same level of impact
6266157 our strong positive cashflow combined with capital recycling has provided cash on hand of 842 8 million allowing us to continue to fund our investment pipeline while exploring growth opportunities he said
6266158 mr clarke had given the company a commitment of between five to seven years when he was appointed in december 2002 chairman david crawford said
6266159 greg has driven a tremendous turnaround in the fortunes of lend lease since he joined
6266160 at the moment palm is just trying to keep the company going before this hopefully revolutionary new device arrives
6266161 the problem here is the pricing structure has changed the iphone went down to 200 the samsung instinct went down to 230
6266162 this is no longer the same phone market we had a year ago
6266163 what matters to them is what they can do why do people love iphone they love the apps why dont people love windows mobile its in fact an amazing operating system but the apps on top of it not so inspired
6266164 its really exciting its one of the biggest mysteries right now
6266165 the security situation is deteriorating and its worrisome for europe
6266166 riddled with internal problems and are mainly aiming to raise internal troop morale
6266167 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble

6266170 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined medical doctors and neurosurgeons from huron hospital and cleveland clinic sadly report that at 6 12 p m congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones died
6266171 i was stunned by the news today of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones there is a great gap where she stood on behalf of affordable health care womens issues access to quality education and fairness in voting

6266178 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain the company said
6266179 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6266180 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy he said
6266181 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares he said
6266182 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions mr dixon said
6266183 i will stay in the house as long as i can i wont ruin my property with a two car garage
6266184 this is why we have a public hearing and the city council exists to consider the human factor
6266185 our job is to serve the people not always following black and white
6266186 i needed the extra space so my mother could move in with me
6266187 i left it up to the contractor at that time all he had to do was build a carport for about 1 800 but he left after the addition was finished he said the carport was not needed
6266188 this is a decision the community has been waiting for for a long time
6266189 a lot of people wanted this new council to just come in and terminate the contract but it wasnt something that could be done like that our attorneys kept telling us not to because we had to do this the right way otherwise the developer would still win
6266190 im glad that we listened but being patient wasnt the hard part
6266191 what was difficult was having to face members of the community whose homes would be affected by the project and not be able to give them answers right away we just hope that now they know that we needed to do this this way
6266192 as of today there are no more agreements between angeles fields solid gracie and lynwood promenade theyve been terminated
6266193 anytime after the expiration period expires the agency has the discretion to move forward or not to move forward
6266194 as of right now those agreements were not complied with
6266195 the developer did not satisfy the terms and conditions of those agreements
6266196 this council works as a team this council has always cared about what the community has to say
6266197 the community may not always agree with us but we do have the communitys best interest in mind and we know that this specific project did not have the communitys best interest
6266198 why not in an industrial area an area that needs to be redeveloped not in an area where schools and homes would be involved but they were very adamant because of the freeway access
6266199 the developer got his notice of default told him he had 30 days to comply and he didnt so that gives us the legal grounds to terminate it if they really wanted to move forward with this project they had 30 days to comply with the contract
6266200 if the developer wants to come back and do another proposal for another area of the community they have the right to do so like any other developer and this council will make an educated decision at that time whether or not they want to accept anything from him
6266201 a lot of us in this affected area just recently finished paying off our homes
6266202 when residents were collecting signatures for the recall i met a lot of my neighbors i watched people cry because they were going to lose what theyve worked for all their lives their homes here weve worked all of our lives to pay off our homes and then its taken away just like that
6266203 we need people in office who are going to represent the community because we elect them to work for the people these are the types of leaders that we are going to always support people who are in it for themselves dont deserve our vote
6266204 we plan a local campaign to address the portrayal of an individual with an intellectual disability in the movie tropic thunder which opened nationwide this week
6266205 the arc of southeast los angeles county joins the efforts of the arc of the united states and other national advocacy groups mobilizing around the use of hate speech in referring to persons with intellectual disabilities
6266206 arc is urging the general public not to spend their hard earned dollars on this film because of its deplorable and demeaning view of a person with intellectual disabilities
6266207 this is an opportunity to educate our neighbors about the rights of people with disabilities most importantly to live with the same dignity afforded every ordinary american
6266208 unfortunately this movie sets us back many years as we fight for the rights of people with disabilities
6266209 people with intellectual disabilities have the right to hold a job to have friends and to live in peace free from ridicule and being the object of jokes

6266213 the most damaging evidence offered against phil spector at his first trial on the charge of murdering lana clarkson did not concern the night ms clarkson died
6266214 rather the prosecution well aware that its evidence of those events left considerable doubt as to the cause of clarksons death sought to call a host of women to testify that years even decades prior to 2003 phil spector had threatened them with a firearm generally while he was drunk

6266227 theres no incentive for the owner to stay in the home theres no down payment so there is a high rate of default and foreclosure because theyll just walk away

6266230 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6266231 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6266232 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6266233 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6266234 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6266235 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed

6266244 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said

6266246 confidence that we can meet our insurance profit target for 2008 of around 20 per cent of net earned premium
6266247 the acquisitions converted to date have enabled us to use a portion of our excess capital
6266248 we are experiencing increased acquisition activity with opportunities being presented in many of the markets in which we operate
6266249 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6266250 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008

6266261 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6266262 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6266263 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities
6266264 deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6266265 take full appropriate measures against any firms or individuals who have violated securities laws and we fully support them in their efforts

6266267 our understanding is that he was released from custody when mexican courts ruled that he couldnt be extradited because the statute of limitations had run out

6266277 the timing of the conclusion of the missile defense deal is anything but accidental
6266278 now that the missile system is going forward the deal takes on much sharper overtones from the russian perspective
6266279 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6266280 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6266281 getting used to the new terminology getting used to coach summers making that transition it has been rough
6266282 i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front
6266283 they the offensive line give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball
6266284 he has studied and learned the offense really well because of that he can communicate that to the rest of the players
6266285 the center sets the protection and basically controls the direction that the protection goes to
6266286 we have 18 different protections and the reason that we do is that we dont allow the defense to take us out of our passing game
6266287 not only from a scheme standpoint but a technical standpoint each of our protections require different techniques
6266288 i think throughout the summer luigs did a nice job
6266289 hes a guy who we are very happy to have
6266290 to have both me and brett from arkansas and at the same time i mean we played against each other i guess that really says something about the work ethic we both have to be where we are now

6266307 this is ridiculous no one in their right mind would sign a form like this and it certainly isnt a condition of probation for you to sign it

6266309 is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators he was eventually reprimanded by the congress for the appearance of impropriety the senator reportedly has a violent temper and can be extremely confrontational and profane when angry these red flags about senator mccains character are reminiscent of the man who now occupies the white house
6266310 speaking as a private individual i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances

6266312 nothing beats the elegance of a white starched khadi kurta the sheer texture and fall of the fabric makes it extremely stylish
6266313 i prefer colours like beige cream olive and other natural tones in handloom fabrics
6266314 for a trendy look try wearing a khadi silk waistcoat over a silk shirt and a pair of well fitting jeans accessorise it with a nice printed scarf or cravat woolen khadi jackets can be sported in winters over shirts or tees
6266315 women can choose from khadi kurtas that are printed embroidered or have appliqu work done on them they can be worn over salwars churidars or denims depending on their preference
6266316 khadi sarees are a huge hit abroad women can make a big fashion statement by wearing a khadi cotton or silk saree accessorise with junk or ethnic jewellery top this with a big tikka and lots of kajal to get the perfect indian look
6266317 silk khadi dresses are in vogue those made from bhagalpuri or assam silk are very soft and come in dazzling colours you get them in western cuts and designs at various designer stores
6266318 they are great for the summers and pretty affordable too
6266319 khadi woolens are the ultimate in comfort and luxury sport a stole shawl or muffler made from pashmina angora or yak wool and youll make heads turn khadi woolens come in bright colours and varied designs
6266320 as khadi is a natural fabric it allows the skin to breathe in every season unlike synthetic fabrics
6266321 a soft cotton khadi kurta can be really comfortable in the summers

6266327 i have long supported a systematic and streamlined approach to loan modifications to put borrowers into long term sustainable mortgages achieving an improved return for bankers and investors compared to foreclosure
6266328 i think a lot of the mortgage lenders will frankly welcome the initiative
6266329 there are a lot of mortgages out there where foreclosure will be the best outcome
6266330 it will be interesting to see how this experiment will turn out
6266331 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes

6266343 the resizing at the broken hill operation is prudent conserves cash and positions the operation for the future
6266344 the company is confident that the broken hill operation can be sustained to maintain a level of continuity of production and one that is financially viable at current metal prices for at least the next 2 to 3 years without significant compromise to the longer term life of mine
6266345 the resizing at the broken hill operation is prudent conserves cash and positions the operation for the future the company is confident that the broken hill operation can be sustained to maintain a level of continuity of production and one that is financially viable at current metal prices for at least the next 2 to 3 years without significant compromise to the longer term life of mine
6266346 should metal prices increase in the future we will be in a strong position to ramp up production at the broken hill operation and to utilise the full potential of the broken hill concentrator with ore sources from the southern operations potosi the north mine and flying doctor
6266347 regrettably the lower production rate necessitates a reduction in our workforce from 760 to 320 employees the affected employees will be provided with their full entitlements and supported in the transition the decision to reduce our workforce has not been taken lightly and we are mindful of the impact upon individuals their families and the community we firmly believe that this is the best option to ensure continuity of operations and to preserve the mine for the long term benefit of the community and the shareholders

6266349 we found that in 2005 fully one third of chinas greenhouse gas emissions were due to production of exports this proportion has risen quickly from 12 percent in 1987 and only 21 percent in 2002
6266350 it is clear that urgent improvements are needed especially in chinas electricity sector installing more renewable power and overcoming the financial and technological hurdles involved with new technologies such as carbon sequestration should be the first priority of both china and its export partners

6266353 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6266354 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6266355 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6266356 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6266357 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6266358 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6266359 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6266360 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6266361 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6266362 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6266367 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

6266369 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6266370 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6266371 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6266372 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6266373 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6266374 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6266375 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6266376 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6266377 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6266381 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6266382 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6266383 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6266385 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6266386 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is

6266397 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6266398 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6266399 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6266400 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6266401 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6266402 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6266403 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6266404 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6266405 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6266406 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6266407 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6266408 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6266409 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6266410 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6266411 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6266412 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6266413 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6266414 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6266415 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6266416 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6266417 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6266418 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6266419 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6266420 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6266421 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6266422 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6266423 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6266424 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6266425 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6266426 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6266427 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6266428 this is a planning took where all things are going
6266429 we have posted energy use monitoring devices in the past but none as playful and beautiful as this one the flowerpod from design nord is a visual aid for the user to track energy consumption within the home the concept is that the device will grow like an actual plant would starting as a sprout then continuing healthily if energy use is favorable however if your demand increases the life will seep from the flowerpod until eventually it dies predetermined energy levels dictate favorable energy consumption or overuse but the goal is to make the flower blossom and to be aware of your energy choices in a fun way
6266430 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires

6266453 somebody or somebodies took the time to express what is the most virulent symbol of anti semitism that anyone can think of
6266454 its ugly and no one likes to see this in our community
6266455 it is possible that its the work of one of those groups
6266456 the police should do everything in their power to recognize that this is a hate crime and should do everything to apprehend the perpetrators
6266457 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6266458 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6266459 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6266460 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6266461 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6266462 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6266463 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6266464 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6266465 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6266466 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6266467 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6266468 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6266469 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6266470 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6266471 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6266472 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6266473 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6266474 history of crashing into people in his wheelchair and zipping blindly around corners
6266475 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6266476 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6266477 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6266478 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6266479 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6266480 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6266481 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6266482 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6266483 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6266484 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6266485 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6266486 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6266487 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6266488 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6266489 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6266490 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6266491 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6266492 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6266493 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6266494 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6266497 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6266498 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6266499 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6266500 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6266501 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6266502 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6266503 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6266504 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6266505 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6266506 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6266507 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6266508 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6266509 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6266510 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6266511 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6266512 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6266513 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6266514 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6266515 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6266516 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6266517 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6266518 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6266519 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6266520 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6266521 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6266522 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6266523 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6266524 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6266525 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6266526 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6266527 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6266528 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6266529 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6266530 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6266531 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6266532 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6266533 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6266534 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6266535 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6266536 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6266537 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6266538 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6266539 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6266540 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6266541 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6266542 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6266543 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6266544 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6266545 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6266546 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6266547 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6266548 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6266549 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6266550 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6266565 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

6266568 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

6266572 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6266573 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6266574 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6266575 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6266576 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6266577 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6266578 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6266579 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6266580 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

6266588 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6266589 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6266590 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6266596 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6266597 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6266598 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6266599 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6266600 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6266601 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6266602 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6266603 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6266604 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6266605 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6266606 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6266607 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6266608 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6266609 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6266610 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6266611 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6266612 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6266613 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6266614 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6266615 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6266616 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6266617 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6266618 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6266619 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6266620 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6266621 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6266622 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6266623 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6266624 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6266625 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6266626 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6266627 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6266628 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6266629 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6266630 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6266631 ok my car is this long i can fit into these spaces
6266632 the results were also due to the hard work and commitment of our employees
6266633 we have benefited from a strong revenue environment which was supported by major investments in customer service and product
6266634 the result was further underpinned by sustained efforts to improve efficiency
6266635 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6266636 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown
6266637 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6266638 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6266639 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6266640 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6266641 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6266642 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6266643 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6266644 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6266645 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6266646 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6266647 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6266648 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6266649 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6266650 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6266651 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6266652 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6266653 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6266654 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6266655 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6266656 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6266657 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6266658 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6266659 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6266660 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6266661 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6266662 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6266663 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6266664 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6266665 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6266666 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6266667 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6266668 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6266669 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6266670 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6266671 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6266672 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6266673 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6266674 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6266675 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6266676 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6266677 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6266678 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6266679 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6266680 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6266681 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6266682 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6266683 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6266684 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6266685 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6266686 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6266687 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6266688 l rare har en central roll i arbetet med att v nda den negativa utvecklingen av elevers m luppfyllelse
6266689 they climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies

6266691 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6266692 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6266693 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories
6266694 we will however continue to invest in new stores and the expansion of our existing stores with a view to delivering further growth in returns to our shareholders
6266695 our sales performance is particularly pleasing as it was achieved in a tougher market and against double digit growth in the previous year mr moir said
6266696 we opened five new stores expanded four existing stores and continued rolling out new fitout concepts in both myer and david jones
6266697 it wasnt an issue until the beginning of this year when the networks started broadcasting different hd content
6266698 people are now understanding more about what they are missing out on so the issue will just become bigger
6266699 seven and ten did a great job of advertising them their hd channels but we failed as a group to tell consumers that if you invested in an sd product you wont get all the hd channels
6266700 ten did the masters golf only on its hd channel so we had consumers bringing their tvs back because they couldnt see the golf
6266701 we were giving away hd boxes to consumers to appease their perception at the point of sale
6266702 so our concern about education is not the analogue to digital issue but the clarification of what digital tv you buy
6266703 the confusion needs to be eliminated so in terms of labelling not only do we need to state that this product is digital but that if you get hd you get all the channels
6266704 the secret about my business is the broadcasters offering content
6266705 hay 11 heridos entre nativos y polic as tras los disturbios presentados en esa provincia amaz nica
6266706 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
6266707 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of t
6266708 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
6266709 i dont think this proposal will solve it its a bad idea
6266710 as i welcome my new son to my family i am even more committed to ensuring that he lives in a city where health is among san joses top priorities
6266711 it is about our children its about our future what we are asking is to get the dialogue started we must do something to eliminate this
6266712 we believe a fast food moratorium would be a real detriment to our community

6266719 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6266720 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6266721 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria
6266722 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6266723 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6266724 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6266725 i know exactly what to do but i cant seem to apply it to myself
6266726 congresswoman tubbs jones sudden passing obviously comes as a shock to all of us who had the privilege to serve with her this is a sad day for the house but even more so for the people of cleveland who have lost a favorite daughter and fearless champion
6266727 though her historic career in public life led her to the top of the house ethics committee congresswoman tubbs jones did not require a gavel to be heard
6266728 liz has had a great influence on me and having a family has really helped my cricket

6266736 its not a matter of size its a matter of skill
6266737 i would love to fight mundine he says he wants to take on the best middleweights 72kg in the world but lets see how he goes against a junior welterweight 64kg first in terms of skill i would give him a boxing lesson
6266738 mundine looked dreadful against japanese fighter crazy kim last month
6266739 im old enough and small enough for mundine to see me as a prospective opponent
6266740 ex ass per ate ed you know how sometimes people can annoy you
6266741 sometimes they annoy you and annoy you and annoy you and annoy you and annoy you and annoy you and then they annoy you some more when they do that you get beyond frustrated to whats called exasperated thats where i am right now
6266742 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6266743 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6266744 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6266745 even if you are on the right track youll get run over if you just sit there
6266746 this is a movie to get drunk to because it depresses you to think that so much hate and destruction can exist and that so much beauty can go to waste
6266747 face reality as it is not as it was or as you wish it to be
6266748 managing by walking around mbwa made famous in the 1982 best selling book

6266751 he just lays here and is good he likes me
6266752 the cat just crawls in with them the cat they pet a lot of them like cats some of them dont like dogs
6266753 what i like the most about it is its such a simple thing but the delight it gives them the smile just very rewarding
6266754 i dont want women who listen to the study to negate the importance of doing a self breast exam
6266755 i always tell my patients that im teaching about breast self exams that its our responsibility to detect changes said whitehead
6266756 its our physician or health care responsibility to diagnose what those changes are
6266757 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6266758 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6266759 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6266760 it aint nothing crazy like hes missing or whatever i just want accountability to make sure that he dont come up there while hes on his time to do something crazy because i asked him to call me but he never called
6266761 search of the centralized operations police system did not reveal any prior domestic assault allegations or weapons registered to sgt lopez or mrs lopez
6266762 review of sgt lopezs medical records showed there were no indicators of post traumatic stress disorder and he was not prescribed any medication for ptsd
6266763 sgt lopez and his wife were pending a divorce for some unknown act of infidelity
6266764 i tried to come here and be the right person for my wife and kids but i guess im not the right person im messed up boss im messed up
6266765 hes suicidal and i dont want nothing to happen to this young soldier
6266766 i dont want this dude to commit suicide or to kill his family you know and thats whats on our minds right now
6266767 thats probably why hes worried about coming in he thinks hes going to get arrested for being awol
6266768 just so you know youre not in any trouble they havent put out any warrants or anything for you being gone so thats not what its about
6266769 my dad is buying me a bus ticket asap since the army quit paying me after six years of my life i gave to it ill call you or someone when i get to the bus stop

6266773 at first it was the basics editing and splicing tape
6266774 but when i learned they had a radio station thats when it got exciting
6266775 we know how hard it is to get your name out there we remember what it was like before myspace

6266785 if i read this to you and did not tell you that it was an fbi agent describing what americans had done to prisoners in their control
6266786 you would most certainly believe this must have been done by nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings sadly that is not the case this was the action of americans in the treatment of their prisoners

6266828 albany n y besides budget related legislation the new york state senate passed a bill banning gas price zones where wholesale retailers can have a 20 cent or more difference in gas prices depending on the location for example the bjs station in victor charges members 3 85 a gallon while the station in henrietta charges 3 62 there has been a price war of sorts on gas stations on and near west henrietta road consumers have noticed the difference and say theres no reason there should be such a price difference between the east side of town and the west side
6266829 the new york state senate today gave final legislative approval to a bill sponsored by senator jim alesi r perinton to prohibit discriminatory pricing policies by petroleum companies
6266830 one of the underlying contributors to the high gas prices especially in upstate new york is a little known practice known as zone pricing

6266859 generally provincial policy direction is to preserve prime agriculture land and to direct growth to settlements areas
6266860 the ministry of municipal affairs and housing noted there are existing and proposed employment areas on the south side of grand valley which would provide employment opportunities closer to an established settlement
6266861 further the phase 1 report of the dufferin county growth strategy indicates there appears to be sufficient employment lands to meet provincial employment targets although further analysis will be undertaken in later phases
6266862 the most southerly onethird of the proposal would consist of a combination of experimental research farm crops and greenhouse development the greenhouses would utilize the energy including heat produced from the energy from waste facility in order to heat the greenhouses
6266863 the greenhouses represent an intensification of agricultural use on the subject property and result in year round agricultural production as compared to the current limited agricultural production on the property
6266864 we would conclude that the experimental research farm and greenhouse component of the project are supportive of the agricultural economy and supportable from a planning policy context
6266865 the agricultural use of the lands has been limited by insufficient drainage conditions and would require investment in soil drainage to improve its potential as an agricultural resource

6266904 a physicians responsibility is to place the needs of the patient first so there will be times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical services they require

6266926 it wasnt an issue until the beginning of this year when the networks started broadcasting different hd content
6266927 people are now understanding more about what they are missing out on so the issue will just become bigger
6266928 seven and ten did a great job of advertising them their hd channels but we failed as a group to tell consumers that if you invested in an sd product you wont get all the hd channels
6266929 ten did the masters golf only on its hd channel so we had consumers bringing their tvs back because they couldnt see the golf
6266930 we were giving away hd boxes to consumers to appease their perception at the point of sale
6266931 so our concern about education is not the analogue to digital issue but the clarification of what digital tv you buy
6266932 the confusion needs to be eliminated so in terms of labelling not only do we need to state that this product is digital but that if you get hd you get all the channels
6266933 the secret about my business is the broadcasters offering content

6266944 the large number of individual contributors is a clear indication of the kind of deep cactus roots support that gabrielle giffords has

6267016 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device was twice as fast at half the price
6267017 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6267018 the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6267019 defendant expressly warranted that the defective iphone 3g would be twice as fast and would otherwise perform adequately on the 3g standard or protocol
6267020 the defective iphone 3gs do not conform to these express representations because they fail to connect and or adequately maintain a connection to the 3g standard and or protocol

6267025 a defective and dangerous pharmaceutical product avandia which was manufactured marketed distributed and or sold by glaxosmithkline to the general public
6267026 repeated and persistent fraud by misrepresenting concealing and otherwise failing to disclose to physicians and patients information in its control concerning the safety and effectiveness of avandia
6267027 cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in diabetes patients
6267028 thus it is important that an anti diabetic agent reduce or at least not exacerbate the risk of cardiovascular injury
6267029 a safe and effective anti diabetic agent that promised fewer side effects than other similar treatments
6267030 the product warnings for avandia were vague incomplete or otherwise inadequate to alert prescribing physicians as well as consumer patients of the actual risks associated with avandia
6267031 significantly increase risk of heart attacks cardiovascular related deaths strokes or other serious and life threatening conditions which it has concealed from the medical community and patients
6267032 in fact as early as 1999 dr john b buse current president elect of the american diabetes association a diabetes expert and head of endocrinology at the university of north carolina chapel hill raised concerns about avandia and heart problems

6267043 we are not aware of any australians involved in the incident however our embassy in madrid is in contact with local authorities hospitals and the airline to ascertain if any australians are affected a dfat spokeswoman said
6267044 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6267045 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6267046 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6267047 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6267048 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6267049 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6267050 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6267051 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6267052 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6267053 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6267054 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6267055 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6267056 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6267057 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6267058 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6267059 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6267060 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations

6267069 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6267070 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6267071 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6267072 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6267073 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6267074 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed

6267076 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said

6267087 when a company needs to fine tune its strategy or troubleshoot organizational issues the best problem solving solution may have little to do with the problem itself a host of organizations including british airways verizon and nasa have embraced ai a strategy based on the idea that focusing on whats working is a better way to fix whats wrong despite the esoteric sounding name ai is gaining real traction at companies that need to make big or complex organizational changes

6267105 it is okay to choke it is part of human nature to at times feel the pressure of the moment and not perform your best however we perform best under pressure when we minimize the choke factor and the best way to do this is to care about the right things and not the wrong things
6267106 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a veronica movie
6267107 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6267108 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6267109 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6267110 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6267111 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway

6267145 kenny was not afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
6267146 the following day they went out and lost to carlow which is one of the favorite teams losing to one of the lower down teams so it was a bit of an upset
6267147 i wouldnt say i have a 100 percent record in these things but it is great to see kenny doing so well
6267148 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week

6267194 this will include tax cuts and measures to stabilize domestic capital markets and support healthy development of the housing market
6267195 china s top priorities for macroeconomic control in the second half are maintaining stable but rapid economic growth and controlling inflation this is proof that the government has become more cautious on macroeconomic controls and monetary policy won t be so tight in the future

6267198 external demand will continue to weaken and the negative impact on exports economic growth and employment will emerge further
6267199 of course any award or ranking like our inclusion in the inc 5000 is a tremendous accomplishment for actronix
6267200 however making the inc 5000 marks a particularly momentous occasion as five short years ago actronix was cash poor and faced with potential failure the fact that weve been able to rejuvenate this once struggling company to be included in the inc magazines list of the 5000 fastest growing privately held companies is a source of extreme pride for all 300 members of the actronix team

6267215 early on well be trying to incorporate what weve been working on over the spring and while results are important it will not be the only way we measure success
6267216 of course any award or ranking like our inclusion in the inc 5000 is a tremendous accomplishment for actronix
6267217 however making the inc 5000 marks a particularly momentous occasion as five short years ago actronix was cash poor and faced with potential failure the fact that weve been able to rejuvenate this once struggling company to be included in the inc magazines list of the 5000 fastest growing privately held companies is a source of extreme pride for all 300 members of the actronix team

6267229 an attack is coming from within i see churches thinking it is unbelievers causing the problem no folks its believers those who say the name of jesus we are going to be in a big battle its not against non believers toward believers the devil or christ it is gods children going against each other many will turn from worshipping the lord giving the appearance of holiness
6267230 for as a snare it shall come upon all of them who dwell on the face of the whole earth watch therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall soon come to pass and to stand before the son of man
6267231 these catholic powers will overtake the holy a majority of my people will be overtaken and trampled because their lives are not clean before their lord the beast will do battle against the holy

6267243 there are currently 30 patients in isolation at dunedin hospital and three wards are closed to admissions at the hospital
6267244 we are going to continue with some outpatient clinics and procedures tomorrow at dunedin hospital
6267245 the majority of clinics operating will be in areas where physical isolation from the wards can be maintained
6267246 we are starting to increase the number of services that we can provide based on assessment of the clinical urgency of the cases and our ability to continue with our isolation protocols
6267247 however we urge all visitors and patients who do come to the hospital to abide by our hand hygiene enforcements if they do need to be in the hospital

6267257 besides me being really vigilant about it the mri is the number one reason that im going to live if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this or i would have to undergo such much more than i have
6267258 its incredibly expensive so for me one of the things when this all happened was that im putting together a program to pay for mris for women who are at high risk which means women who have had it in their family or know that theyre gene positive
6267259 were also going to pay for the genetic testing because thats very very expensive its upwards of 2 000 to 3 000 so all of that is coming together right now

6267262 this gives credence to the claims that the mystical type experiences some people have during hallucinogen sessions may help patients suffering from cancer related anxiety or depression and may serve as a potential treatment for drug dependence
6267263 while some of our subjects reported strong fear or anxiety for a portion of their day long psilocybin sessions none reported any lingering harmful effects and we didnt observe any clinical evidence of harm
6267264 even at the 14 month follow up 58 percent of 36 volunteers rated the experience on the psilocybin session as among the five most personally meaningful experiences of their lives and 67 percent rated it among the five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives

6267279 i moved to colorado in 1994 and my first day of school in denver it snowed a foot in september

6267285 i fear that far too many canadians are either indifferent or too lazy to bother and simply accept what msm say
6267286 harper has long insisted his decision to stay away from the games had nothing to do with politics but rather with a scheduling conflict canada was represented at the aug 8 opening ceremonies by foreign affairs minister david emerson while secretary of state for sport helena guergis and b c premier gordon campbell also attended
6267287 the first essential characteristic of the olympics both ancient as well as modern is to be a religion it represents above and outside the churches humanitys superior religion
6267288 chretien is just trying to protect maurice strongs business interests in china its no different than harper protecting bushs interests in afghanistan
6267289 why winston that must mean that george w bush is a big ol leftist seeing how he did do exactly what cretien said harper should do

6267293 my philosophy has always been that schools are for kids not board members not administrators not teachers so i want to make sure every dollar gets to the kids
6267294 when all our kids get to the 6th grade campus we need to be sure theyve all gotten the same core curriculum elementary school principals must work closely on this with each other and with curriculum coordinators
6267295 well start with a parent night to get the border patrol in front of parents of 9th grade students and we may move down to the 8th grade too
6267296 then following along we need to make sure the same thing happens at 6th 7th and 8th grades to get kids ready for the freshman campus
6267297 my whole focus is going to be whats best for those kids and creating teamwork here to make that happen

6267313 in the end the plan is probably a good idea
6267314 the government will make all its efforts to support the families in this hard moment as they have received the news of such tragedy
6267315 the plane passed its annual maintenance test on january 24 and up until today no failure was reported as you understand we cannot provide any information as of the cause of this accident at the moment
6267316 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6267317 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6267318 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6267319 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths

6267334 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6267335 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6267336 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6267337 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6267338 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6267339 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6267350 i believe thats an excellent idea that at the provincial level hasnt been done
6267351 identifying these vulnerable areas would be a huge step some work has been done in halifax but nothing around the province
6267352 i couldnt see how there couldnt be a risk because beyond a shadow of a doubt sea levels are rising globally locally here in nova scotia we have both rising sea levels and subsidence as the province sinks
6267353 its a dangerous combination and makes us a vulnerable province because of a lot of our coastline is low lying
6267354 theres some pretty big environmental challenges just over the horizon and we dont have the resources at the provincial or federal levels to deal with them
6267355 once we have identified these vulnerable areas its going to be cost prohibitive to fix them all

6267379 something moved on the wood pile and when i looked i saw this owl sitting there
6267380 i started talking to it and it wasnt flying away
6267381 when i got there i started taking pictures of it and it was calm as could be
6267382 on the way to the vet the owl didnt move at all
6267383 we were able to provide shelter for the owl until the department of natural resources out of oxford picked it up
6267384 the owl seemed to be fine and remained calm when we get animals such as owls in we have isolation cages to keep them in if the animal is upset well keep the room dark and quiet until it calms down but this one was quite cooperative
6267385 he was probably on the ground for a few weeks for the fracture to heal like it did

6267415 innovators feel in any industry when they try to introduce a new idea instead of being thrown a ticker tape parade theyre often met with hostility or indifference sometimes the status quo defeats the innovative concept or at least delays its introduction
6267416 although it may have a slightly higher glam factor than say the insurance business hollywood is a perfect case study for the way that any big successful well established industry responds to new ideas
6267417 though the technology for digital projection was improving the issue of who would pay for what seemed like it might derail digital cinema
6267418 our ten year plan is to be the worlds leader in that but the way to win is not to focus on the technology its to get the customers a couple million subscribers who are addicted to the internet for choosing their movies those are exactly the people who will do downloading its the customer relationship that will be valuable

6267441 an in depth inquiry to avoid such accidents in the future said ms alvarez
6267442 unlike chlorine chloramines cannot be removed from water by boiling or by letting an open container of water stand to dissipate chlorine gas

6267446 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6267447 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6267448 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6267449 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6267450 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6267451 out on the field is where im most comfortable where im the happiest
6267452 for me the training is as important as the games
6267453 to be someone kids look up to is a great honor what matter is how you carry yourself off and on the field
6267454 as previously advised the group 2008 npat is not expected to be above the 2007 group npat of 643 million it said
6267455 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6267456 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6267457 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6267458 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6267459 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6267460 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6267461 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6267462 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6267463 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6267464 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6267465 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown
6267466 vodafone says the phone is selling well and it has run out of stock again
6267467 video calling man come on like seriously how pathetic is that
6267468 i thought i was ocs over the line at the start so when i arrived at the top mark i checked the board to see if i was over i just turned my head to look and lost my balance
6267469 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6267470 i saw nick afterwards and just felt really sorry for him its pretty tough when something like that comes down one race
6267471 hes a friend ive known him for a long time and hes a very good sailor with lots of experience hes had an amazing year
6267472 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to take some time off and think about life
6267473 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6267474 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6267475 this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional
6267476 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution

6267480 oil is almost the solo driver in the foreign exchange market at the moment
6267481 i lose a child that i was so prepared for and for something i could have avoided
6267482 i would not have taken the drugs i would not have breastfed and taken the drug
6267483 i dont think there is a reason to be scared but there is a reason to be informed
6267484 i dont think people should be scared but like many other drugs women and doctors should be aware that something we thought was safe may not be safe
6267485 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6267486 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6267487 sometimes we can process a request in two to four weeks
6267488 but its a big process and we dont always have the adequate amount of information and you have to go back and forth
6267489 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6267490 sounds like one of the dumbest things ive heard from this campaign so far
6267491 an in depth inquiry to avoid such accidents in the future said ms alvarez
6267492 im still trying to fit into those jeans i wore when i was 20
6267493 if you havent worn it in a year get rid of it
6267494 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6267495 we want all our personnel to know that health and security are the companys highest priorities
6267496 we are working with the algerian authorities to ensure the safety of our staff
6267497 he urges once again that the international community support the efforts of the government of algeria to combat terrorism
6267498 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6267499 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6267500 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6267501 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the
6267502 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6267503 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6267504 the poll shows how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
6267505 whatever momentum obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost
6267506 its as if his campaign has stalled a little bit or coasted
6267507 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains very much a part of the election
6267508 do we still have work to do with folks who supported hillary clinton absolutely but weve been able to make great strides
6267509 the vast majority of democrats are moving forward were going to come out of our convention even more unified than we are right now ready to take on john mccain in the fall
6267510 theyve already voted once against barack obama and right now after three months of 20 20 hindsight theyre still not voting for barack obama
6267511 it is our belief that she has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing
6267512 my goals and intentions with the social media analysis and tracking session at ses san jose today
6267513 world of warcrafts developers have mastered the unholy art of in game bribery they have discovered that players will do any number of stupid tedious things in order to earn perks that have no effect on the game
6267514 that just hapens to not work in my house or one of my friends houses
6267515 gt more information on touch diamond and raphael for both sprint and verizon
6267516 but albany i guess thats a good place to vacation
6267517 hopefully we can get all the receivers back and get them healthy just so we can get into the flow of things
6267518 im sure coach coughlin wants me out there every day
6267519 im just happy its not the regular season thats all im saying
6267520 nothing takes the place of those reps in practice when the defense is out there 7 on 7
6267521 hopefully ill be good within a week getting used to everything
6267522 exhibits a distinctive earthy nose of creosote scorched earth pepper spice black cherries and licorice with abundant glycerin power and richness
6267523 well dated isnt technically right i mean we were engaged
6267524 alright but so abby is a slayer and she needs to go into training
6267525 thats correct maam with the large number of current slayers it should be easy for miss sciuto to one day return to her duties here at ncis its just that with her new abilities it is imperative that she goes to london to train
6267526 how long should i mark for abbys leave of absence
6267527 with a forensic scientist of abbys skill it would be great to use her to sort of catalog physical findings on demons and stuff
6267528 most of the similar information we gathered with the initiative was lost at the end
6267529 well we asked some basic questions and based on her previous fighting experience and her level of intelligence i think six months would be good
6267530 good luck abby dont forget to come back well miss you
6267531 just remember director shepard this is confidential and revealing any of the information we just discussed will be considered treason
6267532 you should apologize tony judging by the condition of the skin near the eye patch im pretty sure the eye patch isnt just for fun
6267533 no worries i should have listened to my moms warnings about playing with nail guns
6267534 im going on a sabbatical for six months so i just came to get my stuff
6267535 will you take care of him for me while im gone
6267536 a sabbatical abigail why didnt you tell us you were considering one
6267537 it was a recent opportunity she only found out about it on friday shell be going to london to study with a group of research scientist who specialize in new kinds of physical evidence
6267538 what does homeland security have to do with a forensics sabbatical in england
6267539 sufficed to say a lot of governments will be interested in the results of abbys group
6267540 if you dont mind my saying so this conversation is getting a little strange
6267541 not if that makes you ben because that would make me mrs robinson cause i havent worn a bra since those frat guys made me wear one and i was only there to watch out for cordy and buffy
6267542 its a quote from the graduate you know heres to you mrs robinson
6267543 is he like tony does he always make weird references to movies
6267544 he likes junk food tony is addicted to creamy crisps
6267545 hey wills tony said that gibbs broke six different computers we should introduce him to giles
6267546 he took em down and got some scores he threw some long passes which some of you didnt think he could do
6267547 i think he handled himself very well he was able to pick up blitzes he was elusive and got away from some pressure
6267548 so i think he did a lot of things well
6267549 youre thinking about a thousand things and guys are coming at you a thousand miles an hour
6267550 i think hell be able to slow that down this week and hell be better as a result
6267551 he was getting probably a little more pressure than we expected so he could have done better probably hell tell you that when he gets back out here
6267552 its gonna be a good opportunity im really looking forward to it
6267553 i havent done that in a while i should probably start running
6267554 we enjoy being together and we have a lot of confidence in each other we dont have a whole bunch of individuals its a group of guys working together as a team
6267555 the closer you are the more you can rely on the guy next to you in adversity and count on someone else to get you through that
6267556 hopefully were doing a good job of maintaining a balanced attack
6267557 the x factor is to play good fundamental football and the team that makes the least mistakes will usually come out victorious
6267558 we try to continue to have progress and growth were no different in that situation and we try to make sure that we continue to work on the small things and continue to do the small things the right way if we do that then winning will take care of itself
6267559 theyve done very well for themselves theyre well coached and very well prepared its a great opportunity for us to play against somebody that has winning tradition like that
6267560 the 2005 zinfandel chase vineyard has an intense black cherry and raspberry nose a dark ruby purple tinged color surprisingly full body and depth and is quite a complete wine even in such a difficult vintage
6267561 the lyrics of the song are sexual pertaining particularly to anal sex
6267562 its my last year and i got to play two games last year
6267563 im coming in with a chip on my shoulder and playing every game like its my last its definitely going to help me knowing that i could go down
6267564 i never thought that i could get hurt and my season could be ended now that i know its possible im going out there and going 120 percent im just ready ready to take anything on
6267565 there was a point where we really just felt bad for ourselves and for each other
6267566 we both were sitting on the sidelines at times i remember a time when we were crying when they ran out of the tunnel we really missed out on it
6267567 we trained a lot together in the offseason we told each other that we werent going to let this ruin our football careers
6267568 when i broke my leg my calf was really tight
6267569 i had to get a lot of stimulus to loosen it up a lot of massages and just walking on it a lot of band stretches and balancing it took a long time but it was all worth it coming back
6267570 i think knowing my leg was ok playing baseball where you have to run a lot
6267571 that made it a lot better on me knowing that i would be ok when i came into football at that point i think my leg was about 99 percent i was happy to know i was back
6267572 i wasnt really sure how it was going to feel
6267573 when i go out and playing a game its not going to be in my head
6267574 it was just more about hitting the weight room hard getting my legs back to full go thats basically all im worried about making sure its 100 percent im not going to let it get in my head when i get on the field
6267575 everyone worked hard at their new positions that i gave them
6267576 they showed me that they can play everywhere it gives everybody a chance to play with different people so i can see their strengths and weaknesses at different positions we have well rounded players they enjoyed it we had a good time
6267577 when we play a team like central catholic theyre deep their girls play all year and ours dont
6267578 i thought my first doubles team played especially strong today they had to play smart tennis and they did it my second doubles team did well also theyre coming along i asked them do you think you played well and they all said yes as long as they are improving on their game then theyre playing good tennis
6267579 she got her own house she got her own car got
6267580 she got her own house she got her own car got
6267581 the world trade center attacks mark a deep cut in our recent history that is still being processed
6267582 ambiguous juxtaposition of this mythical game and the historical events of sept 11
6267583 aliens are not going to attack the world trade center what reason would they attack the world trade center that makes no sense at all
6267584 i think hes just using that as an excuse to help promote his game being it comes out so close to the remembrance of the attack
6267585 there arent enough black voters in missouri for barack obama to win it if he cant make things more competitive among white voters
6267586 thats going to be his challenge if he wants to have any chance at winning the state
6267587 absolutely we were last in the world in kickoff returns were emphasizing that
6267588 i dont know that we ever put all of the blocks together that you need to spring one
6267589 its probably a reminder of how good the guy was before
6267590 its not just the returners although thats all that most people ever see
6267591 we need to tighten up we obviously know our numbers have been down and we want to improve on that
6267592 last year we didnt play as well as we could our blocking and other things we could have done better on kickoff returns and things like that so hes stressing those right now
6267593 she got her own house she got her own car got
6267594 i wasnt going to go into the house and give a speech that completely contrasted with the leader at a time where everything i said was always contrasted with the leader as some sort of leadership ploy
6267595 my opinions on climate changes have now changed based purely on scientific evidence
6267596 the scientific consensus is clear human induced climate change is real and its threatening the planet there are some
6267597 this is a complete and utter hoax if i may say so the impact of the kyoto protocol even if one believes in global warming and i am somewhat suspicious of it is that we will see billions and billions of dollars poured into fixing something that we are not even sure is a problem even if it is a problem it will be delayed for about 6 years then it will hit the world in 2096 instead of 2102 or something like that it will not work
6267598 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
6267599 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
6267600 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
6267601 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6267602 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

6267611 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6267612 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6267613 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6267614 i wont make any difference to rupert murdochs bank balance because there are plenty of uninformed sheep out there for his rabidly right wing keeping the populous afraid of their neighbours so theyll vote that way brainwashing agenda for him to fleece of their hard earned tax paying cash
6267615 i cant control what anybody else is going to do im just going to try the greatest race of my life im going out there thursday and run the heck out of my race
6267616 this is a big opportunity to be at the olympic games and now everyone gets to enjoy this crazy little sport
6267617 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6267618 anything more than 25 pounds in 12 weeks is really over stepping the boundaries
6267619 we are looking for girls with a great attitude a pretty face and the endurance to sweat off the pounds during a 3 month boot camp style show
6267620 the great object of my fear is the federal judiciary
6267621 please farah tell me you are not going to say this widely acclaimed 1954 ruling banning racial segregation of schools was wrong
6267622 to make exceptions for government actions that seem right but arent consistent with the constitution is to make arbitrary and quite dangerous distinctions doing so breaks the chains of the constitution that in thomas jeffersons memorable phrase are needed to bind down politicians once we allow the government to go outside the bounds of the constitution we have created a precedent for other extra constitutional actions later
6267623 well it might have been a bad decision but at least some good emerged from it
6267624 always been and remain s strongly opposed to the fairness doctrine
6267625 chairman martin strongly believes that in this day and age when you have literally hundreds of channels with all varying viewpoints available that that is an old archaic outdated policy that serves no purpose in todays market
6267626 nossa a gente n o se v faz tanto tempo ser que vai ser estranho quando nos reencontrarmos
6267627 every player has a comfort level of skating where they know theyre not going to fall down
6267628 we try to push players beyond that comfort level so that when they get in the game there may be a little bit of a drop off but its better than the level they were playing at
6267629 the style of play that we want to instill in our players is we want to play to win the game not play to not lose the game
6267630 its very easy to play and be afraid to make mistakes instead of forcing the play it can be tempting to back off and see what they bring when you do that youre on your heels and youre in chase mode toward your own net instead of chase mode toward the oppositions
6267631 the alliance of the arch capitalist state of the west or even more so of america with the mendacious mock socialist regime of bolshevism is conceivable only because leadership in both cases lies in the hands of international jewry
6267632 now it will be german socialism that will triumph in europe
6267633 mohammed of the allah of scientific socialism was hitler not stalin
6267634 were calling on the rest of the nation to follow suit and make a statement that we will not accept these subtle forms of discrimination
6267635 apparently she and the father had argued over the marriage and the fact that it was arranged and at some point during the altercation he did end up killing his daughter
6267636 i would see the young lady outside every once in a while dressed in the traditional muslim gear
6267637 the father he would pray at certain times of the mornings and evenings
6267638 in 1997 in cairo egypt twenty five year old nora marzouk ahmeds honeymoon ended when her father chopped off her head and carried it down the street now he said the family has regained its honor noras crime she had eloped
6267639 in 2002 in tehran an iranian man cut off his seven year old daughters head after suspecting she had been raped by her uncle the motive behind the killing was to defend my honor fame and dignity some people called for this mans death under islamic law but ironically only the father of the victim can demand the death sentence
6267640 in 1999 in lahore pakistan samia imran was shot dead in her feminist lawyers office by a man whom her parents had hired to kill her
6267641 islamists and conservatives said the laws violated religious traditions and would destroy families and values
6267642 my immediate reaction was that this is an anomaly in the south asian community this isnt a rampant problem within south asian communities what is a problem i think is domestic violence and that cuts across all communities
6267643 such cultural unions serve as social contracts among south asians and other communities where a marriage agreement is more about families joining forces than about two people finding love akin to the arranged marriages of european royalty
6267644 last i checked my history books common europeans didnt go around killing their daughters for marrying wrong and neither did their ages old monarchs
6267645 t he history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle
6267646 i am a liberal and liberalism is the politics of kindness liberals stand for tolerance magnanimity community spirit the defense of the weak against the powerful love of learning freedom of belief art and poetry city life the very things that make america worth dying for
6267647 politics will be so ugly and rancid that decent people will avoid expressing an opinion for fear of being screeched at and hectored and spat on
6267648 human misery is all a fiction something out of novels stories of matchstick people

6267688 years before he had inflicted the unscientific maunderings of das kapital and the dogmas of dialectical materialism on a long suffering world marx called for what had to be accomplished the ruthless destruction of everything existing
6267689 so in 1922 the conspiracy was hatched at the marx engels institute in moscow by karl radek a power in the politburo and the representative of lenin felix djerzhinski head of the soviet secret police georg lukas cultural commissar of the short lived hungarian bolshevik revolution and willi muenzenberg the cominterns organizational genius

6267691 the weakening of marriage has been heterosexuals doing not gays for it is their infidelity divorce rates and single parent families that have wrought social damage
6267692 the problem today is not gay couples wanting to get married
6267693 the threat to marriage is straight couples not wanting to get married or straight couples not staying married
6267694 people who wont censure divorce carry no special weight as defenders of marriage
6267695 divorce is a far more grievous blow to marriage than todays challenge by gays
6267696 commentators miss the point when they oppose homosexual marriage on the grounds that it would undermine traditional understandings of marriage
6267697 it is only because traditional understandings of marriage have already been severely undermined that homosexuals are now laying claim to it
6267698 the world of no strings heterosexual hookups and 50 percent divorce rates preceded gay marriage
6267699 all homosexuals are saying is that under the current definition theres no reason to exclude us if you want to return straight marriage to the 1950s go ahead but until you do the exclusion of gays is simply an anomaly and a denial of basic civil equality

6267722 entramos com a equipe bem ofensiva mas sab amos que t nhamos que ter aten o ali atr s mas jogamos bem e j no primeiro tempo poder amos ter feito mais gols no segundo tempo conseguimos ampliar o que deu mais tranq ilidade
6267723 acho que a partida que a gente realizou no parque antarctica n s mostramos que temos equipe para chegar longe no campeonato a gente conseguiu recarregar as baterias e conseguimos nos recuperar mas temos que ter calma porque temos muita coisa pela frente
6267724 elas erraram menos sacaram melhor e passamos mais um dia triste aqui

6267726 the challenge did not flinch from tackling some of the toughest problems in education it worked in inner cities and isolated rural areas to improve education for children who were most often poor or minorities the challenge did not work miracles but it frequently beat the odds and helped public schools do better the challenge proved that public education can work it was time and money well spent

6267744 i dont think there is a reason to be scared but there is a reason to be informed
6267745 i dont think people should be scared but like many other drugs women and doctors should be aware that something we thought was safe may not be safe
6267746 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6267747 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects

6267750 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything i dont anticipate that they will do that
6267751 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there

6267756 las vegas is the center of unionism in the country everyone is watching because theres a lot of activity going on and all sorts of things happening
6267757 this economic environment is very clearly an opportunity for workers to organize
6267758 if you notice when workers really organize in this country it is during a depression not during good economic times whats going to happen is that all the cuts that companies have done where workers dont have a collective bargaining agreement when the economy gets better and they start rolling around most of the time they dont restore those cuts those cuts become part of the landscape
6267759 sort of de facto abridgement of right to work laws

6267764 a equipe hoje teve outra cara fez um excelente primeiro tempo mas precisava manter no segundo e n o conseguimos futebol assim

6267774 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6267775 i wanted to link business with a message for sexually active people
6267776 i am the brand ambassador for sensation condoms in ethiopia and i want to spread the message that condoms can protect you from hiv aids
6267777 when i walk down the road even children recognise me
6267778 but they do not call me hayat they call me sensation
6267779 we have had young people come in and ask is it true that you actually give free condoms and when we say yes their faces brighten up and they quickly order
6267780 but we have also had people who get shocked when we bring the bill with a condom some saying we are promoting immorality
6267781 it is your choice to take it or leave it
6267782 we also plan to set up condom vending machines in the toilets
6267783 a lot of people in ethiopia are ashamed of talking about or using condoms
6267784 yet some companies put condoms in their toilets and when you go to look each day the boxes are empty i dont care if the condoms are used behind closed doors or in public as long as many people use them
6267785 there are still educated people exposed to hiv and dying of aids
6267786 with the language of the statute and ask whether congress has spoken on the subject before it
6267787 congress has made its intent clear the court must give effect to that intent
6267788 the fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright
6267789 a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law

6267793 we expect to have a decision and will notify the hospital that it has been lifted or the reasons we cant lift it
6267794 its my belief that when an officer makes up facts in a police report its misconduct
6267795 it would lock us into a bad budget year as the new baseline funding year for schools
6267796 any cap based on population will kill seniors over the next couple of decades
6267797 since the growth in the senior population will be triple that of the overall population it will place incredible demands on things like nursing home care and in home support services

6267803 confidence that we can meet our insurance profit target for 2008 of around 20 per cent of net earned premium
6267804 the acquisitions converted to date have enabled us to use a portion of our excess capital
6267805 we are experiencing increased acquisition activity with opportunities being presented in many of the markets in which we operate
6267806 we expect to convert some of these opportunities to optimise our capital and returns to shareholders
6267807 at current exchange rates we now expect gross written premium to be around 12 5 billion and net earned premium to be around 10 8 billion for 2008
6267808 as previously advised the group 2008 npat is not expected to be above the 2007 group npat of 643 million it said
6267809 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6267810 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6267811 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6267812 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6267813 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6267814 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6267815 he will do it and he promised itll be six years from now
6267816 a lot of people keep suggesting i should be going up to 400
6267817 i dont think im going to be doing it anytime soon i dont want to say anything too much because my coach might hear and want me to run it but anything is possible
6267818 he doesnt like running the 400 i know that but when he gets tired of running 200s hell move up for sure he promised me for now he still wants to run faster in the sprints
6267819 if he doesnt see the 400 in jamaica improving he will probably decide to move up himself he will want to put us back on the map
6267820 we keep on doing badly in the 400 and sooner or later hes going to realise that and hes not going to like it then hell move up
6267821 i would advise people dont say that he cant do something because when you say that he cant thats when he will hell prove you wrong that would be my advice to his opponents as well
6267822 i dont know whats in his mind now i never ask him about that but if he says hes going to do something he will i see him every day and watch his progress jamaicas such a small place we are at the same track every single day
6267823 he could do any event and i knew that he didnt like to train for 400s
6267824 i believe the 100 is his best event but he believes the 200 is so who am i to say hes the one whos running it
6267825 this world record means a lot to me ive been dreaming of it since i was knee high its been my love since i was 15 so its close to my heart
6267826 but the 200m has another element which is speed endurance what we dont know is how long he can hold that speed i dont think his training at the moment has enough endurance for that but eventually it will have and then i will be ready to kiss my record goodbye
6267827 he trained like a 400m runner because he was training for the 200 then in the pre competition period he started sprinting to do the 100s hes well prepared
6267828 so it wasnt surprising to me that he broke the record because if he can run 9 69 when he wasnt even running his best event you can imagine whats he going to do running top notch in his favourite distance
6267829 it depends on how much he runs how many races the thing is i dont know with bolt bolt is different
6267830 i mean i used to run and ive seen many great athletes but ive never seen anything like that
6267831 but its going to take me a while to get used to it a lot of things that you think you can do as a planning commissioner you really cant
6267832 i hope to just essentially serve the city for a couple of years and learn to listen to people really well from neighborhoods and people impacted by the city of charlottesville
6267833 we spend a disproportionate amount of our energy and planning efforts on certain areas like the downtown mall and other areas are somewhat neglected
6267834 actually the planning commission comes along at a good time ive spent 35 years learning how to do film
6267835 its a good time to sort of take a break from photography for a little bit im just trying to let the technology phase settle down
6267836 if youre fat and ugly you know anything larger than a size 10 youll feel better if you take our drug
6267837 are you prepared to spend what will come to less than a dollar per year to understand more about the fundamentals of the universe we inhabit
6267838 the spokeswoman says ms clark has accepted an apology from the high commissioner john dauth
6267839 the program is designed to achieve affordable and sustainable mortgage payments for borrowers and increase the value of distressed mortgages by rehabilitating them into performing loans this in turn will maximize value for the fdic as well as improve returns to the creditors of the former indymac bank and to investors in those mortgages
6267840 under the indymac federal program eligible mortgages would be modified into sustainable mortgages permanently capped at the current freddie mac survey rate for conforming mortgages now about 6 5 modifications would be designed to achieve sustainable payments at a 38 percent debt to income dti ratio of principal interest taxes and insurance to reach this metric for affordable payments modifications could adopt a combination of interest rate reductions extended amortization and principal forbearance
6267841 renegotiating terms loan by loan is too costly and time consuming
6267842 he will play as much as we need to have him play
6267843 the thinking is that kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been we need to find out more about troy smith he needs those reps
6267844 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
6267845 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
6267846 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it
6267847 hopefully ill work my way back in there im glad to be back practicing with my teammates and now you just hope things continue to go well
6267848 if mr mizrahi does the same thing with ready to wear as he did with the accessories they could become a ferocious competitor again

6267850 hes so busy im sure not even his agent can get a hold of him
6267851 this is an image that our readers and others will remember
6267852 what struck me was that so many young people thought of growing old abroad
6267853 this is surprising considering we are an asian society where children have lived with their old parents for thousands of years
6267854 the national farmers federation appears to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and opposition spokesman on foreign affairs andrew robb rowing in the exact opposition direction
6267855 i think its time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether theyve got any policy on this
6267856 all i know is farmers organisations are saying to us ever since we came to government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6267857 this is their practical proposal and weve responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years
6267858 were concerned to know about health checks security checks compliance how we make sure theyre going to go back all of the issues you would expect that surround what is a significant and arguably the most significant change in immigration policy weve had in a generation in australia
6267859 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6267860 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6267861 but i think what brendan is referring to is the checks and balances that go on people coming into the country
6267862 we dont want to for instance import the crime problem of port moresby into australia weve got to make sure the checks and balances are correct
6267863 there was a concern of this sort of image of bringing in labour which is essentially of course to be frank about it non white labour to do jobs that people in australia simply didnt want to do
6267864 they didnt want to have a system in australia where you have a second tier of people who come to our country
6267865 iceland to offer offshore offshore drilling licenses for arctic oil

6267886 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6267887 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6267888 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6267889 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6267890 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6267891 we have spoken with other vets in our acquaintance and they likewise had never encountered anything like this
6267892 we began to realise that we had something very special as a result he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost
6267893 yoda is so different that we were concerned that he might be catnapped
6267894 i am happy with the draw because the reaction of the team in the last minute was good that is important
6267895 in the first half we played good football with good style and created a lot of chances to score the team played together
6267896 the only thing i didnt like in the first half was when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot
6267897 we have the authority to tell them that at any event if there is a threat towards the public
6267898 we are also issuing it a warning not to hold such a public forum again
6267899 we expected this to happen and we had already told them that holding an open forum on this issue would invoke this sort of reaction from some groups but they were stubborn
6267900 we live in a multiracial country and we have been able to live peacefully so far because we have been tolerant respectful of the sensitivities of all races and by adhering to the tenets of the federal constitution
6267901 if we dispute these basic ideals it will definitely evoke reaction from other groups so if we were to upset this it will evoke disagreement which can affect our peace and harmony
6267902 apart from legal issues we must focus on humanitarian issues it is important that we realise that r subashini t saravanan and s shamala are real people so these are humanitarian issues we are dealing with
6267903 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
6267904 mr mrs jones before i go one thing i want to mention is that we find that since your friends family and neighbors have not taken the time like you have to learn about all the benefits of coatings which give them a real value advantage over paint they often question our clients decision to buy this coating this is the warning pause and let the client think and respond
6267905 part of the process that the government has started i dont know that they meant to do this but theyve actually opened up a wound in australia where people have started to talk about their problems and so you cant put a lid on that he said
6267906 i think the more people who do this i think its part of the healing process
6267907 its crucial to have a serious drought forum but its crucial that the people are listened to weve had meetings all around the place over wheat and a whole host of issues over the years and over the last few months particularly and the peoples cries and the peoples thoughts have not been listened to
6267908 i have confidence in the minister to be able to deliver to a certain degree
6267909 i mean he doesnt run the whole of government but i know he is pretty passionate about the people behind the scene
6267910 i am not ready to connect to the internet right now
6267911 right now hispanics are four times at a higher risk for developing alzheimers than non hispanic whites
6267912 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6267913 little did obama know his own words would so quickly condemn him
6267914 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6267915 right now hispanics are four times at a higher risk for developing alzheimers than non hispanic whites
6267916 if it doesnt work out i can always get it removed or covered up
6267917 i will let no one question my love for this country
6267918 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries
6267919 fuck her she needs to fucking grow the hell up
6267920 and when she does come to her sences it will be too late
6267921 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6267922 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6267923 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6267924 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6267925 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6267926 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
6267927 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
6267928 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world

6267937 both these major coal mining proposals have been declared significant projects by the coordinator general and will now undergo a rigorous environmental assessment process
6267938 open this region to coal exports for the first time
6267939 i think its growth factor could be enhanced 10 times as soon as the weather warms up
6267940 obviously theres enough nutrient storage in the water system up there for the plant to be grown and if the weather does warm up as it will in the next couple of weeks we may find that the paradise dam storage in the burnett river there may have a major environmental outbreak of salvinia
6267941 here we have a perfect example of what can happen when environmental factors are out of control the recent flush inflows in the upper burnett have obviously pushed the salvinia down so its become a bit of a negative impact on fish passage and also its going to have a negative impact on downstream flows if it hasnt already gone down there
6267942 its not an outbreak its just a normal event we have got biological controls on the river for instance weevils have been introduced and obviously they appreciate warmer weather before they become really active i guess the weeds grow better in warmer weather as well so i guess the position at the moment is that its not unusual and we monitor those things and we have a program in place to take care of the weeds
6267943 i was showing them the box where weve been having problems at where we had to flip the switch for the power to come back on
6267944 if someone comes out and they are taking drugs and win the gold they are robbing me of my gold medal when people do things like that they should be punished for it
6267945 two years from the sport and then back it is pretty easy its for the experts to see what else they can do about it and make the athletes understand they should be given this impression that they will go to jail if they do it
6267946 drugs have been in the sport since before i was born and i cant change it i do not know what a drug looks like what it tastes like or how you feel when you take it
6267947 but athletes who take drugs know it is illegal and they are competing against other athletes who are working very hard
6267948 they are pretty much robbing the other athletes and if i go out there and someone comes out and they are taking drugs and they win the gold they are robbing me of my gold medal
6267949 to see the fastest people in the world coming from one island jamaica im highly suspicious

6267952 the united states won the battle of ideologies in 1989 but its global power was only a temporary thing as is becoming clearer every day

6267961 the thing i hope is that the russian and the american who will be upgraded get their medals in a proper presentation otherwise they will have lost that moment forever
6267962 the united states won the battle of ideologies in 1989 but its global power was only a temporary thing as is becoming clearer every day

6267968 i dont think anyones trading any fundamentals on coal weve broken the bull trend now and we have to consolidate until we establish what the next trend is
6267969 because of the high numbers and the big price moves weve had the consolidation is going to be extremely volatile and quite lengthy until it settles
6267970 the market is definitely looking for direction and new inputs to trade
6267971 i have recommended the change and the issue is currently being deliberated at the finance ministry

6267994 the muslim members of our team did their best to pray five times a day they looked for certain breaks in our patrols rather than sticking to a rigid schedule the series of prayers they conducted while we were out in the field usually only took about five minutes but it seemed to me they were always praying whenever we had a few minutes to spare this commitment awed me it was difficult for me to stick to doing even one thing a day consistently writing in my journal for example at the same time other practitioners of islam were committing horrible crimes against the black population i wondered how people in any radical group so close to prayer so constantly conscious of god could reconcile the act of murder and other violence in their religions name the complexity of the conflict and its relationship to religion baffled me

6268105 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6268106 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us
6268107 the west saved the capital they were moving to tbilisi there was one night that was very dangerous the russian tanks were very close to the capital i dont know what happened but they moved the tanks back
6268108 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
6268109 came to me as a vision in september 2007 while walking down the highway of tears route 16 between prince rupert and prince george where 44 aboriginal women have gone missing or been found murdered for the second anniversary of my missing niece tamara lynn chipman who disappeared without a trace after her disappearance i started researching on line and contacting the many family members who have lost their loved ones on this treacherous highway our data base has increased to over 3000 women and children murdered or still missing across the country

6268122 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6268123 i wasnt going to go as high as i wanted to go
6268124 i probably would have gone in the first round but it wouldnt have been as high as i wanted if i came back this year i could probably do better and go higher so thats the reason i came back
6268125 yeah i think so because coach roy williams talked to larry bird and they were real high on me i was either going to be the no 1 or no 2 pick on their draft board theyve had a lot of problems with things like that like with jamaal tinsley and jermaine oneal there were a couple of people that he named so he called and said that they just couldnt take a chance
6268126 you live and you learn and you go through things
6268127 maybe it happened for a reason i cant go back and think about it now you cant change things so im just looking forward
6268128 he said i was already punished by larry bird and him calling indiana and not being able to go to the league so i dont think ill be punished further
6268129 probably maybe one sprint or a couple of sprints but not too much he said
6268130 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours

6268141 what real skin in the game does the developer have here
6268142 they dont have to build the project they can walk away the timetables pretty loose they have up to four years to decide to move ahead and are able to move ahead with really no risk on their part
6268143 i personally feel downtown louisville is a more attractive site than that and that at some point when the arena opens well be able to attract private investment without quite such a rich package of giving away our whole economic development budget for the year to one private developer

6268199 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6268200 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6268201 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6268202 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6268203 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
6268204 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6268205 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6268206 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6268207 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6268208 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6268209 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6268210 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6268211 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6268212 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6268213 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6268214 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6268215 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6268216 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6268217 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
6268218 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
6268219 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
6268220 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
6268221 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
6268222 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
6268223 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
6268224 patterns of suspicious activity in the us consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york
6268225 it is the secret service who has the legal mandate to take supreme command in case of a scheduled major event or an unplanned major emergency on american soil these are designated

6268248 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain the company said
6268249 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6268250 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy he said
6268251 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares he said
6268252 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions mr dixon said
6268253 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories
6268254 we will however continue to invest in new stores and the expansion of our existing stores with a view to delivering further growth in returns to our shareholders
6268255 our sales performance is particularly pleasing as it was achieved in a tougher market and against double digit growth in the previous year mr moir said
6268256 we opened five new stores expanded four existing stores and continued rolling out new fitout concepts in both myer and david jones
6268257 in carefully calibrated public statements and blunter private acknowledgments about the limits of american leverage over general musharraf the officials argued that it would be counterproductive to let pakistans political turmoil interfere with their best hope of ousting central leadership and the taliban from the countrys mountainous tribal areas

6268328 weve now learned that the path of globalization runs in both directions
6268329 im reading all this b s that theres going to be an exodus the nbas not going to lose any great players
6268330 i think it benefits the nba in the long run that europe is interested in these young players and is willing to pay them
6268331 if this plan for globalization of the nba comes to pass there are already players over there
6268332 great basketball is great basketball whether its america europe or asia
6268333 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down
6268334 theyve got horns whistles and fires up in the stands they throw coins and lighters its great competition i just cant see these superstars doing it
6268335 first of all i think kobe and lebron have too much time on their hands
6268336 these guys want to be the best players in the world
6268337 i hope so before he got hurt he was pitching lights out
6268338 love to have him back tommy wants to end his career on his own terms
6268339 nobody wants to be forced to the sideline because of injury and he hasnt been able to produce this year because his arm hasnt been sound
6268340 i think theyll probably give him a look give him an opportunity this teams hurting for arms
6268341 i think most guys as they reach the end of their career are looking for that one last standout moment before they ride off into the sunset
6268342 hopefully if he can get this fixed and get back shoot itd be great
6268343 mccain is the republican maverick and giuliani comes from that brand as well

6268352 across all the business units there are extensive programs in place to help ensure the momentum of the past 18 months continues into the current year mr mckenzie said
6268353 there is evidence however that global economies are slowing and this could impact the growth in sales
6268354 inflationary pressures are increasing with the impact of higher oil prices flowing through to input costs and higher cost inflation in most countries mr mckenzie said
6268355 the profit after tax of 369 million was a solid result given the negative impact on earnings of the strong australian dollar chief executive ken mckenzie said
6268356 earnings are anticipated to improve in the current year however growth will be substantially lower than the 29
6268357 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6268358 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6268359 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6268360 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6268361 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6268362 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed

6268377 no bar nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like apple soho has
6268378 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6268379 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6268380 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6268381 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment

6268397 digital printing is the process by which printed materials are produced on a laser printer ink jet printer or dye sub printer digital printing is different from traditional printing methods like offset printing in that there is no transfer of ink from a printing plate to the paper your desktop inkjet printer at home is considered a form of digital printing albeit a primitive form digital printers generally use toner instead of ink so colors arent quite as vibrant on a digital printer its important to know the basics about digital printing for any kind of printing you do from poster printing to brochure printing digital printing is usually cheaper than offset printing so knowing what kind of projects you can use digital printing for can save you money when you should use digital printing generally you should consider using digital printing when you have a small print job of less than 100 pieces you dont have to pay for the set up fees that are associated with offset printing and you most likely wont need the printer to save what would have been your printing plate when you print small jobs a small run of 50 dinner menus in black ink will cost about 300 less if you print them digitally rather than traditionally you should also use digital printing for text only projects if you have color photos in your brochures youd be better off with offset printing digital printers can certainly print color photos but the photos wont be as sharp and the colors wont be as saturated as they would be with an offset printer photo considerations if you have a small print job you can try to find a printer with a di direct imaging press these small digital presses use ink instead of toner the downside of using this kind of press is that you cant print items that are bigger than approximately 14

6268405 four invariant stages of cognitive development that are age related
6268406 she arlin contends that formal thought actually consists of two distinct stages not one as piaget proposed
6268407 closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her social role
6268408 the ability to think critically which is mandatory to effecting a transformation is itself developmental
6268409 that it is not clear whether knowles had presented a theory of learning or a theory of teaching whether adult learning was different from child learning and whether there was a theory at all perhaps these were just principles of good practice
6268410 within companies instructional methods are designed for improving adult learners knowledge and skills it is important to distinguish the unique attributes of adult learners so as to be better able to incorporate the principles of adult learning in the design of instruction
6268411 expertise in the recognition and classification of the numerous species the flora and fauna of his or her environment
6268412 in sternbergs general theory there are three subtheories the componential subtheory the experiential subtheory and the contextual subtheory each divided into subdomains of concern the contextual subtheory deals with the context of intelligence intelligence in the real world requiring adaptation selection and or shaping the environment measurement of contextual intelligence would relate to the issue of social perception culture fairness and cultural relativeness the experiential subtheory deals with the issue of novelty and automatizing of processing it is related to the notion of learning and the dynamic interplay between controlled and automated processing in the competition for cognitive resources finally there is the componential subtheory which is subdivided into a metacomponents b performance components and c knowledge acquisition components which are directly related to learning
6268413 the learning capabilities of organizational members are at least in part socially constructed by national occupational or other institutions
6268414 pleasant outcomes successes reinforce stimulus response links whereas unpleasant outcomes failures break stimulus response links as a result pleasant outcomes are much more effective at teaching new behaviors
6268415 a key question is how long organizational learning processes take and whether the duration can be externally influenced
6268416 time pressure can both accelerate and slow down learning processes is experienced as motivating or threatening if the sense of threat becomes too excessive however learning can be slowed or made impossible altogether

6268421 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
6268422 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
6268423 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
6268424 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
6268425 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
6268426 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
6268427 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
6268428 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
6268429 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
6268430 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
6268431 in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6268432 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6268433 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6268434 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6268435 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6268436 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
6268437 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws
6268438 we hope you learn from the past and we are going to take care of you
6268439 we have to fix his mind and change his emotions in order to directly change his behavior
6268440 very few i am sure less than 5 percent if its not 1 percent
6268441 if we dont have these efforts you might see 5 000 arrested instead of 500
6268442 certain issues that encourage the guys to be extremists are under our ability
6268443 a religious adviser speaks with you and asks you what you believe and they discuss with you on what basis you believe in that and they try to change your mind by convincing
6268444 its helped so many guys in the prison they like it a lot
6268445 our main goal is to open their minds and to correct their thoughts
6268446 we teach them to be in the middle of islam
6268447 everyone who went to mosque was noted down and targeted as extremist
6268448 the law enforcement agencies have compiled lists of so called adherents of wahhabism including practically all young mosque goers
6268449 every one of these 400 people is under round the clock surveillance and the law enforcement agencies are ready to take any measures against them including physical elimination
6268450 having lengthened the list many times began an active campaign against completely innocent muslims who frequented mosques under the guise of battling against religious extremism
6268451 in this way our truly believing upright and selfless sons were recorded as wahhabis
6268452 i dont go to mosque dont fast dont practise daily prayers its absolutely clear to me that the people on this list have been registered according to the principles of the nkvd stalinist secret police
6268453 and there were none there were some local police lists not of wahhabis unofficial documents
6268454 note down who was there and watch who goes there as part of routine and so people began talking about lists
6268455 we were all on a list so he ended up being a car mechanic
6268456 even then the special services found out and told his boss to get rid of that muslim unless you want problems
6268457 of course im on their list as a potential mujahid muslim warrior
6268458 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6268459 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
6268460 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6268461 my first priority is to win every davis cup tie and if lleyton was fit he would obviously be there
6268462 but it is going to be a potential step up for someone it is something that has been coming for a while
6268463 who knows what could happen and how they will react some react very positively and some struggle but you dont know until you test them
6268464 the most important thing at the moment is for australia to bring along their best young players
6268465 bernard and carsten and brydan are great young players and it is a terrific thing that one or two of them could get a chance as harry hopman used to blood young players in davis cup
6268466 in the days of hopman he used to bring along players of potential and give them a chance to play at the earliest opportunity
6268467 they are more likely to create an impact and do great things than more senior players because they are not battle scarred by a series of losses

6268470 hes been a lot of help to me ever since he went down
6268471 hes definitely on my back all the time its starting to get annoying hes in my ear more than secondary coach dave campo more than the coach
6268472 that shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that
6268473 the day he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he has stayed on me ever since then
6268474 he has great feet good technique its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there
6268475 once he does that hes going to be one of the best corners in the league
6268476 it makes me feel real good a receiver of that caliber praising me and just saying good things
6268477 definitely it makes me want to go out there and work hard it shows a lot of people are believing in me not just on the defensive side it builds up my confidence more than it is
6268478 i learned after the game when i got schooled on that in the end zone that once the quarterback rolls out of the pocket i can pretty much steer the receiver where i want to
6268479 on some players youd worry because he didnt start out well in the game had some problems
6268480 but mike jenkins is a competitor he keeps competing and he doesnt get down on himself he has some confidence
6268481 i think it was good he played against top competition and had some troubles because then he can go back and look at it

6268484 there are a few things behind the scenes about why we went with 11 pitchers
6268485 i always worry about it always because i dont like to overuse guys but we have the day off here and there and we were able to bring the guy from the minor leagues left hander clayton richard
6268486 i dont want to lose a position player i have to pinch run for a couple of guys with the game on the line and i need those guys out there good thing we play well and i dont have to use those guys that much its hard for me to only carry 11 pitchers
6268487 it really feels like a dream right now that i dont want to wake up from
6268488 in certain lineups griffey has been hitting behind me and its an absolute honor to be in the same lineup with those guys
6268489 its an honor to be mentioned in that type of discussion
6268490 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6268491 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6268492 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6268493 your neighbors your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
6268494 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
6268495 acting in a way likely to be publicly embarrassing to the debtor

6268513 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6268514 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6268515 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6268516 this is my house you cant tell me where to live
6268517 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6268518 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6268519 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6268520 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6268521 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6268522 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6268523 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6268524 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6268525 as deep as human history and as wide as the world community
6268526 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6268527 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6268528 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6268529 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6268530 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6268531 as ever with sonys cyber shot range the dsc w300 is as much about style as substance the metal build quality suggests this is a camera that youll still be using a few years down the line a feeling backed up by that whopping 13 megapixel resolution plus its plentifully large and bright rear lcd look back at a camera from four or five years ago when 1 5 inches was the norm and find a product looking positively prehistoric unfortunately though while images appear fine when viewed in isolation anyone who has handled a wide variety of digital compacts as us reviewers are privileged to do will discover that image quality is perhaps the least impressive aspect of the w300 thats a shame as among its bridge cameras im thinking of the h50 and dslrs alpha 350 at the mid range sony has delivered some surprisingly impressive photographic models of late all that being said noise is handled very well and shots do require a minimal amount of post processing out of the camera so in that respect the sony cyber shot dsc w300 could be said to be ideally suited to its target market of the undemanding snapper who requires visual aide memoirs delivered with the minimum of fuss
6268532 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6268533 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6268534 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6268535 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6268536 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6268537 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6268538 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6268539 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6268540 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6268541 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6268542 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6268543 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6268544 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6268545 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6268546 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6268547 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6268548 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6268549 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6268550 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6268551 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6268552 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6268553 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6268554 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6268555 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6268556 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6268557 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6268558 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6268559 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6268560 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6268561 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6268562 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6268563 who are open to doing something on the production side
6268564 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6268565 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6268566 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6268567 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6268568 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6268569 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6268570 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6268571 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6268572 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6268573 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6268574 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6268575 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6268576 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6268577 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6268578 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6268579 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6268580 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6268581 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6268582 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6268583 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6268584 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6268585 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6268586 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6268587 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6268588 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6268589 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6268590 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6268591 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6268592 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6268593 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6268594 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6268595 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6268596 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6268597 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6268598 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6268599 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6268600 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6268601 for heavens sake discard the monstrous wig which makes the english judges look like rats peeping through bunches of oakum
6268602 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6268603 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6268604 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6268605 i think he knows how to reach across party lines the same way barack obama does
6268606 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6268607 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment

6268616 it is the greatest scam in history i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create in allusion sic of rapid global warming other scientists of the same environment whacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the research to further enhance the totally slanted bogus global warming claims their friends in government steered huge research grants their way to keep the movement going soon they claimed to be a consensus
6268617 the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic caused by humans co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
6268618 in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects worldwide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun

6268657 the chinese are very competitive they are well disciplined algeria has saved time by granting chinese companies contracts to carry out some projects
6268658 the chinese are taking advantage of the absence of european companies for example the majority of dams and housing units are being built by chinese investors they would not have been assigned those projects if they had western competitors here
6268659 some chinese people in algeria have started promoting their countrys products several shops have been opened to sell chinese cloth this phenomenon is new for us we are waiting to see the outcome of this invasion
6268660 nowadays the chinese communities are in every african country the plan is to take some of its population and put them in africa while africans just look on and african leaders hold fruitless meetings
6268661 business is good our wares are cheap cheaper than the moroccans sell and that is what the people want the moroccans sell the same bags as us but for 40 dirhams 5 4 we sell them for 25 i have a house in china and a house in morocco i can be frustrated in guangzhou or frustrated in casablanca it makes no difference to me
6268662 the chinese make 3 dirhams on the items they sell the moroccans want to earn 10 dirhams they chinese are the cheapest and thats what makes their reputation
6268663 the chinese have smashed prices and theres no more margin everyone knows how they work morocco is a poor country so the chinese presence is good for people who find it hard to make ends meet but the quality of what they sell is not great
6268664 the problem is my moroccan competitors now buy from china i went there myself many times but what they were selling didnt interest me my goods are better quality with a superior finish
6268665 to be frank the chinese influx is a menace to this country i think we have to look at it afresh we dont say dont come let those whose expertise is not available come
6268666 they take over jobs that should be done by the locals for example in the construction sector where you find the majority of the chinese you would find people like supervisors masons and carpenters being employed
6268667 we consider this very unfair we feel it is a situation where tanzanians are being denied
6268668 the policy of the tanzanian government is to employ foreigners who will offer training to tanzanians but the tendency we have seen is that many end up here on a long term basis
6268669 our employees demand their labor rights to work for eight hours in a day but the chinese laborers can work for 12 hours without complaining so they chinese firms prefer to use their people claiming they have some deadlines to meet
6268670 the chinese have the technology the speed and they are cost effective the uk finds it cost effective to use the chinese for construction so why should we be left behind we better fly with the rest of the world

6268689 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans

6268695 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
6268696 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
6268697 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
6268698 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed

6268700 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
6268701 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
6268702 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
6268703 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
6268704 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

6268855 we were also loosely inspired by a happening by the theatre personality petr lorenc who in 1997 distributed without paying a fee several hundred advertising posters for his fictitious hypermarket gigadiga
6268856 gigadiga opened at a time when hypermarkets became part of our lives in the course of a mere five years foreign investors built 126 of them in it took them quarter of a century the czechs started shopping in these hypermarkets more than people in the other post socialist countries and the new edition of the czech dictionary of neologisms features words like hypermarketom nie a pathological addiction to shopping in hypermarkets the worship of hypermarkets we were mesmerised by petr s happening because it didnt strive to comprehend the problem intellectually but rather poetically we resolved to undertake a subversive penetration into a world that an ordinary person usually doesnt have a chance to enter the playground of the ceos of international corporations marketing consultants creative consultants but also politicians i e a group of people that has a serious impact on the environment we live in we wanted the viewer to take a look backstage where all those advertising images and these slogans full of freshness joy and happiness are produced we commissioned a campaign to promote nothing for something nonexistent in reality if you like and we were curious to see what the advertising business was going to make of that challenge similarly as with judo we used the strength of advertising so that its weight was used against its bearer
6268857 we were born in an advertisement free country with communist propaganda all over the place and then it turned the other way around perhaps the author of the red slogan of the 1980s sovetsk svaz m rov hr z
6268858 we had to work with a renowned pr agency which developed a defensive strategy in case all hell broke out
6268859 at the time when two czech dailies wrote that czech dream was a fraud that it was owned by czech television and that the ad campaign cost hundreds of thousands of crowns our pr agency issued a statement and forced the media to publish it we claimed for instance that the campaign did not cost hundreds of thousands but millions or that we were not owned by czech tv we learned by first hand experience that the defensive strategy works
6268860 its horrifying to go on a tour of a czech branch of tescos a european hypermarket chain and realize that soon people will literally live their life out in hypermarkets born in their hospitals clothed and fed and housed by them and finally buried by them
6268861 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
6268862 a growing body of academic research indicates that foreign direct investment fdi can be quite sensitive to the corporate tax rates imposed by a state or country one recent study of the effects of corporate income taxes on the location of foreign direct investment fdi in the found a strong relationship between state corporate tax rates and fdi for every 1 percent increase in a states corporate tax rate fdi can be expected to fall by 1 percent a new study of income tax rates in 85 countries by economists at the world bank and university found a strong effect of both statutory and effective corporate tax rates on fdi as well as entrepreneurship for example the average rate of fdi as a share of gdp is 3 36 percent but a 10 percentage point increase in the statutory corporate rate can be expected to reduce fdi by nearly 2 percentage points

6268864 youd see micro spacecraft mainly in communications instead of companies sharing a large satellite you could have even small companies getting their own micro spacecraft for the military undetectability is also important either for surveillance applications or when it comes to zapping other satellites when it comes to a spacecraft less than 5 kilograms 10 pounds you cant really detect it unless its within a quarter of a mile of you larger spacecraft can be detected from farther and consequently blasted out of the sky

6268872 the sba and department of navy have a unique opportunity to create opportunities for 8 a companies and help them develop and become viable in the federal contracting arena an integral part of the business development assistance provided by the 8 a program

6268876 techniques perfected by behavioral scientists to change our core beliefs aimed at sowing confusion in the minds of those who would oppose such change this confusion is created by presenting logical contradictions as equally plausible valid and actionable those without a strong belief system be it empirical scientific religious or logical are especially susceptible to the urgings of those who seek change those who have strong enough belief systems that enable them to challenge refute and oppose this change are coerced by small group encounter techniques to conform to the majority view as determined and sown by a facilitator and supported by the core group of believers plus the newly recruited sheep who join the majority group for fear of confrontation if the challenger does not conform to the group pressure to adopt the consensus view he is further isolated from the group and or discarded he is never allowed to participate fully in the process thereafter

6268883 i suggest that business owners arrange your customers in a b c d order a list of your best most profitable customers would be your a list those who do less business or are more of a problem are ranked accordingly in a lesser category
6268884 the danger of this is being inflexible customers and businesses are never stagnant a business can grow and become a good customer and move up your list if you are going to use this method then be prepared to re evaluate your customers periodically

6268897 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
6268898 the price in the federal reserve is about 2 plus percent in the capital markets its four times as high

6268926 by working to change the definition of a small business for government contracts from 500 to 100 employees federal contracts specifically designed to ensure the success of american small business would go where they belong to support americans not big companies dressed in sheeps clothing
6268927 we found that many of the 55 commits nexgen contractors have grown significantly or have been acquired by larger businesses and may no longer meet small business size standards we also found that a significant portion of the task orders intended for the smallest contractors were issued to larger incumbent contractors
6268928 of the top 1 000 small business contractors in fy 2002 eagle eye publishers analysis found 44 parent companies it identified as either large firms or other contracts to these two groups taken together had a total value of 2 billion
6268929 the department of defense and the general services administration accounted for 79 percent of the contract awards found to have gone to large businesses
6268930 as a result of this lack of transparency many awards that should be reserved for small firms go to large firms unchallenged
6268931 sba did not review the majority of reported bundled contracts that we identified though procuring activities must provide and sba must review proposed bundled acquisitions as a result 192 contracts identified by procuring agencies as bundled were awarded without sbas review if all of these are actually bundled contracts a minimum of 384 million would be potentially lost to eligible small businesses based on minimum dollar reporting requirements of 2 million
6268932 though sba delegated 8 a bd contract execution authority to 26 procuring agencies sba did not ensure that procuring agencies monitored whether companies complied with 8 a bd regulations when completing 8 a bd contracts sba has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that companies comply with 8 a bd regulations

6268997 what has been happening this year especially with the free agents you are starting to see guys who are using overseas as another option
6268998 to me personally i think it is a beautiful thing that people from all over the world and players from all over the world have a chance to play in the nba and players over here a chance to play in europe kobe bryant mentioning or considering playing overseas if everything was right i think it totally changes the whole landscape of basketball
6268999 i know growing up my dream was to play in the nba hands down it wasnt about the money
6269000 once you get to the nba things begin to change it becomes more of a business when you hear players as big as the kobes and lebrons talking about the possibility of playing overseas it shows it is more of a business now they are just not basketball players now they are businessmen so they have to think from a different aspect

6269022 we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6269023 yes the economy is going to be experiencing challenges and other economic factors demonstrate signs of a coming struggle
6269024 however there are some positive signs in the retail sector that show the strength of the industry
6269025 with the economy showing signs of cracking and the real estate marketplace entering a tough period over the next couple of years it is absolutely astounding to witness the retail transactions that have been taking place in the past several years in the meatpacking district and the deals that continue apace
6269026 where store rents were well below 100 a square foot less than five years ago in this west village west chelsea submarket the rents along west 14th street and the surrounding blocks in this vibrant manhattan neighborhood are now eye popping
6269027 national as well as international retailers driving up rents to unheard of levels
6269028 the apple store that taconic investment partners brought to their highly visible corner property and opened in the past year has continued to fuel the trend of major recognizable brands such as hugo boss and moschino arriving in this particular neighborhood
6269029 manhattan has displayed extraordinary resiliency due to its connection with the international community visitors have been a key driver of the manhattan retail market for several years and the ratio of retail space per capita in new york city is approximately one third of the national average
6269030 retail is the economic engine of the real estate sector that is still firing on all cylinders
6269031 this is true throughout all the boroughs and marketplaces of new york city
6269032 rezoning has resulted in the opportunity to take former manufacturing space and create retail strip centers and big box stores that have long tried to enter our marketplace the same rezoning initiatives have created thousands of units of new housing and all these new residents need a place to shop
6269033 the retailers who will survive this market are those who are creative and forward thinking one of the latest trends is retailers combining their stores with a complimentary merchant similar to what barnes amp noble did with starbucks an increasing number of retailers are pairing up with a suitable use and sharing the space and expenses one example is ice cream retailer cold stone creamery partnering with original soup man
6269034 for the most part landlords are positive and open minded to doing deals at a slightly more flexible rent but at the long term advantage of not being vacant
6269035 with the changes that are being contemplated at the lord amp taylor site we are seeing record rent deals with substantial tenants
6269036 broadway in soho is continuing to command increasingly higher rents maybe it is top shop or madewell but what in the past was not traditionally considered prime now anything below broome street can command rents in excess of 500 per square foot if the retail location is on important cross streets such as prince and spring streets rents may be similar to shops along madison avenue
6269037 soho continues to improve and is an area where international demand and recognition continues to grow as deals are still getting done at benchmark pricing levels
6269038 its cheaper than producing it here at home a governmental war on energy imports will by definition raise energy prices

6269042 the most massive peacetime commitment of funds to develop americas own alternative
6269043 provides less than one tenth of 1 of the total energy consumed in the united states
6269044 anyone who develops such a device will earn profits dwarfing 300 million simply by selling it on the market theres absolutely no need for any such taxpayer funded prize
6269045 it is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it better buy it of them
6269046 if we have free access to rest of the world maybe we can talk about reducing our cap a little bit

6269099 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6269100 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6269101 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6269102 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6269103 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6269104 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6269105 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6269106 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6269107 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6269108 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6269109 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6269112 he urges once again that the international community support the efforts of the government of algeria to combat terrorism
6269113 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6269114 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6269115 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6269116 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6269117 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6269118 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures

6269128 i cant control what anybody else is going to do im just going to try the greatest race of my life im going out there thursday and run the heck out of my race
6269129 this is a big opportunity to be at the olympic games and now everyone gets to enjoy this crazy little sport
6269130 there has been a great deal of excitement around the launch of cosmotv and the audience reaction to the channel has already more than delivered on our expectations
6269131 we are really pleased that cosmotv will now be available to even more women across canada cosmotv builds on corus entertainments growing portfolio of women focused brands including canadas 1 specialty channel for women w network that offer canadian women the services programs and the entertainment they are looking for at every stage of their lives
6269132 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6269133 there are a lot of great coffee buyers who dont have this certification but the amount of coffees were tasting you do need a system it serves as a huge benefit to be able to buy efficiently and effectively
6269134 im qualified to say its not the grade we requested or its better
6269135 individuals who cup and grade coffee in large measure determine the prices paid for the coffees they evaluate
6269136 its like having an outside realtor someone whos trained in appraising value who gives an opinion about what a particular propertys worth
6269137 but dont necessarily pay for other certifications like organic or fair trade
6269138 it could be three coffees from the same region of colombia but ones from a different farm
6269139 you have to get five out of six sets to get it right
6269140 you do it in your daily job and understand it or you dont
6269141 youve got the right amount of taste buds or you dont and youre in touch with them or youre not
6269142 to be honest and trust myself i taste everything better now im a better wine taster and food taster because i can trust im tasting what im tasting and am able to communicate that to other people
6269143 it doesnt change the way we purchase roast or blend coffee but it validates our ability to taste coffee or buy it
6269144 its important because it validates me as a well rounded coffee professional
6269145 for intelligentsia its important because it says the people who we have tasting and grading coffees they understand it
6269146 all customers know is if they like it or dont like it
6269147 the sealed envelopes containing the names of mm and dd be opened and be made available for public inspection
6269148 right now they owe me i think they should have a statue of me in the tax office
6269149 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
6269150 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
6269151 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
6269152 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
6269153 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
6269154 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
6269155 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
6269156 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
6269157 i thought she was katrina kaifs sister but it turns out they are not related the resemblance is uncanny
6269158 it is one of my big releases i went to a few theatres and saw some reactions and im very pleased with it
6269159 i am very excited about the show this is the first time that saif and i are performing together i have got a huge fan following in dubai because of jab we met
6269160 el gobierno debi consultar a los nativos amaz nicos sobre los alcances la ley de la selva
6269161 el principal responsable de todo lo que viene ocurriendo es el gobierno que no solicit la posici n de los actores interesados en este tema lejos de propiciar el di logo lo que hace el estado es reprimir a trav s de la declaratoria de emergencia
6269162 vivo como si fuera un recluso nadie sabe quien soy
6269163 fue muy breve hablamos tan s lo unos minutos era como una reuni n con un desconocido
6269164 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6269165 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6269166 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6269167 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6269168 a group of twin cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 republican national convention in st paul
6269169 weve been painted in that bad light being compared to terrorist attacks on the xcel energy center or chemical weapons or other forms of violence that we are criticized for
6269170 its important for people to know we are not as scary as people make us out to be
6269171 our tactics are not terroristic if anything i would call them empowering
6269172 all that means is you are going to stay in an intersection or a place and not leave when the police ask them to leave
6269173 essentially anything that will stop or slow down traffic in this case the traffic of the delegates could be considered a blockade
6269174 engage in nonviolent civil disobedience peacefully preventing the delegates access the xcel center
6269175 its not part of it but we do know there are people who follow the philosophy that some property supports violence and enables violence to happen
6269176 there really is an open debate about it we are just glad this debate can happen and that people can be a part of that debate
6269177 we dont want to say that we condone property violence or that we support it but we also dont want to say we are against it as well
6269178 anarchism is easily the most understood pol theory in america today so much so that newspapers use the silly phrase self described anarchists
6269179 the media says direct action is synonymous with violence that anarchism is the philosophy with the end goal of chaos and disorder
6269180 i think the key issue is people taking control of their own lives rather than offering up their compliance by being satisfied by giving someone else control of it
6269181 a lot of people out there who dont know what an anarchist is might be an anarchist themselves if they look into it a bit its more about creating an environment and community where cooperation is essentially what keeps a community running not coercion
6269182 its very community based knowing who your neighbors are anarchy doesnt mean chaos in the streets breaking windows all these misconceptions a lot of what we do is community based everyone on an equal level with one another
6269183 it isnt about creating something big but making things smaller making communities smaller revolution should be the byproduct
6269184 its essentially a huge dog and pony show sponsored by some of the worst corporations you could think of where lobbyists pay for access to high level politicians
6269185 direct action has been a part of just about any effective political movement throughout history
6269186 we dont think the political elite will stop if we ask nicely
6269187 people are being picked up at the airport and disappearing the organic cause of the eritrean crisis is the present one party dictatorship our puny tyrant is doing it
6269188 we considered ourselves so special so different instead of putting our faith in the rule of law we put it in a man who is weak and flawed like the rest of us
6269189 the fact is that there has been a lot of progress under the government they have built 500 hospitals put in paved roads reduced malaria deaths by 40 percent and built small dams and electrification projects in rural areas
6269190 did that make him a great leader yes there are new schools but who is attending them there are 197 000 eritrean refugees in sudan and who is responsible for that
6269191 you dont expect certain people to just show up to eat
6269192 but you include the entire district so you have to consider the dietary needs of everyone at the table as well as the benefits of the meal
6269193 there is no funding stream for intervention and no resources for prevention we need to find ways to get people refinanced galvanize key stakeholders around these issues and make sure a true agenda is at the table
6269194 uproot those who are poor and push them out to suburban areas or economically harsh places
6269195 i will make sure that people in north minneapolis have priority when those opportunities come forth
6269196 i plan to work with the school board to regain confidence in schools its a question of trust and we need to find ways to make sure that trust is invigorated and identify where weve fallen short
6269197 we dont have the resources to handle the well documented achievement gap so why dont we make businesses accountable to invest as well
6269198 we need consistent predictable and sustainable revenue streams to fully fund education instead of accepting business as usual
6269199 im an example of that of a poor kid being afforded the opportunity to go to college the value of education is that important and im up to the challenge
6269200 we cant arrest the problem away we need to hold the police accountable for policing our community their job is to serve and protect not to rule and govern
6269201 we cant have kids not having things to do i had options
6269202 unfortunately the philanthropic community in the late 70s and early 80s decided recreation and development are no longer important
6269203 change minds and allow youth to see themselves outside of their circumstances
6269204 we need to re energize and re value our community jewels and the community should make the case to government and the philanthropic community
6269205 thats different from outsiders telling us whats wrong we can do a better job of marketing our own assets that way well continue to get partners to see the value in our district because were promoting it
6269206 small businesses are the backbone of the economy in order for businesses to grow they need contracts and opportunities its important to diversify funding streams to provide livable wages or else people are threatened to become the working poor
6269207 you have to chart out your desired outcome then move backward
6269208 you have to find those places and spaces where the people are
6269209 there are critical issues not being responded to or articulated and there have to be more aggressive strategies in place a laid back style wont work in our community it requires real time action dont wait for them to call you
6269210 we have to work together to have kids excel in school
6269211 i believe that light rail should be going through north minneapolis
6269212 folks are building all around us and the business will go there too
6269213 but we need to work on visibility of what we have done
6269214 i ran because district 58b was lacking opportunity for children adults and seniors i saw that were not getting to where we wanted to be
6269215 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
6269216 all we have to do is ask and we shall receive
6269217 these gas prices were really killing a lot of them
6269218 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6269219 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6269220 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6269221 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6269222 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6269223 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6269224 some of them may have said you know what i dont need to be a part of the army any more because they dont want me or they dont know how to treat me
6269225 well weve learned a lot and i think weve improved a lot and this is a way to reconnect with them
6269226 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise
6269227 please be candid in your conversations with our staff as your comments and concerns are important to us
6269228 is americas sweetheart and an internationally known entertainer who takes care of herself you can see it in her smile her skin her confidence and her obvious physical fitness
6269229 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6269230 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6269231 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship
6269232 i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6269233 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6269234 victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story it is now with her lawyers
6269235 i have been a dolly fan all of my life
6269236 mr robinson really appreciates and takes seriously the opportunity which has been given to him by the court and the prosecution to have all of the charges against him dismissed upon successful completion of a counseling program
6269237 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6269238 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
6269239 she had brains a body and the ability to make men love her
6269240 i never met britney spears i cant have animosity with someone i dont know
6269241 you have way bigger fish to fry little mama than me about a couple songs
6269242 they didnt want to return a phone call so i said all right well i guess i will take these songs that were written for britney and give them to other people time is money
6269243 someday therell be an n sync reunion but i dont think the time is right now
6269244 maybe a few years down the road when we have gotten a chance to realize who we are as individuals well get back together as a group and put more music out
6269245 may help strengthen your bodys natural immune system and promote overall wellness
6269246 these are meaningless claims designed to move product they know this claim is something were going to be attracted to even if theres no evidence that the stuff really helps
6269247 i would personally not buy anything certified as organic from china
6269248 china has a very very small almost non existent food testing program
6269249 id be concerned that despite the organic label the food might be adulterated
6269250 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6269251 steven is one of the best players in the nfl and wed like to have him back
6269252 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6269253 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6269254 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6269255 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6269256 its kind of our standard thing we have to talk im on track with him seeing how hes doing we probably talk more about life than football every time he does something right i let him know and every time he does something wrong i let him know
6269257 this is personal for me my pay is by them letting me come through those big gates for 14 years
6269258 velik del svoje kariere sem pre ivel v dresu manchester uniteda in teh asov se bom zmeraj spominjal zdaj sem pripravljen na nove izzive arsenal je znan po tehni ni igri igralski kader pa je mlad in zelo izku en
6269259 public behaviour im gonna force everyone else to pretend they approve of
6269260 i have no problem with chris my blog reader a guy and his friends dressing up like big stuffed animals and doing god knows what to each other i do have a problem if he insists its okay to wear his furry costume at work and pretending to be very surprised if people dont just take it in stride like its perfectly normal
6269261 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6269262 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6269263 15 of the population being constipated at any given moment
6269264 if we have to fight them now is the time from now on we will get weaker and they stronger
6269265 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6269266 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6269267 no one will ever again tell poland what to do and what not to do
6269268 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats a hundred percent sure
6269269 its georgia today ukraine tomorrow and poland may be next
6269270 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6269271 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6269272 first was nato membership then joining the european union and now a tangible tightening of our alliance with the u s
6269273 russia wants to regain influence over poland similar to influence russia enjoyed during the time of the warsaw pact
6269274 any increase in polish defense and security goes against those plans
6269275 when russia performs military operations that are perceived as aggressive and brutal even relatively far from our borders people in poland fear
6269276 the war in georgia very quickly and suddenly changed the mood of poles
6269277 in a week a strong majority emerged supporting the american missile shield in poland
6269278 the americans were unwilling to give poland any anti missile and air defense system optimized to defend polish airspace and territory they did not want to give poland patriot missiles
6269279 people in poland do remember history and they understand what it means to have such a neighbor returning to his old ways
6269280 people see the war in georgia so of course it creates an impact on peoples thinking
6269281 to tell you the truth i just want to chill out right now
6269282 i want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now

6269293 right now in jamaica the rum is flowing and the reggae is playing

6269297 this is a fast track i told myself that if im going to get that world record im going to get it here
6269298 i knew i would go that fast ive been running fast times and shutting down at the end
6269299 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6269300 by becoming the first ever software as a service company to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of one billion dollars our second quarter performance is a milestone for salesforce
6269301 said chairman and chief executive marc benioff in a prepared statement
6269302 our largest customers are increasingly becoming the best examples of what is possible using the power of our growing portfolio of software as a service applications and our emerging platform as a service

6269305 assemble a kitchen chemistry set and toast to covalent bonding no longer restricted to high school science classes and elitist research centers industrial design marvels like beakers and flasks are an economical and durable alternative to the martha stewart effect
6269306 there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to overeducate ourselves in the wild struggle for existence we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place the thoroughly well informed man that is the modern ideal and the mind of the thoroughly informed man is a dreadful thing
6269307 aunt wendy your life was a blessing to many and you will not be forgotten
6269308 who benefits more from this me or the idol franchise

6269311 my friend and i were walking over there like this lock arm in arm
6269312 i would be talking with some of my friends and he would come up from behind me stick his arm around me like this put arm on girls shoulder and pull her in give her a little shake showing exactly what he did to me

6269325 america owes the men and women of the vfw a debt that could really never be repaid
6269326 you fought for our freedoms and then when you came home you volunteered to continue to serve this nation
6269327 i want to thank the members of the armed forces that are here today
6269328 there is no greater honor than being the commander in chief of the united states and im proud to be in your presence
6269329 who served in distant lands should have to live without shelter in the land they fought to defend
6269330 to help our wounded warriors build lives of hope and promise and dignity

6269337 we dont know why theyre on the list they dont know why theyre on the list the government wont tell us why theyre on the list
6269338 gostei muito deste bocadinho garanto que gostei tive mesmo momentos de entusiasmo daqueles em que o mundo contra todas as chances bateu certo mas outro momento chegou o da partida
6269339 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6269340 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6269341 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things

6269343 el plan general de ordenaci n urbana se empez a tramitar en el a o 2000 con la particularidad de que hemos planteado el mismo suelo urbano que el solicitado en su momento por el psoe pero con la diferencia de que en este caso la comisi n de ordenaci n del territorio y medio ambiente de canarias cotmac lo ha recortado
6269344 hemos solicitado que las inmediaciones de la plaza del cristo sea zona urbana pero se da la circunstancia de que entre esas parcelas urbanas hay un enemigo al parecer del psoe no obstante la mayor parte de las parcelas existentes en ese lugar pertenecen a un t o del concejal del pnc pero he de aclarar que nosotros no tenemos en cuenta a qui nes pertenecen esos terrenos s lo miramos el crecimiento que quede claro que no pretendemos beneficiar a nadie lo nico que estamos modificando con respecto al planeamiento anterior es volver a adscribir al suelo r stico como zona para facilitar la agricultura y la dotaci n de equipamientos agropecuarios

6269348 ante las alegaciones presentadas por los vecinos del municipio apenas unas pocas han salido adelante s lo han sido estimadas aquellas de vecinos afines y a ex concejales de su partido
6269349 el gobierno del municipio tanquero ha estimado unas alegaciones pertenecientes a un ex concejal de su partido con el rechazo de la cotmac por considerar inviable esta bolsa de suelo como urbano consolidado de edificaci n abierta tras varias preguntas del edil socialista pablo est vez acerca de esta cuesti n la sorpresa fue may scula cuando el equipo de gobierno insiste en seguir adelante con estas actuaciones desautorizando al rgano responsable del ordenamiento urban stico

6269492 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6269493 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6269494 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6269495 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time

6269706 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6269707 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6269708 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6269709 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6269710 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

6269908 when people sense the sickness of american politics and government what they sense is something missing for forty years from our national dialog sincere and patriotic partisan debate there should be two political parties both committed to the american dream both in love with their nation both proud to defend her instead one party has accepted the lies told about america on the streets of chicago in 1968 too rich too powerful too confident too comfortable this is what the rioters in chicago thought of america then this is what the heart of the democratic party thinks now forty years after their political party died

6269922 i was looking at myself saying that guy is fast
6269923 then i went to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6269924 for every one of his strides i have to go two and a half times faster
6269925 hes 6 5 and he runs like hes 5 9
6269926 how fast can one man go until you cant go any faster
6269927 thats what we call a phenomenon something you cant explain
6269928 he should not be allowed to open his mouth about anything
6269929 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6269930 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6269931 i blew my mind and then i blew the worlds mind
6269932 i knew i could go that fast i have shown potential all season i have been running fast times
6269933 i told myself that if i was going to get the world record it was going to be here because this track is real fast i was going to invest everything i had on it
6269934 i have been dreaming of this ever since i was yay high the 200 has been my life since i was 15 and was the youngest to ever win the world juniors
6269935 it means a lot to me and it means a lot to my country also
6269936 i talked to my prime minister and he said everything was blocked off in jamaica everybody is in the street i have written history i am real proud
6269937 bolt has made history he has broken a 12 year old record that was held by michael johnson and at the same time he crushed the 100 meter record

6269945 the important point is that the intent of network management has and continues to be to provide a great experience for our customers

6269949 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
6269950 obamas success online is as much about how our society has changed how our media ecology has changed just in the past four years
6269951 in one afternoon my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with thats not necessarily obama thats the internet
6269952 but you have to give credit where credit is due obamas internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes theyve basically leapfrogged not just the clinton and mccain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters
6269953 i like to say that we at the dean campaign were the wright brothers we put this rickety thing together and got it off the ground but the folks in obamas online team are the apollo project the question is are they apollo 8 or apollo 11 if theyre apollo 11 theyre going to launch a guy and land him in the white house

6269957 more than 4000 people were recognized as victims in the case
6269958 more than 950 expert examinations were carried out we examined 600 crime scenes in tskhinvali and ten other settlements more than 5000 objects and documents were taken into evidence and are already part of the criminal case
6269959 the georgian side opened fire directly on a russian peacekeeping battalion
6269960 ambulances were destroyed in the first minutes of the attack the russian soldiers held their positions for a day and a half and then retreated under grenade fire more than 40 people were wounded
6269961 among the documents we took into evidence is a map with military goals by the hour and minute
6269962 there have been numbers mentioned up to 2000 the difference is clearly in that we are talking about those we can list by name we cannot count the numerous burials on the territory of south ossetia we cannot perform autopsies on them first we have to question the local residents who buried the dead their neighbors soldiers chance people
6269963 people were forced to bury bodies in gardens and courtyards there are masses of those unidentified hillocks only in some cases have we been able to determine who is buried there
6269964 it was great to be back though not so nice to start out down 2 0
6269965 im happy with this result because we created many chances and my players looked for the win up to the final whistle
6269966 we know we can play better and be more of a unit so we will start that hopefully against andorra and then croatia
6269967 we started slowly you need to be consistent in the first half we could have been trailing
6269968 im very happy and especially excited by the portuguese display
6269969 we moved the ball around well and we managed to create a lot of chances were ready for the next phase of work

6269974 the fabric of those companies was so intertwined with its political patrimony that ordinary considerations were put aside for what was or wasnt politically acceptable
6269975 as a result of that the way one would operate a business according to business standards gave way to operating a business in a way that was palatable to a political system
6269976 it would be a mistake for the government to try and operate the whole mortgage finance business in the long run
6269977 fannie and freddie have stood up better and functioned better than a lot of private institutions
6269978 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
6269979 the opening date of the film was shifted around like the planchette on a ouija board a sure sign that the studio knew it had one of those hollywood we have a problem movies that needed to arrive in theaters in a relatively quiet part of the summer season
6269980 rainn wilson is off his rocker to take this role
