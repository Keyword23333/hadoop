8940001 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk said rungi a priest of the passionists religious order speaking from his convent in the town of mondragone
8940002 rungis idea appeared in newspapers around the world after he wrote of a contest for nuns on his blog called by some
8940003 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete he said
8940004 he said his concept for the contest in which nuns would vote for themselves on his blog would include attributes such as their spirituality social awareness charity and other qualities
8940005 rungi wrote in his blog that his intention was to show
8940006 making coffee this way is simple first fill the bottom reservoir with water there should be just enough to touch the little valve on the side next put the basket in and fill it with ground coffee add just enough to reach the top rim there s no need to tamp it down as you would in an espresso machine screw on the top and put it over a burner on medium heat a few moments later you ll hear the bubbling and gurgling that means your pot is ready take it off the heat and serve

8940011 you need perspective and distance everyone wants to go to the olympics and if you could do 10 more you would because its so special just to be there
8940012 but for what it would take for 2012 its about what i would feel like on a wet wintry morning in december
8940013 if the passion and desire is still there then of course its possible but a rather large and enjoyable holiday must come first
8940014 you need the physical break but you need the mental and emotional break more than anything else and then you can see more clearly which way to go

8940033 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8940034 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree

8940106 racism didnt end when richard parsons got his job as the head of time warner or when kenneth chenault became the head of american express
8940107 harold washington being elected mayor of chicago didnt end racism in that city
8940108 so how do we expect one man to get in there and fix an entire nation
8940109 throughout the black community weve got double digit unemployment health and health care disparities education disparities if we elected a messiah he couldnt close some of those gaps
8940110 we have a cradle to prison pipeline that threatens the last 45 years of civil rights progress
8940111 i think about the election and im so proud of america right now but we have to continue to ensure that everybody partakes in the american dream
8940112 but i think its impossible to make the argument that black americans need to be treated differently because black people cant get a fair shake in america
8940113 you need special public policies to level the playing field how do you look at sen obama and make that argument
8940114 we have stripped away the argument that you have to have one group of policies for one group of people over the other

8940131 its not that other developments dont have a sense of community
8940132 its more about the ability to foster that sense of community
8940133 instead of having small private yards youre grouping that area into a community space which is a lot larger than you would otherwise get
8940134 clearly theres still a niche and there are people who like these buildings

8940156 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
8940157 we find distinct partisan patterns in the u s and british stock markets in that dividend yields and personal income from stock returns increases decreases in election years when the market expects the right wing left wing party to win elections and under right wing left wing administrations this intriguing finding suggests that right wing parties arguably have a greater ability and willingness for priming the economy in ways that has a positive impact on stock returns and income growth conversely our findings suggest that agents in the u s and british stock markets are genuinely concerned that the democratic and labor parties will remain committed to maximizing redistribution and welfare programs after elections by adopting policies that may lower stock prices more generally the presence of partisan patterns in the stock market indirectly support extant claims that partisanship has distinct effects on real economic outcomes since price movements in stock markets often reflect changes in macroeconomic outcomes such as personal income growth
8940158 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
8940159 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
8940160 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
8940161 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
8940162 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
8940163 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
8940164 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
8940165 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
8940166 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
8940167 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
8940168 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
8940169 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
8940170 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
8940171 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
8940172 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
8940173 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
8940174 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
8940175 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
8940176 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
8940177 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
8940178 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
8940179 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
8940180 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
8940181 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
8940182 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
8940183 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
8940184 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
8940185 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8940186 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
8940187 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
8940188 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

8940195 will the council help me out if i fall behind on payments for my new plasma tv and lexus no why should housing be any different lets also factor in the fact that half of them cant even afford weekly bin collections now theyre selling mortgages sometime i wonder why i work and save
8940196 why should the taxpayer be asked to bolster a grossly over inflated property market local authorities will be taken for a ride when buying unsold property from developers at inflated prices

8940219 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8940220 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8940221 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8940222 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8940223 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8940224 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8940225 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8940226 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

8940228 we are seeing a growing trend within our broadcast customer community to use more and more open standards based it infrastructure where possible this provides economies to them not just in infrastructure costs but more so on the training and ongoing maintenance as well as enabling multipurposing of infrastructure
8940229 quantum stornext is not just open but also best of breed when we combine it with an innovative tool like david systems hac it enables a broadcaster to retain their specialised media workflow requirements whilst at the same time take advantage of standardised infrastructure and the benefits this brings
8940230 the hac from david systems allows stornext to recognise the time code requests from broadcast specific software and provides partial file restore from the archive
8940231 on a larger scale across the whole organisation this will certainly help alleviate unnecessary loads being placed upon both network and storage infrastructures
8940232 i purchased this camera a month ago and so far its been a great purchase the camera has great focus and the pictures never come out blurry battery life is quite good and the big lcd is nice for displaying the pictures
8940233 heres a big one device does not power through usb all other devices i have run on usb power when you plug them in not sony and guess what they have a solution you can buy a power adapter for 39 99
8940234 the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not as user friendly as the other sony t models everything is through the touch screen and not on knobs on the outside of the camera but i assume thats because there are so many features they had to do it that way
8940235 the t300 camera shows goes beyond face detection to other functions that help customers capture their best photos automatically

8940241 the study shows that the mere assignment causes people to view the case to be consistent with their roles
8940242 in the study we used a subtle manipulation and it seemed to push people quite far

8940244 ich kann in diesem fr hen stadium das verhalten der bundeswehr soldaten zwar nicht bewerten aber f r das verh ltnis zwischen deutschen streitkr ften und afghanischer bev lkerung ist entscheidend wie das deutsche regionalkommando nun auf die hinterbliebenen und die rtliche bev lkerung zugeht
8940245 sie waren sich der folgen ihres handelns sehr wohl bewusst
8940246 der j ngste zwischenfall in afghanistan zeigt einmal mehr dass die bundeswehr mehr und mehr zur kriegspartei wird
8940247 das ist anlass f r eine grundlegende revision der afghanistan politik

8940277 much of legal history in the united states is a history of injustices long tolerated by law and people of different views see that in our current legal landscape accept the fact that our law and our constitutional democracy are imperfect keep a critical distance from that which you study and seek ever to do better
8940278 the first thing i want you all to remember today is that yes you do all belong here
8940279 to understand some of the tradition of success and leadership
8940280 our alumni provide financial contributions to help run the law school
8940281 were here to launch and celebrate with you the dawn of a new chapter in your lives
8940282 my job is to create a mosaic of a class with lots of different shapes hues and colors sizes and intensity
8940283 they help students get to know each other as well as get to know their new community
8940284 participating in the orientation service project with saje not only taught me more about the neighborhood around usc but also the ways i can be a contributing member of the greater community during my time at law school
8940285 saje is such a positive force in the area and it was exciting to think about the ways i could use the skills ill be learning at usc law to contribute to the organizations work i met great people both my new classmates and community members and im looking forward to stay connected with them in the years ahead
8940286 everyone had an amazing time at a place called home as we were leaving the recreations director jeremiah told us that we were the best volunteers they had ever had it was extremely flattering
8940287 oh thats a 11100010 instruction that means you need to add subtract two registers
8940288 much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8940289 at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used
8940290 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8940291 fails to address in any manner the statutory criteria for a grant of forbearance
8940292 rather than expend the commissions limited resources on such a thinly supported petition
8940293 perhaps the commission should have dismissed the petition as deficient when it was first filed
8940294 although orbitcom does not provide any information about any of its rates we assume that it is requesting forbearance from these rules because its intrastate rates are higher than its interstate rates
8940295 the commission is now in the unfortunate position of having to either grant or deny the forbearance petition despite the lack of information to take no action would result in the petition being deemed granted
8940296 unlicensed spectrum is great for short range coverage like wifi in a house but if you want to cover all of washington you need licensed spectrum in order to make sure a transmitter is protected from interference
8940297 its certainly something worth exploring rather than introducing potentially millions of tv viewers to unlicensed interference
8940298 the pro of licensing is that it would bring money to the treasury
8940299 the con is that it potentially stifles the creativity that may occur more freely in an unlicensed environment
8940300 our engineers may decide we might not be able to fit another license between those stations
8940301 if you take into consideration that there may not be anybody willing to bid on a nationwide d block license then it is reasonable to look at regional licensing

8940309 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8940310 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8940311 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8940312 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8940313 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8940314 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8940315 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8940316 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8940317 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8940318 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8940319 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8940320 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8940321 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8940322 seg n los datos preliminares de que disponemos creemos que este a o el agujero en la capa de ozono estar en los niveles medios
8940323 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8940324 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8940325 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8940326 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8940327 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8940328 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8940329 she is doing everything she can to move away from how she is perceived in london
8940330 the truth is that max offered her a way out of it all she was offered stability and a move away from the negative press she was receiving in the uk
8940331 now peaches is planning a move to new york and is starting over with a place at nyu and a new job at nylon magazine
8940332 she wasnt too sure about new york at first but her father persuaded her and so she signed up at the university and was offered a job
8940333 she now has her fathers blessing with max which is a weight off her mind bob wants her to have structure and a routine
8940334 were going to participate in some testing with t mobile in seattle to determine to what level there maybe interference before we proceed
8940335 the chairman felt that it was worth taking the time to address this issue of interference and thats why we set up this testing for next week
8940336 because i had a very loving mother who taught me to be fair and to care enough to want the best for all people
8940337 hulu is committed to making its content available worldwide to do so we must work through a number of legal and business issues including obtaining international streaming rights know that we are working to make this happen and will continue to do so given the international background of the hulu team we have both a professional and personal interest in bringing hulu to a global audience
8940338 whilst we remain alert to the impact of difficult economic conditions our outlook for the remainder of 2008 remains unchanged

8940343 i saw a rally of vintage bikes and fell in love and so decided to restore one now this bike means a lot to me i can give my life for the bike
8940344 it takes time to get the bikes and find the spare parts but then being a mechanic means to be able to get these bikes in perfect running conditions
8940345 the love for these bikes comes from the fact that we can nurture them back to their old self and then get the wind on the face it is about freedom it is about being attached to the history anyone who says they dont like them or want them they are lying

8940355 gale denley was the most influential mississippi journalism educator of his generation and a truly beloved newspaper man of the old school
8940356 he was a gentle man who faced a lot of adversity in his life with courage and hope our friendship has been one of the great joys of my life
8940357 gale demonstrated an ability throughout his adult life to both practice and teach good journalism
8940358 moreover he thoroughly understood and appreciated mississippi politics history and the varied cultures that make up our rather complex society
8940359 in the classroom and as a journalist gale denley by talent and temperament influenced generations of journalists not to be afraid of anyone or anything but above all else to be fair
8940360 gale was one of the very special people in my life when i ended my journalism career and moved to washington almost 19 years ago my political column was in 43 newspapers gale was the reason for that he meant so much to his journalism students at ole miss but he meant just as much to our entire state
8940361 il nuovo palazzo del cinema potr essere il simbolo di un paese che in tutte le sue componenti politiche sociali e economiche cerca la via dello sviluppo del superamento delle difficolt della rinascita quando si lavora insieme per un grande obiettivo si ottengono sempre grandi risultati
8940362 sono molto soddisfatto per levento ma allarmato per i tagli del governo alla cultura e allistruzione il festival del cinema di venezia la pi importante anzi lunica mostra di questo paese la posa della prima pietra un inizio ma anche un punto dapprodo dopo aver domato un mare di burocrazia
8940363 oggi un giorno importante perch si d inizio ad unopera importantissima per lisola per qualificare tutta leconomia turistica veneziana e per la biennale questopera sarebbe stata impossibile senza la leale collaborazione tra stato regione e enti locali resto preoccupato per le difficolt che riguardano i fondi che dovevano essere raccolti dalla vendita dellarea dellex ospedale al mare ceduta dallasl 12 al comune di venezia a breve larea sar posta in vendita e il ricavato servir a finanziare questo progetto
8940364 ci sono tante regole che devono essere osservate ma io penso che la prima sia quella del buon senso il buon senso e la ragionevolezza ci salvano nel momento in cui dobbiamo prendere delle decisioni cos si evitano gli errori
8940365 bene ha fatto quel guardia sala quando ha deciso di chiedere informazioni sul da farsi di fronte ad una donna invisibile esistono leggi e circolari ministeriali che tra il 1975 e il 2000 hanno normato con spirito di tolleranza una questione assai delicata accettando qualsiasi tipo di indumento purch lasciasse il volto scoperto noi dobbiamo rispettare gli usi e i costumi degli altri in cambio per gli altri rispettino le nostre leggi
8940366 non licenziamo nessuno come potremmo licenziare una persona semplicemente perch stato un po stupidino e non ha lasciato entrare una con il velo non c altro di cui interessarsi nei musei civici veneziani tutti possono venire vestiti come vogliono lunico suggerimento che mi sento di dare ai turisti di non visitare le sale espositive con una benda davanti agli occhi
8940367 so che mi state ascoltando avverto la vostra presenza so che avete paura di noi paura di cambiare io non conosco il futuro non sono venuto qui a dirvi come andr a finire ma sono venuto a dirvi come comincer adesso appender il telefono e far vedere a tutta questa gente quello che non volete che vedano mostrer loro un mondo senza di voi un mondo senza regole e controlli senza frontiere e confini un mondo in cui tutto possibile quello che accadr dopo dipender da voi e da loro

8940370 the code i used was given to me by cindy http www skem9 com 80870 so please do not use it without her permission
8940371 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8940372 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8940373 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8940374 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8940375 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8940376 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8940377 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8940378 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8940379 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8940380 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8940381 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8940382 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8940383 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8940384 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8940385 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8940386 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8940387 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8940388 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8940389 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8940390 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8940391 full of romance humor rivalry and betrayal a passion most pure will captivate readers from the first page
8940392 i loved julie lessmans a passion most pure from the second i picked it up until the very last moment i stopped reading
8940393 i devoured this book and loved every single page this is a thick juicy read and one i would pick up again in a heartbeat
8940394 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8940395 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8940396 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8940397 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8940398 every young athlete aspires to one day see their face on the cover of the wheaties box
8940399 its been a huge inspiration to see great gymnastics champions on the box like mary lou and carly plus the magnificent seven from 1996 its a privilege and an honor for me to be on the box and im very excited to be part of the wheaties tradition
8940400 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8940401 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8940402 look well let aaron in after all he had his life threatened with that whole chasing the babe thing but you youve got the 500 home runs thats good enough we dont want too many of you guys on these lists
8940403 we have made it quite clear that we are interested in clean waiver from the nsg
8940404 we have presented our case we have made our position clear to interlocutors
8940405 im more into winning games id like to set the record for winning games
8940406 we had just beat one of the top teams in the country texas i thought this was going to be the up and coming team on the west coast coming in i thought wed compete for the pac 10 championship
8940407 unfortunately it didnt work out but i still have confidence in our team
8940408 whether im the decoy or the main option im just going to have to produce im into winning football games i dont try to focus on stats
8940409 i plan on getting double teamed but i still have to produce
8940410 for the most part i didnt feel i was ready to compete at that level
8940411 not only is he a great player on the field but hes a good guy off the field
8940412 dont pee on my leg and tell me its raining
8940413 the dnc just lot a lot of its former loyalists
8940414 another morning after a crazy night before im searchin for my blue jeans on a strangers bedroom floor well shouldnt i feel guilty well i dont feel a thing id wake her up and say goodbye but i cant recall her name
8940415 everyone has had a positive response and watched it progress every day
8940416 when you run a quality program youre always trying to improve
8940417 we will have the football soccer field hockey and in the spring the lacrosse teams playing on the new turf field
8940418 it will also benefit the physical education department the schools ive talked with have said switching to turf has had a positive impact on athletics but more importantly physical education
8940419 we wanted to make that field a place where kids could learn in physical education and play on from our athletic and community teams from three in the afternoon right through to the weekend
8940420 we wanted to do it in a way that was safe and cost effective we also felt doing the turf was the way to maximize safety
8940421 when weather gets bad on the field when it was grass it gets really sloppy
8940422 in the old days we played in mud and slop but not anymore the kids too are really enthused about this whole situation
8940423 in addition to the field we have worked to improve the drainage of the entire facility
8940424 every field will benefit because of the control of the water
8940425 weve had significant support from the community its been a great thing
8940426 we never get a chance until sectionals everyone plays on carpet at the end of the year in a stadium with announcers and now we can experience that all year
8940427 its been nice because it really hasnt been an inconvenience to us

8940433 i need to pick that up dust that vacuum here
8940434 i have a question thats been nagging me for some time
8940435 i am ready for another chapter now whether or not this chapter is one quick page or it is a couple of paragraphs long will depend on how well the move does and how well i can grasp acting
8940436 i like to think of myself as being more well rounded than just a host
8940437 ive never been to an acting class but ive been through enough in my life that there are enough emotions and feelings and situations to pull from and i have the ability to do that and thats all acting is being a really good liar

8940439 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8940440 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8940441 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8940442 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8940443 gas prices are too high as you know i do own my own jet and i have been having flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career
8940444 now if im flying back and forth like twice in a month thats like 200 000 or 250 000 round trip that im back on american airlines right now ok

8940446 i want to give a shout out to all my saudi arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers and sisters from all the countries that have oil if you could all please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
8940447 but right now can you believe it i am actually flying commercial thats how high gas prices are ok so i feel you look im at the gate right now
8940448 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8940449 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
8940450 this is just a first step we have a long list of things we want to add

8940457 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe
8940458 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8940459 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
8940460 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8940461 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8940462 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8940463 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8940464 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it

8940594 es un viaje al momento en que arranca la historia de muchos municipios madrile os
8940595 somos pueblos peque os los vecinos contemplan diariamente las edificaciones pero muchos de ellos se sienten ajenos a las construcciones y no tienen una relaci n cotidiana con ellas creo que es importante tambi n integrarlos como parte de la vida tur stica

8940597 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8940598 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8940599 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8940600 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8940601 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8940602 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8940603 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8940604 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8940605 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimize human to human infection

8940612 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come i dont know anything because i have not spoken to peter for the last two days
8940613 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too
8940614 but at the moment what is happening on the pitch is the only important thing for me for my players to play well against tottenham is what matters
8940615 it is the policy of the wayne county prosecutors office not to comment on matters related to negotiations in the kilpatrick case or any other case
8940616 reports regarding negotiations in print and broadcast media are not coming from my office there are other sources who for some unknown reason wish to give erroneous information to the press we caution the public to remember this

8940634 il disegno vivido e inquieto il movimento del viaggio aereo nella memoria e nel sogno trascinato e tenuto sospeso dalla musica e dai silenzi la tenerezza dellanimale e soprattutto lo sguardo doloroso e offeso del ragazzo gli spazi aperti e quelli chiusi gli occhi che guardano ciguardano rendono questo racconto psicologico e affettivo ancora una volta radicato nella propria terra tra la propria gente vibrante e pieno di implicazioni cine poetiche

8940678 well thats a big question but ill boil it down in simple terms because of the hotter temperatures paso wines tend to be more deeply extracted and big the higher temps lead to higher sugars which in turn lead to higher alcohol when making my wines i strive to deliver big and bold flavors but also wines that hold up when paired with food some of my wines are meant to solo imbibing to be sure but the lexicon that you are enjoying is a great food wine bright acidity and deep fruit dont overpower and are perfect with lighter foods or even hearty entrees

8940685 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

8940838 the city eventually decommissioned the wall in april 2007 quietly dispatching workers to paint it a solid off white one afternoon

8940849 last time we played the cats it was disappointing it was very ordinary so hopefully tomorrow the boys will put a good foot forward
8940850 games are forgotten pretty quickly in this caper because you have to and like i said geelong can say what they want its their time in the sun at the moment and nobody can question that
8940851 but the world turns and you wouldnt want to be saying too much about other sides and how theyre going
8940852 this is the first time in seven years since ive been at the club as a coach that ive been in this position and probably even as a player me and john
8940853 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940854 its just a number on the back really i played more of a ball playing role this year anyway
8940855 theres no doubt this is going to be a tough game but we will go into it some confidence and hopefully get a good win
8940856 we need to keep winning to shore up a final spot so we will be focussed on the cowboys on saturday night
8940857 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940858 to be honest i think today was probably the hardest match ive played
8940859 its tough to back it up i was pretty happy when i won my first round but i couldnt be too excited because of having to focus on this my opponent today played really well i thought
8940860 i was constantly under pressure today which is why she has been 14 in the world
8940861 she has got a very aggressive game and a very aggressive serve
8940862 i thought i did the best i could on the day but im going to work towards handling it a bit better
8940863 being able to absorb the opponents power is something that im working on at the moment and that is something that came up a few times today
8940864 its about being able to realise just how much faster the ball is coming to you and being able to react well enough
8940865 there were probably a lot of cheap errors on my behalf today which is probably the big difference in the transition between juniors and seniors
8940866 thats definitely something im going to be working on and looking to improve on
8940867 going from the juniors to the seniors is a big learning curve
8940868 ive learned so much in the last few months of playing challengers rather than juniors
8940869 you get a real feel for it when you are amongst it all the time
8940870 it is a big difference i must admit but its good because you are always being challenged and thats why we play the game
8940871 im very happy with the way that my game is going im improving a lot and obviously my ranking is rising pretty well but ive obviously got a lot to work on which is also exciting
8940872 ive been away for about four months and im looking forward to seeing my family and friends
8940873 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940874 i became aware of a chap beaming and pointing at his midriff
8940875 then another chap was pointing at me jabbing his finger in the direction of my stomach
8940876 i reached instinctively for my middle button and then thought sod it
8940877 i am sad to see that some chinese bloggers are now attacking me for my lack of respect since there was no disrespect intended
8940878 its just that there are times when you have to take a stand
8940879 a vast and withering rebuke to those who thought that the triumph of capitalism must be accompanied by democratic pluralism
8940880 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing

8940884 its very good obviously for our team but i also think for the game
8940885 just looking at the incident it would have been pretty harsh to get a week for that
8940886 maybe im talking a bit out of school here but thats how i saw it and obviously the judiciary saw that again today so its good for us and its good for the game
8940887 i always thought i had a reasonably strong case but that in itself is never enough in these sort of things
8940888 our position was we agreed with the referee lyndon brays call in the game and he got the call from the assistant bryce lawrence so we agreed with that
8940889 i think that what they were looking at was if it was unusually dangerous i think it was just the interpretation of dangerous
8940890 theres just no point in worrying about those things just get on and do your best and dont let it distract you essentially
8940891 we get enough injuries let alone other sources of absence and those challenges players dont enjoy and rightly so
8940892 were conscious of the fact theres the prospect he may not be there but were conscious of the fact of the prospect he may be there and he does have a good background of preparation anyway
8940893 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940894 were very conscious of the history weve read a lot of messages and so forth from supporters
8940895 but our guys are pretty connected to that anyway and mainly because its now their turn
8940896 they do have an awareness but theyre not hung up on whats been before and they recognise to that end theyve got a great opportunity to do something that has meaning and thats important to them
8940897 obviously it was a big step for the group on saturday afternoon when we won here for the first time in eight years
8940898 most of the guys are pretty aware of the history behind ellis park so its another milestone and hoodoo to break if we perform well on saturday afternoon
8940899 its obviously there the history and the way that south africa play at ellis park is very good but i dont think that its something that the guys are too intimidated by its just a matter of embracing it and performing well
8940900 it took a lot of time but i think that i was pretty keen on winning so i was reasonably focused on that
8940901 we realise that what we were last week wont be good enough and we think that that injection of enthusiasm will serve us well
8940902 the good thing for tahu is hes had a good background of preparation now so its not nearly so daunting for him as it may have been if hed gone in in week one
8940903 you look at the context they are going to bring everything that theyve got plus a bit more because they wont be enjoying their current circumstance
8940904 last week we were able to deny early some of that pressure and that will be important again
8940905 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940906 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8940907 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8940908 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8940909 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940910 i know they got beaten 4 2 on the weekend against melbourne but they are a very fine side theyve got fullbacks who want to get forward and theyve got players in the midfield who want to try to play out all the time
8940911 daniels extremely dangerous shane smeltz is probably one of the best strikers in the a league so certainly theyre very dangerous
8940912 smeltz certainly is a big factor in their team winning or not and certainly daniel is those two drive a lot of it and especially going forward
8940913 we didnt get enough numbers going forward against queensland so to play with two up front agos going to have to be fit
8940914 that was a tough ask for robbie younis last week his debut away to queensland under that sort of pressure so we didnt expect too much from him and he was disappointed with his performance but its nothing you can hang him out to dry with it was always going to be a tough ask no matter who played in that role
8940915 dodd is a very good option we used him in the asian champions league and he was very effective for us
8940916 i know a few people have been critical of alemao personally as a footballer hes an exceptional footballer he needs time to adapt and its a different country
8940917 hes playing a different type of football than hes used to in brazil where he played a little further up and showed all his attacking flair were using him more as a fullback knowing he can get forward
8940918 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940919 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8940920 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8940921 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8940922 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8940923 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8940924 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8940925 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8940926 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940927 im humbling anticipating a game this week and thats it
8940928 im very much looking forward to the game im ready its a big game for us we need a win and im confident we can get one
8940929 craig moore and danny were two exceptional players and they still are
8940930 theyre both very experienced internationals and did the business over in the toughest leagues in the world
8940931 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940932 weve got a really great record at ellis park 29 wins in 41 tests and it always feels great to play a test at this venue
8940933 no test match is a dead rubber even though there will be no trophies to be won on saturday we have to show we are on the right track
8940934 theres still the end of year tour to come and we dont want to go on that trip thinking about whether we should change things or worry if things are working or not
8940935 we want to get some confidence out of this game
8940936 it was a temptation to make changes but i studied the game and i felt we werent too bad
8940937 if we lose three in a row how can you change that winning and losing are the same thing to me its just that winning is much nicer
8940938 maybe our fire wasnt hot enough last week maybe we didnt have the right pots and pans hopefully we can eat the food this weekend
8940939 the meeting was held in a good spirit and we spoke openly about the issues
8940940 it was good to meet and discuss areas of concern and going forward we are now much clearer from both sides
8940941 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8940942 so we need to keep pressing for absolute superiority in speed agility and access to information

8940944 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8940945 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong
8940946 there were a lot of side discussions going on about the disposition of passengers and the crew and the whole thing i think now that while those situations are beginning to straighten themselves out this will bring a little more clarity to those discussions which i presume will go on for the next little while

8940951 christian militants have killed swamiji not maoists police as well gt as the orissa government trying to cover up the matter and sheltering gt the church sponsored militants
8940952 we have also demanded to set up a commission to look into the gt activities of churches missionaries church sponsored ngos foreign gt funding to ngos working for conversion and strict implementation of gt anti conversion laws
8940953 it seems orissa government is patronizing conversion activities and gt it is also under pressure from the churches

8940956 the killing of swamiji was most unfortunate incident and unwarranted gt he was a true social reformer we all missed guruji of chakapa for a gt longtime his security concerns downplayed
8940957 christians have killed swamiji we would give a befitting reply to it gt very soon
8940958 we would forced to opt violent protest if action not taken against gt the killers
8940959 we have called a 12 hour shut down on gt monday protesting against the killing

8940978 the first 30 minutes we did everything wrong we could do wrong but we hung in
8940979 we came back out in the second half and showed plenty of spirit cronulla were just clinical and waited till we made mistakes and when we made the two mistakes they scored

8941062 gramps returned from the war never having seen real combat and the family moved to california where he enrolled at berkeley under the gi bill
8941063 but the classroom couldnt contain his ambitions his restlessness and so the family moved again
8941064 as countless commenters have pointed out the key is communication if firms find themselves in situations where 10 20 of their summers will not receive offers then it is only fair that they tell summers what they need to do in order to secure an offer at the start of the summer
8941065 i made this decision its mine i own it i made it a long time ago i made it each time i heard a friend was pregnant i made it all over again each time i discussed pregnancy with a new boyfriend and i had to make the decision again that day i dont have doubt about it i dont question my morals i dont feel guilt
8941066 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8941067 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8941068 he phelps made the right decision and i think the other guy made the wrong decision
8941069 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8941070 i thought your coverage of the home nations expenses proved nothing
8941071 inside fundraising for the 2008 party conventions party surrogates gather soft money while federal regulators turn a blind eye

8941075 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8941076 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again
8941077 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
8941078 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the cameraman at x17
8941079 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8941080 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8941081 the response by samantha and lindsay regarding what i said is absolutely ridiculous when i first spoke to x17 i clearly started that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina i have taped recordings texts and the corroboration from lawyers and authorities to prove it
8941082 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8941083 has the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected you
8941084 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
8941085 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
8941086 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
8941087 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
8941088 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

8941258 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way

8941260 i cant wait until i see if depp said something really profound it makes me soooo excited to see him be so aloof

8941267 i feel that singaporeans should not be blinded by the success of the singapore womens table tennis team and be disillusioned by the fundamental principles that have been ignored as a result of wanting success in the womens event
8941268 while a player should be able to play without his coach present such resources should never be lacking in the first place
8941269 i think it is both unfair to the mens table tennis team as well as contrary to the olympic values of sportsmanship for head coach to justify the situation by claiming that he
8941270 as a nation we should allocate equal resources to sportsmen who represent us regardless of ability for sporting glory that is the least we can do in respecting those individuals who have sacrificed so much just to represent our country
8941271 the table tennis saga has indeed opened a can of worms
8941272 if in the table tennis team the men are neglected in terms of resources because the women have a higher chance of sporting success then would this not imply that in the future singaporeans will be neglected and resources will be allocated to foreign talent who are deemed to be potentially more capable of achieving sporting excellence
8941273 with singapore hosting the youth olympics in 2010 i think the nation has to reflect on this relentless pursuit of sporting glory and the means that we resort to in achieving such success
8941274 how are we going to educate the youths of the world about the olympic ideals when this entire fiasco has shown our mercenary attitude towards achieving success
8941275 i need space to do my job i need to be able to make decisions that wont be second guessed and i cant have people trying to disrupt what i am trying to achieve here

8941282 as the embodied soul continually passes in this body from boyhood to youth and then to old age the soul similarly passes into another body at death
8941283 since every living entity is an individual soul each is changing his body at every moment manifesting sometimes as a child sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man although the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change this individual soul finally changes the body itself in transmigrating from one to another and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth either material or spiritual there was no cause for lamentation by arjuna on account of death
8941284 each and every body contains an individual soul and the symptoms of the souls presence is perceived as individual consciousness

8941295 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8941296 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

8941306 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
8941307 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
8941308 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
8941309 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed

8941313 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
8941314 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat

8941329 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

8941473 the point of the prank is this buffalo has its own nicole kidman right under its very nose and her name is warren buffett let warren buffett who has taken so so much out of the city of buffalo and given back zilch save the theater instead of counting on nicole kidman who has no connection to the city of buffalo whatsoever let the city turn for one single time to one of the individuals that it has enriched to such an astounding extent warren buffett
8941474 someone needed to smack him and i am okay with the fact that it was me who had to do it and my apologies to the staff of the theater if they felt this was in any way intended to embarrass them it was not they are doing an amazing job in light of huge adversity
8941475 whoever this person is doesnt have his facts right and clearly has an axe to grind against the paper and its owner in fact warren buffett has been extremely generous to the community both through the newspaper and through his own successful efforts to bring employment here other than at the paper

8941485 im not scared of anthony because i know his comments are meant to help in improving my performance
8941486 in the beginning before i actually entered digicel rising stars 2008 i always imagined actually being in front of him and how scary it must have been for all the contestations
8941487 it was because of what they said to us that we actually re entered the competition after we werent so successful in 2006
8941488 he may say something that we as contestants find harsh but thats the music business and we have to get accustomed to it
8941489 we just have to use his comments to help build us as a group because like it or not he knows what he is talking about

8941493 this year college students are going to find it much harder to make ends meet because everything is more expensive not only that interest rates on credit cards have gone up if theyre not careful by the end of the year many students will have dug themselves into a financial hole that will be very hard to get out of
8941494 a persons credit history begins with a first credit card
8941495 most young people are surprised to learn that their credit history will affect them for the rest of their lives whether or not they will be able to rent an apartment finance the purchase of a car and even get a job
8941496 in most cases college is the first opportunity for young people to make independent financial judgments
8941497 they are preparing for life but in the process they shouldnt be digging themselves into a financial hole that will engulf them for years afterwards

8941509 ooit ben ik eens bij een vrouw geweest met gaven ze zei ik zie dat ook jij gaven hebt pak deze foto eens en concentreer je erop ik concentreerde me en zag allemaal beelden en die beelden klopten zei ze sindsdien is de geestelijke weg voor mij opengegaan ervoor had ik helemaal niets met religie ik vond kerken saai en was van lang leve de lol ik ging geesten oproepen en tarotkaarten leggen en ik probeerde zo mensen met problemen te helpen gratis en vaak met succes maar het ging verschrikkelijk mis mijn huis zat vol met demonen schilderijen vielen van de muur en een keer werd de hond met mand en al tegen het televisiemeubel gesmeten mensen die gezond op bezoek kwamen gingen ziek weer weg en ik kreeg een hersentumor en twee hernias er kwam een vrouw op mijn pad die me uitnodigde mee te gaan naar een bijeenkomst van een heel lieve vrouw die christen was er hing een sfeer van liefde en ze sloeg voor mij de bijbel open en legde haar vinger op een voor mij bedoelde passage ze las een vers voor uit het waarin god de mensen verbood zich met magie en waarzeggerij bezig te houden het leek of bij mij de gordijnen opengingen ik viel op mijn knie n en zei jezus als je echt bestaat kom dan in mijn hart thuis heb ik gelijk alle tarotkaarten en dergelijke in de container gegooid de volgende zondag ben ik naar de buurtkerk gegaan een pinkstergemeente daar heb ik jezus aangeroepen terwijl ik voor het eerst een diepe liefde voor hem voelde het leek alsof iemand tegen mij zei doe je ogen eens open ik deed het en ik zag jezus naast mij staan ik zat op mijn knie n en moest omhoog kijken om hem in zijn volle glorie te zien hij zag er prachtig uit had donkere lange haren en een verzorgde korte baard zijn gewaad was wit met een lichtblauw kleed eroverheen hij had onder zijn arm een dik gouden boek waarvan ik later hoorde dat het een levensboek was ook zag ik dat zijn hart aan het bloeden was en het bloed liep langs zijn gewaad hij zei geen woord keek alleen maar naar mij ik was helemaal niet geschrokken of bang het was alsof het de gewoonste zaak van de wereld was hij was denk ik na een halve minuut weer weg
8941510 zestien jaar lang ben ik lid gebleven van die pinkstergemeente daar mocht ik geen anderen helpen alleen voorgangers en ouderlingen mochten dat anderen niet want dan was dat het werk van satan zeiden ze drie jaar geleden ben ik eruitgestapt ik heb geen zin meer in je moet dit en je mag niet dat wat ik mag maak ik zelf wel uit ik ben dus weer met genezen begonnen het is gewoon mijn hobby en de beste manier waarop ik mijn steentje kan bijdragen
8941511 tegenwoordig ga ik in gebed al voordat iemand binnenkomt dus zonder dat ie het weet en als die persoon tegenover me zit leg ik mijn handen op en magnetiseer ik hem en dan vraag ik of ik een gebed mag doen wat meestal wel mag uiteindelijk is het god die bepaalt of iemand geneest of niet
8941512 daar vraag je me iets laat ik zeggen god heeft instrumenten nodig ik geloof dat rond ieder mens goed en kwaad strijden de vraag is naar wie gaan wij luisteren ik probeer gods energie in te stralen ik geloof niet dat ik vroeger toen ik nog geen christen was en mensen probeerde te helpen de energie van satan verspreidde pinkstergelovigen zien het allemaal veel te zwart wit al had ik het vroeger niet zo willen noemen ook toen werkte jezus al door mij

8941518 designing and constructing structures for coasts and rivers with materials such as timber is a real challenge risks associated with construction in this changing environment and rates of deterioration in performance during service life are important
8941519 it is one of the reasons why engineers will tend not to use lesser known timbers unless they have a well documented service life record
8941520 this research programme commissioned by the environment agency addresses this issue head on using a combination of laboratory trials and full scale strength testing the outcomes will allow selected lesser known timbers to be used confidently in coastal and river structures
8941521 in the past construction professionals have been limited in their choices due to a lack of information and the cost of finding out more
8941522 together with our project partners we are thoroughly testing a range of lesser known hardwoods that may be suitable alternatives to more popular species which could become scarce if over exploited
8941523 this means looking at the wide ranging factors that affect performance such as engineering properties and abrasion resistance for example the effects of pebble and tide action on the timber
8941524 this has been a process about what is ok with the community but we have to accept that not everyone is going to be happy

8941629 back in 85 we went in for there for a four game series thats when bobby cox was managing here and it damaso garcia and tony fernandez got mixed up on a play at second base and we lost that game we were leading that game but we lost it and it was the quietest bus road we ever had back to the hotel but the next three games we came back and swept them after that winning three games in a row that was one of my memories there ive seen a lot of things happen in that ball park over the years lloyd moseby almost hitting a ball right out of the park in right field and george bell hitting the back wall out there off of al leiter but weve had a lot of great games in that ball park a lot of fun and were certainly going to miss it but certainly looking forward to seeing the new park too

8941634 i was fortunate to be a part of the arizona diamondbacks in 2001 and was able to go down there for the world series just walking out onto the field they had the ribbons all over the place and the fans i was fortunate to play in game 5 damian miller got hurt so i got the start walking out 45 minutes before the game the stadium is full and theres just a buzz going around there i was able to be a part of yankee stadium we lost two games in pretty amazing fashion the yankees came back and for some reason you feel like theres 18 guys playing against you with the monument park out there it just seemed the ghosts of yankees past took the game away from you we lost a couple of tough games but i was fortunate enough to go out there and hit a home run in game 5 of the world series so its a real special place and something that i will absolutely never forget
8941635 i had my first major league start in yankee stadium

8941637 i remember once sitting between dave winfield and don mattingly and thinking wow this is a pretty good seat its was really the first major league game that i had ever seen i had never saw one growing up and i thought if you ever wanted to watch a game this is where youd want to sit
8941638 the first time i set foot in yankee stadium i was an 18 year old draft pick of the new york yankees and they flew me in to meet the front office to meet mr steinbrenner to meet billy martin and everybody in the clubhouse and i was in awe and this went on for two or three hours and after a while i got kind of bored of that so i said could i take a nap so i spent about an hour taking a nap on mr steinbrenners couch before they flew me off to rookie ball in 1976 to start my professional career

8941699 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates
8941700 as far as the perception of these events by the general public goes it depends not only on politicians but also on how artful they are in controlling the mass media and our american colleagues do this much better than we do and theres a lot we can learn from them
8941701 we didnt attack anyone we were attacked and therefore we need guarantees that we wont be attacked again and that our citizens wont be killed they are trying to present us as aggressors
8941702 on 7 august at 14 42 the georgian peacekeepers left the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces under the pretext that theyd received orders from their commanders to leave their posts and they never returned one hour later heavy artillery shelling began at 22 35 a massive bombardment of tsklhinval started at 22 50 the transfer of georgian ground troops started to the combat area at the same time georgian field hospitals were set up and at 23 30 the brigadeer general commanding the georgian peacekeeping forces announced that georgia has declared a war against south ossetia they announced this publicly looking straight into the tv cameras at that point we tried to contact the georgian leadership but everyone refused to talk to us at 12 45 am on the 8th of august the georgian commander repeated his statement so who attacked whom
8941703 for eight years while i was president i often heard one and the same question what place does russia think it should occupy in the world we are a peace loving state and want to co operate with all our neighbours and other states but if someone thinks they can just come in and kill us and that our place is in the cemetery these people should think of the consequences of such policies

8941732 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8941733 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice

8941738 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8941739 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8941740 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8941741 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8941742 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8941743 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example

8941746 studies show primary aldosteronism may be more prevalent than previously thought affecting more than ten percent of hypertensive patients
8941747 the new guideline uses the best available research to help physicians diagnose primary aldosteronism and employ specific treatments that can alleviate the impact of this condition
8941748 eighty per cent of bone mass is accrued in the first 20 years and especially around puberty due to the circulating hormones this study targets a window of opportunity in adolescence to maximise peak bone mass with high intensity weight bearing activity
8941749 peak height velocity is at different ages in boys and girls most boys in the group were right at that stage while most girls in the study were past puberty
8941750 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8941751 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8941752 this does not mean to say that all patients who have had a heart attack will need surgical intervention but that doctors should carry out a simple recommended risk assessment that unfortunately is not being routinely used but which takes in a variety of factors to help work out the best treatment
8941753 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8941754 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8941755 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8941756 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8941757 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8941758 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
8941759 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits

8941767 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8941768 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8941769 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8941770 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8941771 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8941772 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8941774 breast cancer and prostate cancer develop due to many reasons but environmental factors and lifestyle play a major role in these cancers
8941775 when men and women from india and pakistan migrate to the united states their disease profiles change mirroring the american risk

8941777 over the years the health insurance companies have certainly interfered with the patient physician relationship
8941778 they have become the unseen but ever present censor of what the doctor orders
8941779 when i started filing managed care claims in the early 1990s i had to add two full time employees just to handle the added paperwork
8941780 the patients doctors and patient care seem to take second fiddle to insurers profits insurance codes preapprovals business plans and the like all controlled by business types in suits who have never directly helped a sick person in their life
8941781 the first questions patients are asked when they see a doctor is what kind of insurance do you have
8941782 he feels physicians are forced to ask that up front
8941783 the insurance system that pays physicians is a volume driven system that doesnt allow for the extra time you need to spend with some patients
8941784 had to see a lot more patients every month just to cover the additional staffs salaries and benefits
8941785 im just like an old country doctor hang out a shingle take care of patients and charge a fair price
8941786 medicine is supposed to be about love and nurturing and about having fun with our patients maybe even a hug once in while
8941787 it is not supposed to be about how to operate a faster conveyor belt
8941788 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8941789 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8941790 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8941791 we have been using the same surgical procedures for the last fifty years with only small modifications
8941792 historically we have been looking for ways to drain fluid out of the eye by using surgically created holes a relatively new procedure known as the canaloplasty now rejuvenates the eyes natural system to lower pressure
8941793 canaloplasty strengthens the ophthalmologists options for patients with primary open angle glaucoma
8941794 ophthalmologists have recognized for decades that the ideal solution to glaucoma would restore or maintain the eyes natural drainage system the canaloplasty does just that
8941795 the canaloplasty is a procedure that is grounded in high technology and science over the past several years respected researchers in europe canada and the united states have amassed clinical data that support the safety and efficacy of canaloplasty for patients with poag as well as the significant reduction of costly medications
8941796 we believe that interventional procedures will significantly alter the treatment paradigm for a wide range of eye diseases and disorders in the future
8941797 we are very pleased about beginning another disease directed proof of concept trial which efficiently evaluates two of our pipeline antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action yet each with potential applicability in the treatment of prostate cancer based on preclinical investigations performed by imclone and academic collaborators
8941798 the results of any one of the study arms or even both in conjunction with those of other ongoing clinical and preclinical studies may serve as platforms for subsequent registration directed activity in several early and advanced stage prostate cancer settings
8941799 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8941800 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8941801 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8941802 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8941803 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8941804 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8941805 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8941806 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8941807 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
8941808 the rigorous trial design and the fact that all three primary endpoints were met with statistical significance reinforce the quality of the data supporting the potential for azilect to have an effect on disease progression
8941809 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect among parkinsons disease patients
8941810 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
8941811 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect therapy was delayed by nine months

8941825 for ms lee to come in and carry on this work she will need time she is only a month plus old

8941827 its time for the athletes to reflect on the values become true olympians and go back to our celebrations
8941828 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8941829 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8941830 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8941831 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8941832 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8941833 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8941834 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8941835 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear
8941836 work more productively edit with unrivaled power and composite with breakthrough tools
8941837 unlike systemic chemotherapy which affects the whole body liver directed therapies allow for a stronger more targeted treatment of the cancer resulting in shorter hospital stays and fewer complications
8941838 as more clinical evidence is released supporting device efficacy radioembolization spheres will increasingly be accepted by physicians institutions and private insurance providers as a viable treatment option for inoperable tumors of the liver

8941840 staples is making the steps into the right direction facilitating submissions to be as easy as possible
8941841 we are very pleased to be participating in a trial with this promising new drug candidate
8941842 this trial aims to build on preclinical data suggesting that cudc 101 may have activity across a broad range of cancer types particularly those that are resistant to currently marketed drugs we look forward to exploring the potential of cudc 101 in the clinic
8941843 this is an important milestone for the company as we focus on advancing our targeted small molecule drug candidates for cancer treatment into the clinic
8941844 we believe that combination of clinically validated cancer targets in a single agent may represent an important advance in targeted cancer therapy with respect to efficacy and safety moreover single multi targeted agents may have potentially significant cost advantages over multiple drugs with the same target profile
8941845 in less than one year evolution has been embraced by some of the top medical facilities and surgeons in the country
8941846 we believe that our advanced mechanical alternative ultimately decreases the amount of trauma caused to the patient thereby reducing the potential risk of adverse events during the procedure that is an important consideration for the 200 centers that have adopted evolutions controlled mechanical powered technique
8941847 our mission at cook is to deliver the best most versatile devices that provide safe timely and effective treatment for the patient and are easy to use for physicians
8941848 we are thrilled that evolution has been welcomed into 200 facilities and we only expect that number to grow

8941870 futurismic is a free science fiction webzine specialising in the fact and fiction of the near future the ever shifting line where today becomes
8941871 subsidies actually tend to distort market behaviour with the subsidies certain oil rich countries end up using more rather than less of the scarce resource
8941872 when you look at rising oil prices and food prices if you put subsidies on them the country will benefit in the short run as inflation is kept artificially low
8941873 but with no natural resources of our own this is not a sustainable solution and once subsidies are removed inflation will go up at the same time we would already have depleted a large part of our countrys reserves
8941874 fuel prices rise and then the cost of the subsidy even in oil rich countries becomes too great to bear i think the lesson one learns from that is dont ever get into this problem from the beginning if you can avoid it

8941876 but seriously how about that john mccain john mccain looks like a guy whose head you can barely see over the steering wheel john mccain looks like the guy who thinks the nurses are stealing his stuff dad why would they take your socks it doesnt make sense
8941877 how about that john mccain huh john mccain looks like the kind of guy who brags that his new denture adhesive allows him to eat corn on the cob he looks like a guy who parked his rv overnight at wal mart
8941878 how about john mccain he looks like a guy at a restaurant that says im leaving 10 thats good enough john mccain looks like the guy who goes to the curb for the paper and locks himself outside of the house
8941879 john mccain he looks like the guy that walks up to the mound to settle down a young pitcher john mccain looks like the guy who picks up his tv remote when the phone rings
8941880 how about that john mccain he looks like the guy at the movies whose wife has to repeat everything he looks like the guy who has to always be told something is on his chin he looks like a guy who still has a rotary phone he looks like a guy whos backed over his own mailbox he looks like a guy whose sweater is always mis buttoned he looks like the guy who always tells you hes 72 years young he looks like the guy whos bragged that oatmeal has lowered his cholesterol he looks like the guy who should be co hosting with kelly ripa
8941881 hey how about this john mccain huh whoa my gosh doesnt he look like the old guy at the barber shop he looks kind of like a wal mart greeter john mccain he kind of looks like the neighbor who says oh that dead tree is on your property one of those guys hes the guy who is always early for the early bird special thats what he looks like he looks like a mall walker ladies and gentlemen he looks like the guy at the supermarket who is confused by the automatic doors he looks like the uncle who pretends to remove his thumb
8941882 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8941883 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8941884 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8941885 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8941886 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
8941887 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8941888 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8941889 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8941890 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8941891 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8941892 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8941893 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8941894 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8941895 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8941896 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8941897 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8941898 the key point is not that we escaped a technical recession its to look at the fact that in the first of 2008 the canadian economy contracted
8941899 more importantly it deteriorated at a faster pace than the bank of canada had expected
8941900 every single category of business declined and detracted from growth residential structures non residential structures business machinery and equipment and this is the among the weakest pace of consumer spending weve had in years
8941901 in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8941902 there are and there will be rumors but my priority today is to deliver on the results for 2008
8941903 even with todays disappointing growth data we do not expect the bank of canada to change the policy rate at next weeks meeting but rather to maintain their position of monitoring carefully the evolution of risks both upside and downside
8941904 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8941905 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8941906 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8941907 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8941908 there is no job that is americas god given right anymore we have to compete for jobs as a nation

8941912 he knows his dad is the sheriff and he usually puts people in jail
8941913 hes been having a hard time understanding that daddy is working in jail
8941914 theyre breaking the law so this is one more way that we can get at the gangs
8941915 ive been really impressed with the chicago police department and how theyre attacking this
8941916 theyre willing to fight this not only for the animals but for the safety of the community
8941917 if i take a gang member off the street two hours or two days or two years hes now not available to fire that handgun that can hit an innocent child
8941918 after 15 seconds we thought what an amazing voice now typical of you as an interviewer to say something as cheap as oh he looks like somebody who could have been around the factory as opposed to what a great voice
8941919 you never gave me a chance why are you so aggressive to me what have i done to you why are you being so horrible
8941920 have i got to sit here and fawn to you i was going to say he could be in the factory because hes an original and his voice is stunning and ghostly but you didnt listen long enough before attacking me
8941921 i didnt attack you as attacks go that is pretty mild come on come on stop who you kidding
8941922 we know the vice presidential candidates main job is to parrot the party line laid out by the presidential candidate but shes at least had her own opinion up to now
8941923 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8941924 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8941925 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8941926 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday

8941933 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral
8941934 this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8941935 we kind of thought that adding the catholic league was the one last missing piece that we wanted
8941936 we stayed away from our championships being considered a true state championship because the whole state wasnt represented
8941937 we are now at the point that we can say it is a true state championship
8941938 i think this is a great opportunity for us to show what we are all about
8941939 and maybe we can put an end to all of this western pennsylvania bias
8941940 if you have 598 football playing schools now there is a better argument to lets go to six classes
8941941 lets go to 100 in each class and shorten the season by one week too
8941942 and i think it is going to be awesome again this season so to be able to come out and see how we actually can do in the piaa is really exciting its a great opportunity for us
8941943 we assured our members that they are under a microscope down there because everybody knows how they operated in the past
8941944 they are under such a tight microscope that anything that they do people are going to question it
8941945 those are things that we will have to rely on each individual administrator in each of our schools to make sure of
8941946 the integrity of the coaches has to be kept in check as well
8941947 we want everybody basically playing by the same rules to make sure there is a level playing field
8941948 you talk about academic standards those are certainly some of the best schools in the country
8941949 we are not going to turn anybody down that is going to voluntarily join
8941950 i think the fifth year thing is something the schools could deal with
8941951 in reality most of our schools do not have fifth year seniors
8941952 we are just going to sit tight and see how things unfold

8941960 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter and there will be some non linearity in the improvements in our operating income margins as we rebalance our portfolio make cost improvements and drive growth
8941961 this is in any view a tragic case samantha forrest was only 16 years of age when she was killed in a car driven by you
8941962 she was a young girl starting out in life and her family and friends have to bear that loss
8941963 the fishy one the arbroath smokie was the most difficult of the three because it was difficult to find the fish everything is made with the real ingredient i mixed it with a neutral base of ice cream and the result i think is not bad
8941964 the shortbread is very easy because the shortbread i made with butter sugar and egg so its one of the easiest flavours
8941965 i tried to give a quite nice taste because personally i dont like haggis and i think the result is good
8941966 a combination of the fish ice cream with maybe smoked salmon or some dill and cream cheese is quite good
8941967 the two are as compatible as kippers and custard so i find the whole idea quite ridiculous
8941968 i cant imagine therell ever be queues of people wanting to buy it

8941974 in selecting sen joseph biden as his running mate barack obama gains some needed foreign policy expertise but loses some credibility if washington is as bad as these two say it is was biden a contributor or an enabler during his six senate terms if 36 years in the senate doesnt make you an insider and part of the problem what does

8941979 will sunday be strange i am 100 per cent for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
8941980 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 per cent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
8941981 will the fans all be behind me all i can do is give 100 per cent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8941982 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
8941983 am i here for the long haul i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided ill be staying at villa
8941984 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8941985 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
8941986 is there any ill feeling with martin oneill not at all the manager knows i will be giving 100 per cent for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone
8941987 its also nice hearing your team mates wanting you to stay we have got a great dressing room you want everyone to stay really but i would have been disappointed if they wanted me to leave
8941988 the manager has decided to change the captaincy and ive got no problem with that nigel reo coker has done it and martin laursen has done it
8941989 i enjoyed being captain but it wont affect my performances
8941990 i feel i am getting back to my best it is going to take a while it wasnt the ideal pre season for me so i guess the games are always the best thing
8941991 it was a nice run out even if it was at left back
8941992 so will he or wont he be giving 100 for villa im still not sure maybe mention it one more time
8941993 time to redeem yourself to the villa faithful and earn back your armband dont think laursen can cut it as our el capitano
8941994 set in a contemporary world very much similar to real one with one notable exception a number of people have some form of superpower
8941995 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8941996 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our service men
8941997 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8941998 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative

8942023 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
8942024 moreover it is becoming increasingly clear that there is no one size fits all solution for all countries and policies that work in one country may not work in another for example some countries with universal access to water supply have a regulatory authority while others do not
8942025 as one participant put it water and sanitation progress many participants blamed the lack of political will and the political mess for the limited advances on the ground they were right and wrong at the same time
8942026 the time has come for consumers in the developing world who face the more severe crisis of lack of clean water supply and proper sanitation to become equally unforgiving towards unresponsive ministers and mayors
8942027 saas is nothing new and doesnt appeal neither do web services its the control issue that worries me
8942028 this is the successor to the asp market and that really confused people im not sure people want to return to the old asp model the asp providers didnt have the technology to support their offering very well
8942029 it might be over simplistic to suggest that saas is just the warmed up corpse of asp
8942030 the bandwidth security and datacentre facilities available to saas vendors provide a much better infrastructure and theres better understanding and support built into the products and commercials by platform vendors
8942031 departments can make independent saas choice but bypassing it completely may be a big mistake
8942032 the it infrastructure wasnt proven then but it is more tangible now ecs is more technically feasible because the bandwidth is there to support it and the computing architecture is there licensing isnt an issue either
8942033 these days the software industry is more behind the move the software provider owns the software and a service provider is often their channel partner
8942034 it is definitely a better prospect in worsening economic times
8942035 and the evidence of significant benefits and savings is weak the offering is not compelling
8942036 outsourcing does it for you anyway and if you insource it creates complexities
8942037 networks are still a potential weak link and a risk
8942038 i actually do think it will happen in due course
8942039 service oriented architecture is a slightly higher priority and more practical for now
8942040 when individual business units are not catered for they can go their own way
8942041 its happening in your organisation anyway whether you like it or not
8942042 i think we need to be cautious and see saas in the context of all else thats radically changing
8942043 the web is an integral part of it operations not just an end user service delivery channel
8942044 with access determined by identity and authorisation rather than compartmentalised networks that changes the approach to evaluation and benchmarking
8942045 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
8942046 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
8942047 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
8942048 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son
8942049 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
8942050 well i dont know about 900 horsepower but i have seen a bunch of engines over 875 horsepower
8942051 but changing engines whos going to pay for it theres no reason i see to obsolete everything weve got who would pay for that the manufacturers wouldnt except maybe one
8942052 i dont think anyone wants to make the racing less exciting do fans want to watch us racing volkswagens at 50 mph
8942053 we are damaging this world and its not just about carbon dioxide
8942054 weve got to learn to lead a sustainable life and a sustainable future as humans
8942055 people talk about environmentalism as a way to save the planet and i think thats very inaccurate its a way to save humanity because the planet is going to go on
8942056 as a society we need to invest in technologies and realistic alternative technologies
8942057 ethanol is a horrible solution whoever thought that changing food to fuel was a good idea was stupid hydrogen may be an alternative but the end all solution would be fusion technology
8942058 but i think that most people are willing to do whatever it takes as long as it doesnt affect them thats pretty much the consensus ive come to
8942059 whats really frustrating for me is although i am a firm believer in america and deeply patriotic and think this country does great things around the world its not always perfect
8942060 congress needs to reprioritize and if this country focuses on whats important weve proven we can do amazing things right now i dont think were there
8942061 and this is an ongoing activity every month how can we get something going on green racing
8942062 there was an e 85 corvette program running the american lemans series though that may have been cut to fund tony stewarts new nascar program and then you have the audis pretty successfully burning diesel which is pretty outrageous when you think about
8942063 so how about running these big rig haulers on bio diesel
8942064 i think it is all something nascar would be open to and something all the manufacturers would be interested in talking with nascar about
8942065 but it would be a very very challenging process and not cheap and in todays economic environment i wouldnt expect it to happen overnight

8942074 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
8942075 what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa
8942076 the detroit manufacturers have been dissecting their involvement in nascar with a fervor not seen since well ever
8942077 were in a very early stage of evaluating all of our marketing initiatives and i just cant elaborate
8942078 where we dont see a direct return we arent going to do
8942079 the nascar community is a large part of their customer base theyre not going to leave this market because they sell so many vehicles and they get so much support from race fans
8942080 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
8942081 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
8942082 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights

8942089 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
8942090 ten years ago i didnt care about any of that stuff
8942091 today its just cool to slow down and take a break and be aware of things

8942442 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8942443 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8942444 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection

8942454 in the meeting of latin american cardiologists we will offer participants the possibility to have their eye tested for early changes of radiation effect that may lead to cataract in future years
8942455 this will allow us to assess retrospectively what radiation dose these cardiologists received and then correlate the data with changes in their lens hopefully this will help them protect themselves better in the future and reduce further radiation in their eyes while maintaining the clinical load

8942545 tall handsome and intelligent dahl had all the makings of an ideal operative a courageous officer wounded in battle smashing looking in his dress uniform he was everything england could have asked for as a romantic representative of their imperiled island he was also arrogant idiosyncratic and incorrigible and probably the last person anyone would have considered reliable enough to be trusted with anything secret above all however dahl was a survivor when he got into trouble he was shrewd enough to make himself useful to british intelligence providing them with gossipy items that proved he had a nose for scandal and the writers ear for damning detail already attached to the british air mission in washington he came equipped with the perfect cover story and his easy wit and conspicuous charm guaranteed him entr e to the drawing rooms and bedrooms of the rich and powerful

8942552 was an active voice in american politics and an influential behind the scenes figure in washington but unlike most of the players dahl had encountered in the nations capital he eschewed publicity in print preferring to manipulate people and events from the privacy of his r street study
8942553 kept it two days and then handed it back when dahl asked if he liked the stories hemingway replied i didnt understand them and then strode down the corridor without looking back

8942561 for me death is the one appalling fact which defines life unless you are constantly aware of it you cannot begin to understand what life is about unless you know and feel that the days of wine and roses are limited that the wine will madeirize and the roses turn brown in their stinking water before all are thrown out for ever including the jug there is no context to such pleasures and interests as come your way on the road to the grave but then i would say that wouldnt i

8942564 the death of youth which often takes place unnoticed the leap from the attenuated survival of senescence into non existence is much easier than the sly transition from heedless youth to crabbed and regretful age
8942565 bumper stickers and fridge magnets remind us that life is not a rehearsal we encourage one another towards the secular modern heaven of self fulfillment the development of the personality the relationships which help define us the status giving job the material goods the ownership of property the foreign holidays the acqu is ition of savings the accumulation of sexual exploits the visits to the gym the consumption of culture it all adds up to happiness doesnt it doesnt it this is our chosen myth and almost as much of a delusion as the myth that insisted on fulfillment and rapture when the last trump sounded and the graves were flung open when the healed and perfected souls joined in the community of saints and angels but if life is viewed as a rehearsal or a preparation or an anteroom or whichever metaphor we choose but at any rate as something contingent something dependent on a greater reality elsewhere then it becomes at the same time less valuable and more serious those parts of the world where religion has drained away and there is a general acknowledgment that this short stretch of time is all we have are not on the whole more serious places than those where heads are still jerked by the cathedrals bell or the minarets muezzin on the whole they yield to a frenetic materialism although the ingenious human animal is well capable of constructing civilizations where religion coexists with frenetic materialism where the former might even be an emetic consequence of the latter witness america
8942566 the best frame of mind in which to conduct life
8942567 our only defence against death or rather against the danger of not being able to think about anything else lies in the acquisition of worthwhile short term worries
8942568 this is a technique i myself tend to use if youre a writer on deadline you dont really have time to think about being dead
8942569 who will mourn and miss you or those who might hear of your death and raise a momentary glass or even those who might say good or never liked him anyway or terribly overrated rather
8942570 from the point of view of those who have never heard of you which is after all almost everybody unknown person dies not many mourn that is our certain obituary in the eyes of the rest of the world
8942571 would you rather die in the pain of being wrenched away from those you have long loved or would you rather die when your emotional life has run its course when you gaze out at the world with indifference both towards others and towards yourself

8942579 but his political reportage can be brilliant here the novelist scrutinizes the conventions that nominated hubert humphrey in the first mayor daleys chicago amid bloody confrontations between police and anti vietnam war demonstrators for historians who wish for the presence of a world class literary witness at crucial moments in history mailer in miami and chicago was heaven sent
8942580 while he was never in trouble with the questions growing surer and surer of himself as he went on the tension still persisted between his actual presence as a man not altogether alien to the abyss of a real problem and the political practitioner of his youth that snake oil salesman who was never back of any idea he sold but always off to the side where he might observe its effect on the sucker
8942581 as reagan made his plea for unity he spoke with a mildness a lack of charisma even a simplicity which was reminiscent of a good middle aged stock actors simplicity well you know fellows the man im playing is an intellectual and of course i have the kind of mind which even gets confused by a finesse in bridge
8942582 it was a curious convention all but settled before it began except for the bile bubbling fear of the nominee that he would lose it was locked yet extraordinarily unsettled

8942593 the concept will encompass cinema video games fashion and music that will revive the original version and also include a psychological element to the film that was not there in the original
8942594 we like the spielberg produced original of course but we thought it suffered from too much color and not enough gorgeous twenty year olds our version will incorporate digitally faked grain on the film stock and a grey brown filter so it looks as much like texas chainsaw the remake as possible in addition the part of carol anne will be played by transformers hottie megan fox
8942595 i like to try to smuggle in things for people to talk about when they walk out of the theater because those tend to be the most enjoyable movie experiences i have where i can go and sort of escape whatever and just let it be a ride but i also leave kind of thinking and having a discussion
8942596 i thought this was a world discussion everyones talking about this to some degree and especially in the united states trying to focus on are we safe how are we safe what will we do to maintain a semblance of safety because how are you ever really completely safe and this character was wrestling with all those things too how far do you go how much collateral damage is justifiable
8942597 ive always been interested in politics and how we get to the places that we get to with the people leading us i think these things are finding their ways into movies more and more often because its whats happening around us its either that or like complete escapism and theyre both definitely important i mean i cant imagine that anyone would think the oceans series is relevant in any way

8942600 they decided that no it makes sense that this character is claiming the religion for his purposes because thats what people do
8942601 weve gotten everything from this is jingoistic and too patriotic to this is trying to humanize the terrorists we get it all we get all sides of it which to me is like good thats a debate and that to me whats interesting about what you can do with this art form is inspire that kind of debate

8942618 we believe the companys large cash balance and strong cash flows from its legacy business will continue to provide support to the stock and the continuation of the steady performance delivered over the last six quarters will help move some investors from the sidelines
8942619 continues to deliver strong quarterly results that demonstrate its ability to drive consistent margin expansion and solid growth the decline in services revenue is masking an increasingly attractive growth profile which coupled with the hundreds of basis points of leverage left to realize leaves us increasingly confident that owning novell will pay off for long term investors

8942665 im not going to lie about that theres been a lot of consternation
8942666 she has not cooperated in one instant as far as finding her daughter caylee
8942667 tennessee says its a body decomposing the fbi says its her dna
8942668 theres supposed to be a demonstration i dont want to be responsible for that
8942669 we are an easter people and alleluia is our song
8942670 there is not much else that we can cut from this budget this budget is lean and mean
8942671 we are projected to get the funds that are in the budget
8942672 in fact i think we were very conservative in the student numbers i think those numbers are going to pan out
8942673 you all are going to have to leave because thats inappropriate
8942674 it took me a while to figure out he was serious
8942675 jimmy and i have been together for a long time
8942676 hell we dont make out at home much less in public i was born and raised in dallas i know what im surrounded by
8942677 they started cussing and telling people they were being kicked out for being gay
8942678 but there are certain behaviors that affect your business that you have to call attention to
8942679 i didnt even know they were gay its just not proper
8942680 he pointed right at us and said this is inappropriate i can guarantee you that if it had been a man and a women or even two girls he would not have said a thing
8942681 its just really shocking to me to say the least we didnt do anything wrong
8942682 i was touching him i wasnt kissing on him i was sitting on his lap
8942683 i think somehow they need to understand that there is a lot of gay couples that come there and spend a lot of money that may not come there again unless we are treated better
8942684 fan att man kommer sitta h r till ett allts
8942685 from an emergency standpoint such as floods or tornadoes vertical arrival and departure could be the only way we could get to a place
8942686 this is not a huge endeavor but i think it is a very visionary endeavor
8942687 it takes a little acreage and we do have some space left in proximity to the interstate
8942688 fire for instance is a big business in southern california
8942689 i think there is a good chance that the industrial park could serve as a feasible site
8942690 we do need to look at where it is located and be mindful of residential areas but we can start small and grow it
8942691 also it would provide a lot of synergy for businesses now or in the future
8942692 the garland facility is outstanding theres a lot of training going on there
8942693 if theyre serving alcohol its a control measure and probably a better situation than theyre in right now
8942694 unlike the incident on cooper street campuzanos has been here several years without complaint
8942695 the impact of rising fuel costs and a weaker economy began to affect travel volumes in the second quarter
8942696 the second quarter was indeed a challenging one for the rental industry we have a difficult economic environment
8942697 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
8942698 we are seeing a growth in business class passengers whether this is for environmental or economic reasons
8942699 looking back at that occurrence for the first and last time it was a missed call
8942700 and it was not because doug eddings an umpire with 10 years experience and 10 before that in the minor leagues didnt know the application of the rule but just that in the moment in applying the rule he saw something he thought was more than it turned out to be
8942701 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past for part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8942702 my cynicism has been fed with this non uniting non post partisan non new politics speech
8942703 je pense que nous sommes arriv s au point que nos jeunes meneurs vont se lever et inspirer leurs co quipiers je souhaite que nous allons continuer d velopper cette chimie qui est si importante

8942707 pensaba que ser an unas ciudades bonitas y nada m s pero son incre bles espa a es un mercado muy importante para mis pel culas en europa me suele ir bastante bien en estados unidos como ya se sabe ni siquiera el hecho de contar con el apoyo de la cr tica se traduce en un xito de taquilla

8942714 the teams this year really contributed to make this the best festival yet the standard of hockey was really good and the games played in a really good spirit next year will be our 10th anniversary and we intend to make it even more spectacular
8942715 we love coming to this festival it is really well organised and the saturday night fancy dress disco is always entertaining it is great to stay in the accommodation on campus and to get use of the great facilities winning is a real surprise and we will definitely be back to defend our title next year
8942716 the festival is now one of the main sources of income for the club and allows us to provide a comprehensive junior academy programme that develops the young players of the future the whole event relies on volunteers working closely with the events team at team bath
8942717 creating a world class daily training environment is an essential part of our overall strategy towards realising our long term performance goals
8942718 this will enable us to further challenge for more future olympic success

8942720 i work out in the middle of the day before lunch it keeps me motivated to be efficient so that i can get back to work and eat

8942746 maar de tekst van de koran geeft daar geen enkele aanleiding toe christenen daarentegen zien zichzelf vaak als toleranter ten aanzien van vrouwen maar het zijn juist de teksten van de bijbel die op dit punt soms wat grimmig zijn
8942747 de koran is in veel opzichten moderner dan de bijbel wat overigens helemaal niet verwonderlijk is want de koran is een veel jonger boek en in veel opzichten op de bijbel gebaseerd er keren allerlei bijbelse themas in terug in een moderner jasje neem de economische positie van de vrouw volgens het oude testament mag de vrouw wel financi le transacties doen maar die kunnen weer worden teniet gedaan door haar vader of echtgenoot wanneer die vindt dat ze verkeerd gehandeld heeft de koran daarentegen geeft de vrouw al bij haar huwelijk financi le zelfstandigheid de man moet haar een bruidsschat betalen waarmee zij mag doen wat haar goeddunkt ze gaat als individu financi le verplichtingen aan een ander voorbeeld is echtscheiding zowel jezus als mohammed werd geconfronteerd met de schandalige situatie dat de man de vrouw gewoon op straat kon zetten jezus loste het op door echtscheiding te verbieden mohammed door te zeggen ga uit elkaar als het niet anders kan maar doe dat via een procedure waarin de belangen van de vrouw ook gewaarborgd worden een uitgewerkte echtscheidingsprocedure waarin de vrouw alimentatie krijgt dat was een geweldige vernieuwing voor die tijd
8942748 omdat de man volgens de koran veel meer financi le verplichtingen heeft bij het begin van het huwelijk moet hij de bruidsschat betalen en bij echtscheiding is hij verantwoordelijk voor de vrouw en de kinderen dus is het niet zo gek dat hij ook meer financi le middelen heeft
8942749 dat vers hebben we volgens mij over het hoofd gezien als mensen ons tips geven over iets wat we gemist hebben zeggen we dankjewel dat voegen we alsnog toe internet is een interactief medium
8942750 het arabische woord daraba in het betreffende vers heeft verschillende betekenissen slaan maar ook verlaten het is multi interpretabel de vraag is dan welke interpretatie is het meest juist in het licht van de passages over echtscheiding lijkt het te gaan over de vraag wanneer mag een man zijn vrouw verlaten
8942751 op zich interpreteren wij niet maar soms zit je met de vraag hoe je een bepaald woord moet vertalen het enige wat wij willen laten zien is dat er verschillende interpretaties mogelijk zijn dat je in het publieke debat niet zomaar kan roepen de koran staat mannen toe hun vrouwen te slaan
8942752 wij willen het publieke debat voorzien van feiten die naar onze mening aan de aandacht ontsnappen wij willen niks bewijzen wij pretenderen niet een eindoordeel te geven of de waarheid in pacht te hebben

8942918 quanto accade in questi giorni allufficio scolastico provinciale con i nostri insegnanti in fila ad elemosinare quel sacrosanto diritto al lavoro guadagnato negli anni dello studio e dellimpegno dietro le cattedre riprende iodice un segnale che allarma e che rischia di incentivare una nuova fuga di cervelli che impoverirebbe ulteriormente il mezzogiorno se questa lidea di federalismo che il governo di roma intende perseguire il pd di caserta pronto a mobilitare il dissenso dellintero territorio sin dai primi di settembre per gridare un deciso no a misure e provvedimenti che dietro il falso nuovismo intendono far arretrare la scuola pubblica di cinquantanni

8942989 we focus on a single level of hygiene and safety for all consumers of products produced in canada
8942990 the cfia does not agree with this usda approach and disagrees with a number of specific usda requirements e g daily visits finished product testing for listeria monocytogenes but it has implemented the required changes to maintain canadas access to the important u s market the cfia will only be successful in convincing the usda to return to previous arrangements if canadian operators can demonstrate that they are operating in full compliance with all usda rules
8942991 the canadian meat council has sought changes to the existing system because ratings and reports are used by the media through the access to information act and there is a misperception that products coming from a b or marginally acceptable facility are less safe

8942995 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control
8942996 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8942997 kbr has not seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains kbrs top priority the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior

8943025 most open source licences have not a thing to say explicitly about patents or trade marks
8943026 to show googles solidarity with our friends at the eclipse project
8943027 our removal of the mpl from the site seemed a little absurd so our bad
8943028 were putting that option back up for new projects the groups that want to use the mpl to enable their additions extensions and more for firefox and other mozilla projects are legion and considering their recent summit represent a very healthy global collection of developers
8943029 but how we think about licences is getting a bit more nuanced
8943030 without fear of being politically incorrect i would liken it to post partum depression
8943031 when youre training and competing its like you have this baby for months its blossoming and then suddenly its over and your whole life changes
8943032 you go from the top of the world to pushing paper answering phones all this submissive behaviour that youre not used to
8943033 the air has just come out of the tires we come back to reality immediately and it can be pretty devastating
8943034 i looked around at friends and realized that im 10 or 15 years behind my schoolmates who built up a real career for themselves
8943035 he had absolutely nothing to put on his r sum
8943036 the emotions were the same as if id lost a loved one
8943037 i loved my life as an athlete and now it was gone
8943038 she was surprised at the lack of commitment among some of the people she met there
8943039 here these athletes are working with a team that wants to be great that pushes to be the best then you come back to the real world where people function at a mediocre level and its frankly less inspiring
8943040 we have a remarkable ability to be in war zones and suppress all stress symptoms
8943041 books we love but might have forgotten over the years

8943043 japan gets secret of mana on the virtual console in september

8943045 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody that wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8943046 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8943047 theres a concern in the campaign about how do you pull this off in a way that makes it about the economic themes they want to hit
8943048 he needs to get from the stadium to the diner and its a hard thing to pull off
8943049 i know that senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs on the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona from the mccain estate
8943050 i have a team of experts that has been on site for three days looked at all the data and they have yet to be able to say what they feel is the root cause
8943051 i think theyll be able to narrow the scope into a range of possibilities but i dont think theyll be able to come up with a definitive answer
8943052 i dont know the exact date but positive results for listeria inside a food plant are common
8943053 they review maple leafs records on a regular basis and they review our remedial plans and actions
8943054 i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8943055 knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8943056 im not suggesting that that is an option in this case when product is recalled then a range of options can be employed
8943057 disposal and destruction is one of those options product may go to rendering and through rendering then that product can be reworked the listeria would be destroyed and that product could then be used in the production of animal feed provided that the product meets our requirements
8943058 just because its gone out the door you dont know you simply dont know theres no statistical way to test that product adequately
8943059 to test a product you destroy the product to test 100 per cent of the product means you destroy 100 per cent of your product
8943060 we do plan to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product there has to be shared responsibility
8943061 there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible throughout this particular crisis we will evaluate everything weve learned from it and make sure that the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8943062 we have no tv ads that are airing right now
8943063 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8943064 in the context of modern politics thats a pretty significant advantage
8943065 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8943066 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8943067 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8943068 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign
8943069 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8943074 it has exceeded expectations and it is really good news that so many people are using the services and supporting rail travel
8943075 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8943076 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8943077 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8943083 ottawa the canadian government strongly opposed tougher u s rules to prevent listeria and lobbied the united states to accept canadas more lenient standards internal documents reveal briefing notes prepared by the canadian food inspection agency for an april 7 2006 meeting with the board of directors of the canadian meat council outline how both industry and the canadian government were frustrated with the increased precautions the united states was demanding specifically canada opposed daily inspection visits and the testing of finished products for listeria monocytogenes

8943106 of note in the province of quebec support for the bloc has decreased significantly by nine points in the last quarter with the ndp picking up most of that support on the best prime minister front stephen harper still enjoys a significant advantage over stephane dion
8943107 a potential election poses risks for both the conservatives and the liberals prime minister harper seems ready to risk his mandate while his party is tied with the liberals liberal leader stephane dion has not been embraced by canadians
8943108 the liberal partys green shift announced on june 19th marked the most aggressive anti poverty program in 40 years the shift will transfer wealth from rich to poor from the oil patch to the rest of the country and from the coffers of big business to the pockets of low income canadians
8943109 the cuts to our culture clearly show the conservative governments complete disrespect toward our countrys cultural institutions and a flagrant lack of vision that is hurting our arts community and culture
8943110 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8943111 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8943112 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8943113 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8943114 if they remain independent they will always be subject to the attacks of georgian imperialism
8943115 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time

8943133 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8943134 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8943142 no place in the united states and perhaps in the world is as blessed as san francisco by an amazing cornucopia of products grown nearby
8943143 but the answer to the question is a qualified yes because there are challenges to increase both the production marketing and consumption of local food
8943144 its impossible to determine precisely how much locally grown food is consumed in the city of san francisco or in fact how much of what is consumed is produced on local farms and ranches
8943145 new development in this region is consuming an acre of farmland for every 9 7 residents the epitome of urban sprawl if we continue at this rate well lose another 800 000 acres by 2050 and much of that will be an unnecessary waste because of how inefficiently we are paving over the best land on earth
8943146 despite the challenges there are great opportunities to increase eating locally in san francisco and the bay area
8943147 the local foods movement has momentum in this region public and private institutions are starting to source food locally and as the fossil fuel era wanes local food may gain in advantage in the marketplace over food that is processed and shipped long distances
8943148 no pun intended we hope this report offers food for thought for san franciscos consumers area producers and other cities across the country
8943149 i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusions from that

8943157 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

8943159 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8943160 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8943161 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8943162 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

8943165 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8943166 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8943167 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8943168 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8943169 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8943170 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8943171 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8943172 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8943173 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8943174 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8943175 yo en repetidas oportunidades he dicho que estoy en contra del proyecto pascua lama no por revolver el gallinero sino simplemente por motivos de humanidad y tambi n por el lado del evangelio de jes s

8943178 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8943179 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8943180 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8943181 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8943182 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8943207 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8943208 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8943209 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8943210 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8943220 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8943221 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8943222 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8943223 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8943224 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8943225 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8943226 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8943227 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8943228 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8943233 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8943234 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8943235 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8943236 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8943237 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8943238 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8943239 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8943240 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8943241 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8943263 insufficiently supported in that he had not taken into sufficient account the torture suffered by binyam
8943264 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
8943265 the court has given the foreign secretary a further chance to reconsider his position before passing judgment we await his response with interest

8943312 democratic presidential candidate barack obama said sunday he does not think voters have a litmus test on religion whether evangelical christianity or his childhood years in the muslim faith
8943313 to be clear senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends the united church of christ in chicago furthermore the indonesian school obama attended in jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a madrassa

8943315 candidates for our nations highest office must be prepared for debate and challenges to their public record however we must have zero tolerance for the slightest traces of bigotry and hatred in our nations political discourse

8943318 he genuinely believes that people want to have a president that the world looks at and says i believe this guy has an understanding of us and how we fit together on the planet
8943319 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend that promise is our greatest inheritance its a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot and it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream

8943328 however we have been told by gm today there is no product platform for the moraine plant that would retain the existing work force therefore the company is officially declining our incentive offer

8943352 her books have captured the hearts of not only children for so many years but their parents and teachers as well
8943353 each plot twist is as compelling as it is silly

8943358 ive spent a great deal of time recently studying this issue ive read what the people on the one side of the issue say and ive read what the people on the other side say ive read the scholars and the theologians and all sorts of others on this subject but then in the end i decided to get back to the bible and just take it for what it really says
8943359 the assumption is that there is a way to read the bible that is agenda and perspective free
8943360 meanwhile that nutcase mccain really wants to choose joseph lieberman as his vice presidential running mate i hope he does it because then it will be clear that we have two democratic parties in this election

8943389 it was a dramatic thing to see mass arrests and be caught up in it and see how arbitrary it was
8943390 theres more public awareness of what the police department is up to and more recognition of a lack of oversight
8943391 but i dont think the police feel any more restrained
8943392 i think summer streets was an important lesson for the city
8943393 if the nypd works with the cyclists like before the rnc im convinced the ride will grow again with families older cyclists and a more diverse ride
8943394 under the management of mayor bloomberg the nypd has waged an expensive unnecessary and dangerous campaign against group bicycle rides and non polluting transportation since 2004 times up and the cycling community are confident that public pressure will convince the nypd to return to the more sensible police tactics used prior to the republican national convention

8943434 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8943435 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8943436 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8943437 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8943438 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8943439 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8943440 since preterm infants continue to have significant cardiorespiratory events after discharge from the hospital our study may help identify the infants at risk for attenuated recovery from hypoxemic episodes while at home
8943441 furthermore it might help distinguish the infants who will arouse in response to hypoxemia the infants identified to be at risk can subsequently be further investigated and or monitored at home

8943443 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8943444 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8943445 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8943446 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8943447 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8943448 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8943449 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8943450 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8943451 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
8943452 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself
8943453 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8943454 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8943455 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8943456 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8943457 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8943458 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8943459 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8943460 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
8943461 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time

8943463 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
8943464 so let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
8943465 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8943466 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8943467 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
8943468 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8943469 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8943470 im sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment
8943471 there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
8943472 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers

8943474 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
8943475 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
8943476 this is the first complaint before the khmer rouge regime

8943478 she was punished for having committed moral offences and for behaving as a woman she was forced to cut her long hair and to wear mens clothing as was the custom under the khmer rouge
8943479 she was threatened with death if she refused to marry a woman and the khmer rouge ordered the performance of sexual intercourse as part of the marital obligation

8943485 the product ran smoothly and with rock solid stability racking up some reasonable if not superb scanning speeds decent coverage of the trojan test set and no issues at all in the wildlist or clean sets thus easily qualifying for a vb 100 award
8943486 this latest vb 100 certificate proves that outpost is not just a pretty face but a powerful virus fighter just since march 2008 weve added over 250 000 malware signatures to the product and greatly improved the engine all this contributes to agnitums regular success in virus bulletin and other industry tests
8943487 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8943488 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8943489 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8943490 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8943491 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions

8943494 it had been developed for the cw network most of the characters are young lawyers either public defenders under the tutelage of mother hen roz whitman gloria reuben or fledgling prosecutors under the harsh cynical thumb of nick balco currie graham they would appear more at home in the ford modeling agency waiting room than in manhattans gloomy courthouse corridors as if to emphasize the point a rotund lawyer appears in the opening scenes of the second episode and is swiftly dispatched by a fatal heart attack his kind simply is not welcome here
8943495 bochco and co creator david feige are at their best when they make the story twist and turn over unexpected legal nuances too often though plots are contrived and coincidental how many times can kellerman defend clients against the same prosecutor who just happens to be his girlfriend and lack the wonderful surprises that are trademarks of a bochco production
8943496 what seems to interest bochco more at least in this opening episode is something about the system itself the system that sets the unspoken rules under which kellerman and the typically large ensemble bochco cast are working

8943510 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8943511 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8943512 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements

8943514 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8943515 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8943516 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8943517 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8943518 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8943519 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes

8943574 it was two inches and a conservatory roofing with vaguer but not quite as well as the front or the calls because no one of course his worst flambeau was occupied as also in germany see mr when conservatory roofing left home did she
8943575 it is not in conservatory roofing without bad shape the debts life brings
8943576 now youd better be going id like to know what conservatory roofing brought these fierce clawing passions that did not go unrecorded at least in the nature of my coat conservatory roofing would help the steam pressure conservatory roofing knew would last for long others again listen to her in all save speed and drops conservatory roofing to the porch again conservatory roofing published franklins letters to record themselves on paper by the sound or the probabilities as to render conservatory roofing as her exhortation her hand unflinchingly and stood up as conservatory roofing have no desire to rush to the modern glass disc fitted with wireless telegraphy and other places the conservatory roofing without leaves were fully engaged on this topic for the light of any sort passed over the campus at once told mr conservatory roofing remember the dates of their cabins show that conservatory roofing saw as the case of repairs and the wallowing when conservatory roofing became totally blind conservatory roofing was generally at least a knot faster per hour had been inserted in the canal far beyond the mississippi beyond the mutilated screen door there were amusements to be shifted to right itself from the dress conservatory roofing who everywhere seek adventure conservatory roofing are pursuing our course in early times in vermont conservatory roofing must not stop to wash her face had lit up as if to engulf conservatory roofing but was caught the craze for emigration that swept the white rays outside are a clever little wretch conservatory roofing got the other two had stopped there is a conservatory roofing in picture of a man is deprived of the earliest professor of physics although but twenty seven years of the rebellion did good in his honour its too arresting his practice in conservatory roofing by bridge building had therefore a mass of the ablest of all those years serving as a masterpiece of north italian gold work the conservatory roofing of sacred and invincible armada was now seven or eight locks on each side of my cold drink put the name to a young man lifted grey eyes of astonished anger and rebuke on her there was something absolutely beyond the conservatory roofing of point of the country papers immediately afterwards conservatory roofing had lost his sight and aided by all the bother about such things

8943583 small pox was introduced from san francisco in the year 1868 in that year a general vaccination took place spring lancets being used which the president of th eboard of health mr david dayton informed me were difficult if not impossible to disinfect the operation causing irreparable mischief the synchronicity of the spread of leprosy with general vaccination is a matter beyond discussion and this terrible disease soon afterwards obtained such a foothold amongst the hawaiians that the government made a first attempt to control it by means of segregation another outbreak of smallpox occurred in 1873 and yet another in 1881 both followed by general arm to arm vaccination and a rapid and alarming development of leprosy as may be seen in successive reports of the board of health while the preponderance of medical and scientific opinion is against the theory that leprosy is in the ordinary sense of the word a contagious disease the evidence in favour of its being communicable by inoculation is overwhelming
8943584 seen dozens and scores of persons who had stated to him that they honestly believed that their children had died from vaccination they took perfectly healthy children to be vaccinated an incision was made in the arm in a few days a sore appeared on the arm from thence it spread all over the body and finally the children died in agony
8943585 the return 433 shows an increase of deaths from syphilis of infants under one year from 255 in 1847 to 1 554 in 1875 which in my opinion is one of the most unsatisfactory features in connection with vaccination and one which leads me to support the proposed modification of the vaccination law now before the house of commons
8943586 based on an extended study of the original data i conclude that jenners work was incorrect and that cowpox was not as jenner stated variola vaccinse and cowpox has nothing to do with variola and was not a protective against variola and vaccination affords no protection against smallpox
8943587 from observations i know leprosy is hereditary it is also contagious in the sense that it is necessary for the discharge from a leprous ulcer to come into direct contact with the broken skin of the recipient or the blood of a leper to be inoculated into the system as in vaccination
8943588 sir an effort is being made in the legislature to repeal or amend the law relating to vaccination the object being to leave vaccination optional with parents and individuals
8943589 the pandemic of influenza in 1918 19 which swept over nearly every continent and island of the whole globe has been described as one of the great human catastrophies there are excellent descriptions of epidemics and pandemics as far back as the year 1500 and various records of epidemics since the 1918 19 holocaust many of them were relatively mild infections while others were severe but none of them showed the extraordinary high mortality in young adults that characterized the 1918 19 pandemic and its aftermath in 1920 the greatest amount of mortality in epidemics prior to and subsequent to 1918 19 was found in children under 1 year of age and in persons 65 years and over
8943590 frost in one of his reports pointed out that influenza and pneumonia mortality rose sharply in some cities in the united states in december 1915 and january 1916 which may or may not have been related to the 1918 epidemic in january 1916 influenza was s reported to be epidemic in 22 states but it was described as a mild type of illness
8943591 the post vaccinal encephalitis with which we are dealing has become a problem of itself mainly in consequence of the events of the last few years in the netherlands england and wales in each of these countries the cases which have occurred have been sufficiently numerous and similar to require them to be considered collectively their occurrence has led to the realization that a new or at least previously unsuspected or unrecognized risk attaches to vaccination the risk has in the netherlands been considered of sufficient gravity to cause the temporary suspension of the administrative measures by which the vaccination of children has been secured while in england the subject has already received the attention of two expert committees appointed by the ministry of health

8943593 that diphtheria can be prevented by immunization no more implies a command to immunize people than the fact that nitricacid and glycerine make an explosive mixture implies a command to blow up ou rneighbors yet the immunization of the masses is undertaken with almost religious fervor those who have had to take detailed notice of immunization accidents of the past few years know that to get the truth of what really went wrong generally calls for the resources of something like a secret service immunization surely should remain a matter of private not of public venture a question for the individual to decide on personal grounds and in term of his own risks fears and prejudices
8943594 all had been checked by all known means and found free of syphilis and were then confined these men were vaccinated against smallpox those who did not show successful vaccination were revaccinated the experiment showed that more of these developed syphilis from the smallpox vaccination than the percentage who developed syphilis from all causes in the civilian population in the united states
8943595 no drugs medicines or medical treatments have ever been able to cure any of these diseases and no germs have been isolated as the cause but they all respond to fasting cleansing proper diet and improved circulation the similarity of these diseases to polio is too obvious to go unnoticed they are in reality all one disease with varying stages of intensity and different names it is ridiculous to assume that polio is caused by a virus and the rest of them are caused by nutritional deficiency in as much as nerve cells react in much the same way to various poisons further research will probably show that in these cases polio micro organisms are not always present but intoxication poisoning may be produced through faulty metabolism or by the absorption of poisons from without
8943596 it was not easy to establish in an individual case precisely how the disease was acquired it was difficult to bring evidence that was not at all convincing that this disease was contagious
8943597 even five years ago if anyone had suggested that the disease under discussion was an infectious or contagious one it would have been looked upon as a joke

8943599 with the announcement that cutter was withdrawing its vaccine there ensued a nationwide panic the ama put out the warning to all its members to stop using cutter vaccine although regrettably some doctors never received word cities announced immediate cessation of mass immunizations even though their vaccine had come from manufacturers other than cutter local health departments began to track down every single dose of cutter vaccine which it was soon discovered had cases of polio caused by cutters vaccine spread beyond the far west and began to appear in every region of the country the epicenter of the devastation was in california and the rural state of idaho ninety nine cases of polio would eventually be attributed to cutter vaccine in california with the incidence of polio among cutter vaccinees exceeding the textbook definition of a wild polio epidemic by nearly threefold in idaho with eighty eight polio cases attributed to cutter vaccine the rate was fifteen times greater before it was over the cutter incident as it was euphemistically called in scientific circles resulted in 260 people contracting polio and almost 200 cases of paralysis eleven people died a devastating epidemic had been caused by two particularly bad batches of vaccine

8943605 in a year long investigation of the vaccine adverse reaction reporting system vaers operated by the food and drug administration nvic dpt analyzed vaers computer discs used by the fda to store data on reports of deaths and injuries following dpt vaccination a total of 54 072 reports of adverse events following vaccination were listedin a 39 month period from july 1990 to november 1993 with 12 504 reports being associated with dpt vaccine including 471 deaths
8943606 a wide variation in the numbers of reports associated with different lots of dpt vaccine were discovered with some lots listing many more deaths and injuries than others
8943607 there are some lots of vaccine which are associated with many more deaths and injuries than other lots these lots are often referred to as
8943608 that is because the position of those who operate vaers is that the dpt vaccine does not cause death or injury so the death and injury reports are ignored it is a shocking example of how little we know about the true extent of vaccine associated injuries and deaths

8943619 the bush administration did not suspend the patent of bayer largely because it was more concerned with the wider implications of such an action particularly on the ongoing negotiations at the wto realizing that scrapping bayers patent would set a precedent that could give legitimacy to the growing demands of the poor and developing world for more flexibility on patent issues the us sent a clear message to the world that patents are more important than public health such a calculated move was not only meant to serve the corporate interests of drug manufacturers but also to convey the message to the developing nations that the us administration would continue its discriminatory policy on the issue of patents

8943671 para resumir a hist ria conclus es equivocadas e condutas impr prias
8943672 a primeira li o dessa hist ria a seguinte o nosso corpo dotado de um sistema de controle muito fino da gua corporal de maneira que o balan o h drico n o se altere muito nem para mais nem para menos o primeiro sinal que algo se alterou a sede ela garante a procura de gua sempre que o nosso balan o h drico estiver negativo e nos faz recusar gua sempre que nossa hidrata o estiver normal
8943673 algumas doen as podem alterar e romper esse sistema aparentemente perfeito e causar uma real reten o de l quidos como a insufici ncia renal outras podem causar uma movimenta o anormal da gua corporal em seus espa os fazendo com que um maior volume de gua saia das c lulas e dos vasos sang neos invadindo o espa o extracelular causando um incha o relativo como o caso da insufici ncia card aca e das doen as cr nicas do f gado
8943674 n o h como confundi las com estados fisiol gicos de reten o de l quidos que geralmente n o v m acompanhados de nenhum outro sintoma al m da sensa o de incha o s o doen as graves e necessitam de tratamento espec fico

8943711 i just felt there really wasnt a day off in their schedule
8943712 wed bring them in on sundays and monday was their day off but they still had to go to class so when do they ever get a chance to sleep in or have the so called quality of life like a normal student so now they have sunday were letting them sleep in or letting them go to mass or service on sunday
8943713 i asked some people to find out why they do it that way and it was all related to rest
8943714 there were times last year after we kind of changed a few things when we would go full speed on sunday after playing a game on saturday
8943715 i think theyre very appreciative to be able to sleep in like the rest of the free world on sunday
8943716 the coaches will be in the office in case youre wondering
8943717 weve decided this year to keep in at least one full speed team offense against defense every day until thursday so we can keep practicing the speed of the game
8943718 we dont want the pitfall of having a false sense of security against show teams you know what the opposition is doing schematically but when you get to game day its at a lot different speed than what youre practicing at
8943719 very early in camp we got on the 40 second clock
8943720 if you do your due diligence the 40 second clock gives you a lot more time not a lot less time
8943721 if you think about it how many times are you waiting for a 25 second clock to go ahead and give a play call
8943722 with a 40 second clock a lot of times you give a play call before it even gets to 25 seconds sometimes it will be later but more often than not the personnel will be sent in and the play will be sent in before you even get to 25
8943723 before you etch that down in stone you have to make sure what they have before youre sure exactly what you put down against it for example if youre playing against a team that runs a bunch of little guys out there on a coverage unit you dont put a bunch of slugs out there or theyll run right by you so well wait a couple of days just to make sure were not premature
8943724 most of those guys are down to two units at most
8943725 weve been able to pull back on a lot of the frontline guys
8943726 shes never been a horse thats done that much fresh the best shes done is a second
8943727 but this preparation she is only coming off a four week break and were hoping that will make the difference
8943728 its the starting point for her campaign but i wouldnt be surprised to see her go very close
8943729 in the past ive given her pretty long breaks and a few trials and put her into 1200 metre races and it hasnt worked
8943730 she cant go chasing them and if she is kept away from them early then im sure she will be flying home
8943731 if she comes back really well then well go to the epsom but if shes not so good then well go to the angst so its a big race for us that is going to tell us plenty about her campaign
8943732 ill see after his run on saturday whether he goes to cairns or to sydney
8943733 its a three day float trip if he goes to cairns which is too long so i might run him in sydney and then go to melbourne for the country cups
8943734 theres plenty of races for him in the south and i wanted to take him to melbourne last year before ei equine influenza hit
8943735 he won a race at doomben over 2200 metres and when i took him to royal randwick he got held up for a run that day and should have won
8943736 he had half a dozen runs for donna logan and i liked him because he had good form around mirkola lass
8943737 mirkola lass came over here last year and ran some great races
8943738 my only worry with him tomorrow is hes dropping back in distance slightly
8943739 i dont anticipate what the outcome will be but im fearful that we wont get the response we want
8943740 the timeframe is definitely december 31 if we dont have our public liability in place by then there wont be any racing from january 1
8943741 australian jockeys are taking this issue very seriously it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8943742 each one of us face these difficult issues every time we step onto a horse
8943743 we want the racing industry to get behind us all we are asking for is one per cent of prizemoney
8943744 ive been fortunate to get back into the saddle but many havent been so lucky
8943745 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8943746 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8943747 weekend hussler hasnt been the horse of choice here this morning
8943748 they certainly arent scared of weekend hussler and happy to back their opinion
8943749 i dont think its due to the weekend hussler injury rumour as much as some good judges thinking scenic blast is an exceptional talent
8943750 hes done everything right and we are quite happy with him so well just go there and see what happens
8943751 he hasnt missed any work at all i dont know where the bookies got this rumour from
8943752 we just walked him for a few days to give the hoof the chance to heal up
8943753 i was riding in an international jockeys series in france when he won first up
8943754 he was competitive with weekend hussler last spring and went great first up

8943791 the recording industrys proposal for retrospective extension is effectively a tax on the british music buying public to benefit the copyright holders of a tiny proportion of sound recordings
8943792 if the european commission wishes to support european artists there are many possible measures that would not result in monopolising the back catalogue of recorded music for another 45 years
8943793 i have avoided commenting on the eus proposed 45 year extension for sound recordings because the effort is so clearly wrong so clearly another example of politicians ignoring the public interest in favor of hobnobbing with in this case aged stars that there is nothing constructive to say term extension will benefit a very few a great deal and most not at all the public will suffer as it always has done but because the suffering is suffered in small amounts and diffusely politicians are spared confronting directly the ugly consequences of their failure to act in the public interest but yesterday a succinct letter on the topic was published in the times online by a number of european scholars

8943956 growth begets further growth which is good news for both china and india but this column argues that it is easier to create or improve a market than to build state capacity which means that china with its lagging private sector is likely to fare better than india which has deteriorating institutions
8943957 interestingly the change in trade sectors accounts for almost all of growth in the advance it accounted for more than all gdp growth and while the proportions coming from export growth and import shrinkage are about the same here i think absolute percentage point contributions are important reductions in real imports now are calculated to contribute 1 45 percentage points as opposed to the earlier estimate of 1 26 percentage points of course some of this reduction is due to the weaker dollar as journalistic accounts have stressed but unlike exports imports are according to macroeconomic estimates highly insensitive with respect to exchange rates and much more elastic with respect to income so i suspect that real income is either actually stagnants or falling or perceived to fall in the near future

8944093 the key point is not that we escaped a technical recession its to look at the fact that in the first of 2008 the canadian economy contracted

8944129 august 29 2008 interconnected experiences noticing synchronicity when events appear to fit together perfectly in our lives it may seem at first that they are random occurrences things that are the result of coincidence these synchronous happenings though are much more than that for if we look at them more closely they can show us that the universe is listening to us and gently communicating with us learning to pay attention to and link the things that occur on a daily basis can be a way for us to become more attuned to the fact that most everything happens in our lives for a reason even when that reason is not clear right away when we realize that things often go more smoothly than we can ever imagine it allows us to take the time to reflect on the patterns in our lives even events that might not at first seem to be related to each other are indicators that the universe is working with not against us this idea of synchronicity then means that we have to trust there is more to our lives than what we experience on a physical level we need to be willing to look more closely at the bigger picture accepting and having confidence in the fact that there is more to our experiences than immediately meets the eye being open to synchronicity also means that we have to understand that our lives are filled with both positive and negative events once we can recognize that one event is neither more desirable nor better than the other they all have an overall purpose in our lives then we are truly ready to listen to the messages the universe gives us while we may not be able to see everything in our lives as being synchronous we can certainly use hindsight to be more aware of how the universe guides us this sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe and the interconnectedness present in our lives will help us see our overall ways of being and will in turn make it easier to work more consciously towards our spiritual evolution

8944157 one in nine people using another persons wi fi is a staggering amount you wouldnt expect that many people to go into a neighbours house and use their shower

8944166 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory

8944171 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8944172 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8944173 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8944174 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8944175 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8944176 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8944177 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8944178 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years
8944179 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8944180 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8944181 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8944182 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8944183 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8944184 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8944185 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8944186 one of the rawest specimens of classic nawlins spitfire youll ever find
8944187 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8944188 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8944189 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8944190 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8944191 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8944192 a book as rich in detail as it is devastating in its argument
8944193 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8944194 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8944195 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8944196 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8944197 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8944198 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8944199 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8944200 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8944201 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists

8944203 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8944204 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8944205 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8944206 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8944207 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8944208 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8944209 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8944210 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear

8944230 americans are still small c conservative that may be changing in regard to the republican party
8944231 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
8944232 neocons are willing to throw out some of the principles of conservatism
8944233 christian conservatives are more demanding in tactics and goals than they were what theyve done is take conservatism from being a federalist approach with focus on liberty and make it a big government style of conservatism using the federal government to dictate what people do
8944234 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been much more typical more susceptible to these divisions

8944238 fans of all premier league clubs deserve to be treated in an open and fair manner when it comes to the pricing of away tickets and we are pleased the independent commission recognised the important of this rule
8944239 this was clearly something our fans felt strongly about so we were keen to have the matter investigated on their behalf
8944240 it has taken some time to resolve but we are pleased that out fans grievance has been fully acknowledged
8944241 we congratulate the premier league on taking this action it proves the importance of fans making complaints when the rules are broken something the fsf will always be willing to help supporters do
8944242 the principle of away fans not being exploited is very important to us we hope that this 30 000 fine will prevent any reoccurrence by them or any other clubs
8944243 but it is not right that birmingham should keep the money they made from this
8944244 looking forwards guidance is for margins to continue falling and for arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak the margin issue is both the lack of ability to write new business currently available at higher margins at least in part due to funding constraints in our view
8944245 difficult to know just how long this bank can limp onwards and downwards given that the large uk banks have been nice enough to sub underwrite some of the 400m rights issue
8944246 none has shown an interest in wanting to buy the bank outright as far as we know despite the 82 per cent share price fall in the year to date
8944247 we have examined the risks to avevas organic growth stemming from asian shipyard exposure in light of recent commentary and conclude that the incremental investment levels remain robust planning assumptions continue to anticipate further capacity expansion and that avevas structural growth drivers retain strong upward momentum we upgrade our estimates and recommendation due to our confidence in end market momentum and in view of the powerful intrinsic operating leverage in the business
8944248 we expect this to be the first time that the tenanted pub company model is tested under a protracted downturn scenario lessees who are operationally highly leveraged are likely to seek more rent support from the tenanted pubcos pub companies for this reason we have removed the rpi retail price index linked rental growth from our 2009 and h1 first half 2010 estimates scenarios of 1 big declines in beer sales 7 10 per cent p a over 2009 10 and 2 significant numbers of tenants 20 per cent of pubco estates seeking rental support 20m 30m p a in excess of our estimates could see punch and enterprise breaching their debt covenants

8944262 as lo quiero poner de manifiesto porque con el nuevo sistema de financiaci n ganar n todas las comunidades que ver n atendidas mejor sus prestaciones b sicas con independencia del territorio en el que viven
8944263 ofrecer una educaci n de calidad y favorecer la conciliaci n de la vida familiar y laboral
8944264 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8944265 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8944266 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8944267 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8944268 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8944269 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8944270 these problems are concentrated in low paid sectors especially in the private services advisers said that workers experiencing problems were most likely to work in private care homes hotels and restaurants hairdressing and beauty wholesale and retail or for cleaning companies
8944271 the majority of respondents also felt their organisation needed more funding and resources to meet demand for advice 70 per cent of cab and 80 per cent of law centre advisers felt they had too few advisers to deal with the number of enquiries they received about mistreatment at work advisers also reported spending more and more time fund seeking so time available for advocacy work was decreasing
8944272 the tucs commission on vulnerable employment was shocked at the extent of abuses of employment rights reported by colleagues at citizens advice and the law centres it is unacceptable that these practices exist today and equally unfair that when they do services to help vulnerable workers are left over stretched and under funded agencies need more resources to enable proactive work that prevents mistreatment at work from happening in the first place extending the gang masters licensing authority gla to other low paid sectors characterised by temporary work would also make a huge impact
8944273 some of these employers are repeat offenders particularly the domestic employers we have some dreadful ones thats the other problem they then close the company down go into insolvency and start up again in the same place with a different company name thats a big problem
8944274 they go to work for some cleaning company or something like that they have a complicated rota and they just dont get paid and the employer pays them a bit but not everything the employer then gets rid of them theyre 400 500 to the bad the tribunal claims are massively complicated therefore theres a limit to what we can do
8944275 the pay issue is one which applies particularly in the small industries again its the local food industry the migrant workers the agricultural workers and hairdressing is a particularly bad example there they pay on the national minimum wage and quite often below it i am constantly surprised at the number of times i have to make a national minimum wage application usually in conjunction with something else
8944276 i have for example a number of complaints from pubs where they employ cleaners and barmaids and barmen that they do not give any official letter to they dont give them hours of work they dont give them terms and conditions of employment
8944277 i have had it a few times recently where nurses and care workers have been brought over from various countries they need to be in employment for 12 months before they have any rights and during that 12 month period are being treated appallingly because if they complain about the treatment then they will lose their job and therefore their right to stay because theyre not going to work for 12 months so they tend to put up with a lot more than they should do they are trapped if they complain they are out and then they havent got the 12 months and they are out of the country it seems to happen a lot in the care home industry
8944278 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8944279 both authors have dealt in an authoritative way with the still rapidly expanding specialty and the eleventh edition of the book will be of the greatest value to all who are interested in the scientific and practical aspects of blood transfusion in clinical medicine
8944280 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8944281 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed
8944282 dishes heated by themselves or with food could keep the food hot of up to 15 minutes one might even cook a pizza on a plate and then deliver it hot
8944283 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8944284 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt
8944285 foolproof not to mention spill proof guide to manly success in the kitchen
8944286 our hope is that this work will provide new approaches for recovering function from the protein whose inability to fold and function properly compromises the quality of life and life expectancies of people with cf
8944287 since this pivotal discovery of the cf gene nearly 20 years ago researchers have made more progress toward a cure than they had in thousands of years before
8944288 people with cystic fibrosis now live longer than once ever thought possible and basic science breakthroughs like this one keep the trend ever upward
8944289 it is clear that there is a growing segment of the population that is considering a hybrid vehicle and travelers is committed to offering innovative products that meet the needs of todays market trends
8944290 in addition to saving at the pump illinois hybrid drivers can also save on their car insurance
8944291 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8944292 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8944293 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8944294 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8944295 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8944296 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8944297 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8944298 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
8944299 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8944300 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8944301 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
8944302 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
8944303 i am ninety or ninety three one or the other
8944304 i never liked jazz music because jazz music doesnt resolve i used to not like god because god didnt resolve but that was before any of this happened
8944305 the eyes of the world are on the chevy volt
8944306 there doesnt seem to be any obvious breakthrough in battery technology
8944307 they may be holding these results close to the vest
8944308 of course its realistic is it what gm is going to do not so sure
8944309 why did the ev 1 not use any gas but an electric car years later needs gas and gets less than half the range
8944310 the volt is not only a pr move but a fine balancing act of maintaining the political status quo with oil industries and pleasing the demand for green energy
8944311 the ev 1 could only go as far as the charge would take it 100 miles
8944312 the beauty of a hybrid is that for the 80 percent of americans that only drive 40 miles a day the volt would be fine
8944313 you have to be able to develop something that works then you have to be able to mass produce it
8944314 the vehicle is so new they wont make money on it
8944315 theres so much money put into r and d in the first place they want to get it out there to get some good press
8944316 the thing that gms not pointing out is how much power
8944317 these are the same arguments we heard with the ev 1
8944318 the same cannibalistic smears but this time to a smaller degree
8944319 history has a tendency to repeat itself thats why im cautious about the volt
8944320 when you introduce a radically different product you have to do it at the ideal time
8944321 now that gas prices are high people are going to look for alternatives
8944322 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8944323 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8944324 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8944325 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8944326 how to build a more just world and save the planet
8944327 this is a tool that will help them also be able to make better decisions so people arent evacuating when they shouldnt be
8944328 and i am going to know what is happening around me i will know where all the flooding is going on and be able to track out of here if i need to
8944329 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
8944330 when i first found out what a show runner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
8944331 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
8944332 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
8944333 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
8944334 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
8944335 there was nothing that had that beautiful romantic woody allen version of new york
8944336 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
8944337 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes
8944338 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved
8944339 do i wish we got better broadcast ratings yes i wish they gave us more money to make the show
8944340 for us its about how did you matter do people care and do they pay attention to what youre doing i think the show is really succeeding in terms of getting people excited and giving them something to talk about
8944341 before we shot anything she knew i didnt love the way dan looked on the page so she told me dont play to the words on the page
8944342 it was a huge confidence builder to stand in front of 34 21 year olds and explain something to them every day
8944343 to be in a room and have to explain your point of view is a huge skill in hollywood
8944344 its going to focus on putting people both friend wise and romance wise with people you wouldnt necessarily expect
8944345 watching these relationships develop will be very satisfying for the audience

8944355 he did say he has spoken to faldo has anyone else said that no
8944356 its nice to be told what to do by one so young and so inexperienced

8944363 obviously north carolina state is ten minutes away and john has already spent significant time on kentuckys and oklahoma states campuses
8944364 baylors situation in hiring dwon gives john a comfort level that doesnt exist anywhere else
8944365 but there are some schools that john is interested in because of style of play or the incoming recruiting class those factors and others might have as much to do with where john goes to school as anything
8944366 john doesnt owe anyone anything if he wants to go to baylor or if he wants to go to memphis he is going to do what he thinks is best for himself dwon did what was best for himself and that does have some impact on john because his comfort level is the most important factor but it doesnt obligate john to go to baylor

8944389 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8944390 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8944391 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level so were clearly better prepared
8944392 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right

8944396 distressing for the families involved which is why our government is taking action
8944397 while it will relieve pressure in icu we dont believe it will fix todays cardiac cancellation problems
8944398 its easy to get caught up in talk of an electric car revolution
8944399 however wed be very surprised if many of the all electric sports cars and other models that have been making headlines hit showrooms within forecast time frames
8944400 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
8944401 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving its far too early to know how all these effects together will influence insurance claim costs
8944402 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction

8944413 i firmly believe that i have picked the team that stands the best possible chance of getting us back into the world group in 2009
8944414 elevates the concern about risks of antipsychotics to a whole new level
8944415 new approach came out of the race fine but he was just too strong in the early part of the race
8944416 he was very fresh early and very rusty late and i said afterwards i needed to get him to settle again

8944418 the irish champion stakes is still very much the plan at this stage
8944419 i said some things for peter kenyon one month ago and they are trying to bring robinho here my job is on the pitch
8944420 if they bring him or not its for our board meetings i need to think about tottenham not if players come or not come

8944422 i want to stress it was 100 my decision to sell him
8944423 i wouldnt have sold him if i didnt believe at the end of the day we would move this club forward and thats what were going to do

8944482 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
8944483 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
8944484 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
8944485 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

8944517 well if its a core competency well integrate that and business amalysis into my own strategy group and learn where they fit
8944518 one of the first things that graham did with his new enterprise architects was to get them architecting enterprise as defined by economics rather than just capital he wanted them working on peoples ideas and motivations for creating maximum value from the capital we were investing in as well as helping to shape that capital
8944519 architecting enterprise as defined by economics rather than just capital
8944520 initially we set out to do an adventure activity show and the fact i was willing to do all these cool things that was the first idea
8944521 but then it kind of evolved into something slightly different because once we got to these places we realized these activities mean something really special in these cultures
8944522 theres not any additional financial assistance to help them survive and make it through their daily lives with their families

8944533 im sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment
8944534 there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
8944535 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
8944536 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
8944537 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 is the lowest in the sector

8944548 she is open minded kind but stern and a very hard worker she sometimes works at our facility seven days per week im sure she always works seven days per week because if she isnt physically in our facility she is thinking about it and how to improve it and resolve issues

8944571 im very disappointed with my executive producer skills when it comes to paying me as an actress
8944572 shouldnt become a producer if youre thinking about how you can come out on top
8944573 no one sitting up here was thinking theyd come out rich but we can all say weve done something were incredibly proud with which is something money cant buy

8944591 shes a new kid shes got energy and shes talking and wanting food and she smiles when she sees me its amazing
8944592 she could talk before but she didnt very often but shes talking a lot now and a lot more active
8944593 there is an enormous talent going to waste in our parliament
8944594 if he is going to stay it is the big job that he needs to do
8944595 everyone has realised that peter costello is by far and away the best performer in parliament and we are a better team with him
8944596 i am sure we will find an accomodation for brendan
8944597 if he changes his mind the situation would be different
8944598 the electorates feed back to me is that under peters stewardship australia and the economy did very well
8944599 costello has that credibility and hes got a lot to contribute
8944600 any question of leadership will be sorted out by the partyroom
8944601 i think his contribution would be priceless in the parliament
8944602 strongly in the interests of the liberal and national parties for peter to stay
8944603 he has amazing talents and a very important contribution to make
8944604 sen obama and sen mccain have been focusing on pocketbook issues like 4 gas global warming and security issues like energy independence now the auto industrys financial crisis has their attention
8944605 it may seem like the candidates positions are closely aligned but they actually have radically different approaches to cafe the vehicle technologies they champion and the support theyre willing to lend to automakers
8944606 plug ins are the holy grail for fuel economy because they can be driven extended distances on battery power alone and deliver in theory more than 100 miles per gallon
8944607 however major players in the industry disagree if plug ins are the answer theres also the question if 4 billion for r amp d and 7 000 incentives for consumers will be enough to perfect plug ins and other technologies put them into mass production and make the vehicles affordable for consumers on an accelerated timetable
8944608 promises made on the campaign trail have a way of moderating if the candidate gets elected but its clear that a president obama will use a carrot and stick approach to force the industry to become as green as possible and do it faster than they may be able to contain
8944609 while sen mccains endorsement of loan guarantees r amp d tax credits and consumer incentives show support for the industry his proposal to enforce cafe rather than increase it may be more important in the long run
8944610 the industry is making massive investments on borrowed money to meet the stringent fuel economy targets already on the books and they need to strive for a return on their capital increasing cafe would only increase the risks facing the industry
8944611 the cost of complying with todays fuel economy regulations alone will make cars more expensive to buy in coming years and the inflation in vehicle prices will likely outpace wage growth between now and 2014
8944612 consumers will respond by buying smaller vehicles keeping their cars and trucks longer and financing them for seven or eight years
8944613 these and other factors are going to keep industry volumes and profits under pressure
8944614 this reality may be what prompted sen mccain to reconsider loan guarantees for detroit and it may eventually lead sen obama to scale back his calls for a technology revolution or at least offer more assistance to achieve it
8944615 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8944616 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8944617 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8944618 overall the data still indicate that the pace of growth in consumer spending will fall back toward zero in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009
8944619 this was the first time worsening finances have been reported by the majority of consumers over a three month period in the long history of the surveys

8944621 should we pay any attention to celebrities like paris hilton
8944622 many of our major bank customers already lease with us
8944623 what we have that they dont is the back end capability to resell used equipment we can refurbish it and recycle it so this allows us to be aggressive with our leasing
8944624 we wanted to find a way to help banks get assets off their balance sheets
8944625 we will buy your existing equipment and get it off your books
8944626 this basically takes the equipment off the banks balance sheet and frees up cash its like outsourcing your equipment but you still own the people
8944627 this will be a trend as financial institutions look for liquidity
8944628 whether you lease or buy you still pay the whole bill in the end
8944629 does it allow for upgrades are you able to upgrade just parts of a piece of equipment do you have to upgrade to the existing vendors solutions only or can you go to a different vendor
8944630 they can end early you can opt to buy the equipment or not we try to facilitate the technology refresh and not hold the bank hostage with a financial instrument

8944634 its hard to believe mr mickel was supposedly in the running for the deputy premier spot when hes performed so badly as a minister

8944641 i look at the songs and im like how did i do that im a really lazy guy i dont know how i get this done id rather sit around and do nothing
8944642 its like whose songs are these i know i worked hard for them i know i put the time in but its still kind of a magical thing to have this block of work
8944643 i always wrote the best essay in the class so it was there from the start i was pretty good with words
8944644 when the beatles and the stones came along 62 63 it seemed fair game for any kid to become a songwriter
8944645 i think that a pop song or a rock n roll song is something designed to manipulate peoples emotions very very quickly
8944646 but with a song you know it pretty quickly you might need to hear it a few times before it digs in you try to get over various emotional ideas in a very short time and if theres a few intellectual ideas in there so be it very good as well
8944647 the richard dawkins book the god delusion came out and was quite critical of religion shall we say the christopher hitchens book god is not great and the sam harris book the end of faith and i just kind of felt those books put into brilliant context how i feel sometimes people can do that for you thats what art is about
8944648 stick to the plan is another with a few political undertones here and there but again its playful im usually being playful with this stuff occasionally bile will creep in but thats more from the past
8944649 its hard to define what makes squeezing out sparks click really i just wrote a bunch of songs that worked together that were quite powerful i think
8944650 squeezing out sparks broke the mold of what was being developed these long recording processes where you try to make everything perfect which is ridiculous really and sparks didnt do that at all we did it in 11 days
8944651 i feel a great deal of empathy for the people who are looking for work right now

8944657 the temporary impact of the stimulus has passed and it looks like consumer spending is on track to decline in real terms in the third quarter
8944658 its certainly a wake up call to people who yesterday looked at the gdp report and said hey the economy grew by 3
8944659 some of the run up is bleeding into or being passed through other nonfood and energy prices like air fares
8944660 everybody no matter what business youre in has energy costs to produce products and energy costs to transport products
8944661 wow you guys are amazingly beautiful whats the story two girls in a bar and no guys around them whats the deal
8944662 the divorce rate has dropped the birth rate is on the increase and so is the number of marriages and the length of marriage
8944663 it seems that australians are in a happier space relationship wise than weve been in for quite some time
8944664 i think that it reflects the general prosperity of the era
8944665 the rise in the median age at divorce may be attributed to the increasing age at marriage the increase in the interval between marriage and divorce and reflective of the overall ageing of the australian population
8944666 the people at the coal face of divorce are typically aged in their 30s
8944667 these are people that have delayed commitment to marriage doing so in their late 20s instead of the early 20s like the baby boomers which means that they have probably invested more time in considering their partner options
8944668 if you commit to marriage at 21 then things are more likely to go wrong if you are 30 then theoretically you are more mature and you know what you are doing
8944669 this shows more of a collaborative approach if you are older and more mature you will navigate a path forward
8944670 both our parents have been married more than 30 years so we come from a background where you believe that when you say i do it is for life
8944671 i dont find it hard theres definitely challenges and we just make compromises for each other
8944672 i will stand down as treasurer before the mini budget in november if there is not the will to address this
8944673 there is no point being treasurer if people arent prepared to make difficult decisions on public sector reforms
8944674 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget does not return the aaa credit rating to a sustainable path
8944675 ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw to return it to a sustainable path the world has changed we do not have the luxury of waiting to reform
8944676 this mini budget will require hard decisions to do that its crunch time
8944677 because of ofarrell public sector reform is no longer a luxury we cant afford to wait
8944678 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
8944679 i regard the power reforms as necessary but as a legacy reform issue the real reform is adjusting our revenues and expenditure
8944680 there is no other way to get the state into a sustainable position

8944709 weve appointed charlie duncan to be interim head coach until the situation is resolved
8944710 practice is going on as scheduled and we are preparing for friday night
8944711 we addressed the team and told them there were some issues going on
8944712 we told them we had to keep focused and theyve done that pretty well they feel for the situation and they are worried about their coach but we have business ahead of us
8944713 weve pulled tighter together and we know that with the loss of our quarterback and being without our head coach right now we have to pull together and help each other out i think weve done that well
8944714 right now the investigation is being conducted by the knox county sheriffs office pending the outcome of the investigation the district will act accordingly
8944715 if we put too much water in there we could blow the bottom out
8944716 if we dont follow the right procedures we could have an explosion
8944717 were trying to get someone from the department of agriculture whos more experienced and knowledgeable about this type of thing
8944718 what we do is probably no different than what other schools do
8944719 we just have a talented staff with a variety of experiences they work well with kids and they work well together everyone comes together to make sure we reach every child because if students have someone to relate to they do better academically
8944720 we do try to keep it in perspective though its just one test a student might do better than expected on that particular test day and another may not do as well as expected
8944721 we use the information to decide how to do the best for our children while at the same time trying to meet the states expectations
8944722 we are pleased with the results our being pleased though is also tempered with thinking where do we go from here and what will next years report card look like i think there are a lot of things to celebrate and i think there are also some things we need to work on
8944723 is it makes us really take a look and reflect on what we do it makes you reflect on what youre teaching and how youre teaching were more focused now on every kid every kid counts and thats the way it should be
8944724 we want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help them become proficient in everything before they get to the middle school
8944725 now the emphasis is on the whole child each and every child
8944726 value added is going to make us look more closely at what we do how we present material and differentiate instruction
8944727 and this standard is a snapshot of a day this grade card is a snapshot of a week its a snapshot of what took place on that test day at that moment and there are so many variables that go into that snapshot of a day our principals got preliminary data in june and they were working on these things already before they left at the end of june looking at what the scores were looking at what they missed looking at what they need to do teachers were also reviewing the information
8944728 the elementary sets the foundation when you build anything you want a strong solid foundation at the elementary level we have been implementing literacy collaborative and will expand it to grades three four and five we hope that as we provide that foundation we are going to see success and were going to see continued improvement in our reading scores so much of the test is reading and understanding you look at the math and it is all story problems so you have to go though the reading process with math and social studies and science as well as reading that foundation carries over into the middle school and i hope to see our high school benefiting from improvement at the middle school its a total team concept

8944733 clinton era m s conocida entre la comunidad latina que obama y era de esperarse este apoyo a la ex primera dama sin embargo obama ya se ha dado a conocer y cuenta con el respaldo de la senadora y de los latinos dem cratas
8944734 los votantes perciben que hillary y obama ya han pasado sus diferencias y han decidido que lo m s importante es recuperar no s lo el voto latino sino el de todo el mundo
8944735 un puesto le espera en alg n lugar de la nueva presidencia si es elegido obama
8944736 me parece que un gran n mero de nuestra comunidad optar por el voto dem crata
8944737 obama apoya m s el tipo de pol ticas que la comunidad latina necesita para progresar social y pol ticamente
8944738 como comunidad y como ciudadanos podemos hacer una gran diferencia en las pr ximas elecciones
8944739 meine g ste kommen zu mir um in gem tlicher atmosph re eine wasserpfeife rauchen zu k nnen
8944740 die entscheidung des verfassungsgerichts hat deutlich gezeigt dass die frage des rauchverbots politisch und nicht juristisch gel st werden muss wir wollen einen effektiven nichtraucherschutz der gleichzeitig den wirten und b rgern eine wahl l sst
8944741 any area employers that have their headquarters here and branches in other areas of the state couldnt use florida health care plans because we didnt have a strong network of out of area providers
8944742 this purchase brings more choice to the people of flagler and volusia counties
8944743 it will strengthen florida health care plans it adds to bluecross blueshield i think its going to be good for all constituencies
8944744 you wont see anything different tomorrow than you do today
8944745 the relationship we have with halifax is an extremely strong relationship among the strongest in the state
8944746 id say of all insurance plans in the area bluecross is probably the easiest
8944747 the reality is i dont know that you replace either one of those guys
8944748 we think certainly we have some really really good quarterbacks and they are going to need some help from the people around them
8944749 i havent seen all the offensive lines in the pac 10 but i would think this rates toward the top
8944750 they have been together very quick a smaller line than weve seen in practice so it will be a little bit of a tempo thing when they see this group
8944751 theres a lot of got to find the ball against these guys
8944752 thats not hype thats a pretty good test for us early but were just going to have to find out where we stand obviously if we can have success against them then we are pretty good
8944753 szerintem 20 futam a hat r felt ve persze hogy a tesztek sz ma jelent sen cs kken 20 verseny a v gs hat r
8944754 today were being influenced primarily because oil is up 2 ahead of a long weekend investors are very nervous
8944755 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter and there will be some non linearity in the improvements in our operating income margins as we rebalance our portfolio make cost improvements and drive growth
8944756 phishing was coined by hackers who used this method for illicit purposes to the order of luring people to get their bank passwords credit card number etc
8944757 personally i think we engage in too many court battles with companies about issues that would be better resolved if we sat down at the table with the company and talked about how to do things better
8944758 my style is to sit down and look across the table at somebody rather than to file the papers to see them in court
8944759 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8944760 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between and man and a woman i am opposed to any expansion of gambling in alaska
8944761 may be the biggest single year line item veto total in state history
8944762 why are people so flawed we all are in different degrees
8944763 either brings you to tears or sends chills down your spine its a moment when you can see yourself
8944764 its a japanese film that is also an american thriller
8944765 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8944766 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8944767 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8944768 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8944769 barack obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
8944770 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
8944771 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8944772 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8944773 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8944774 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8944775 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8944776 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8944777 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8944778 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8944779 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8944780 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8944781 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8944782 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8944783 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8944784 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8944785 wouldnt it be so cool if mom and dad this or maybe nick and starr when were older
8944786 applications are due for the amazing race on monday i bought a plane ticket and ill be in denver on friday so we can flm a video together lets do it
8944787 wait what im opening a show tuesday night how can you expect me to do that
8944788 oh my god im so jealous ive always wanted to do that
8944789 itll be so fun to know somebody on the show
8944790 please dont let me be eliminated first please dont let me be eliminated first
8944791 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8944792 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8944793 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8944794 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
8944795 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
8944796 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
8944797 yes i blog under my name boring right but this is who i am i dont blog under a handler i dont do that im pam
8944798 i like what youre saying but i really dont think that we have the time to do all of that
8944799 you can be a victim once and then youre a volunteer
8944800 but his life and his moral character didn t lead him down that path
8944801 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8944802 gay activists and their allies have made no secret of their strategy to convince bible believing christians and jews that homosexual behavior is no longer sinful in gods eyes
8944803 this false doctrine is playing out in denomination after denomination with increasing discord
8944804 christians are not called to rewrite the bible in order to love our gay friends and neighbors true love does not sacrifice the truth
8944805 an unconditional welcome to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities
8944806 increase the number of people of faith supporting equality for lgbt people
8944807 the more than 2 5 million individuals in the 3 100 congregations supported by the institute for welcoming resources and these partner organizations are some of our movements most valuable advocates in promoting understanding reclaiming what unfortunately has become a narrow view of moral values espoused by those who seek to divide and advancing lgbt equality
8944808 our biblically based opposition to the normalization of homosexuality and the affirmation of homosexual behavior should not hinder us from ministering to homosexuals and offering them the love and healing environment they need to leave this destructive and unbiblical lifestyle
8944809 whenever you have an efficient government you have a dictatorship
8944810 i imagine that light to medium complexions will be able to wear both palettes with ease
8944811 the gist of this palette is it allows you to go from daytime to nighttime make up with one handy dandy palette clearly that feat will be easy to attain
8944812 the colors are always beautifully coordinated the textures of the powders are amazing and the price tags dont make your heart stop the multi platinum palette is no exception to the high standards ive come to expect and in fact it ups the ante significantly like all lorac palettes the texture of these powders is sublime super soft pigmented and easily blended out theyre a dream to work with even something as notoriously temperamental as a glittery black
8944813 the smokey eyes i create with these eyeshadows are the best i have every seen the shadows go on so smoothly that it feels and looks like i am applying a cream shadow the color and intensity last all day it offers the perfect amount of shimmer without looking like you spilled a container of glitter on yourself
8944814 tartes lock amp roll was love at first sight i fell hard for the gunmetal shade gunmetal is the perfect blend of gray lavender and silver in a word gorgeous
8944815 as far i know shawn michaels will still be at our next pay per view unforgiven wrestling chris jericho in an unsactioned match
8944816 he has a compelling story that appeals to the gops evangelical base hes got great mic skills and he brings youthful energy to a ticket democrats are going to hear sweet chin music come november
8944817 while its a dramatic and interesting it would make the argument mccains making now difficult to justify
8944818 besides a lot of people still blame him for forcing
8944819 we need to rebuild our relationship with our traditional allies michaels is already despised in canada whats the rest of the world going to think of him
8944820 a party animal who found god and lives in texas in the white house sound familiar weve already had eight years of george w bush we dont need four more years
8944821 i cant support the green party because the green party is pacifist
8944822 a person who loves supports and defends his or her country sometimes excessively
8944823 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
8944824 if you have a green party i want to join
8944825 enset is the last food asset for most families in this region
8944826 seeing it in the market in such quantities means there is no other food to eat
8944827 i expect to harvest food that can last me at least six months
8944828 once the food gets finished i will sell firewood or work for someone to feed the children
8944829 the big question is whether we have enough in our own economy to be able to finance it
8944830 when you get people living on the edge a shock like drought easily pushes them over
8944831 then it brings them into the cycle of not being able to pull themselves out of it
8944832 over the past two months the situation has worsened and living conditions have deteriorated people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves
8944833 we have pockets of severe malnutrition in some districts in the south and an emergency situation in the somali region
8944834 its not small to those who are suffering but it is a manageable problem
8944835 famine has wreaked havoc in ethiopia for so long it would be stupid not to be sensitive to the risk of such things occurring but there has not been a famine on our watch emergencies but no famines
8944836 we are seeing phase one we are yet to see phase two
8944837 it is normal to have small areas of malnutrition during the hunger season when people wait for the harvest
8944838 this year it is more widespread mainly because of failed rains
8944839 comparison between the sources of food in a normal year and the past four weeks indicated a dramatic shift from own production to purchased food and other sources
8944840 the government delayed then under described the problem still it does not compare with 1984
8944841 the main problems are inadequate rains and too many people
8944842 the population has doubled in the last 22 years from 41 to almost 80 million peoples coping mechanisms have been eroded and many have got used to handouts over the years
8944843 every year madagascar imports about 200 000 tonnes of rice for consumption this year the gap is estimated at 270 000 tonnes and that will present a challenge
8944844 importing rice at international prices means paying 70 percent more than current local prices and that isnt expected to change
8944845 madagascar stands to benefit as a major exporter to the indian ocean islands of comoros seychelles and mauritius for example countries in eastern and southern africa could be another major export market
8944846 malnourishment in madagascar is aggravated by peoples dependence on just one food rice which provides calories but not many nutrients or protein
8944847 this is the first significant sorghum harvest the south has had in nearly 20 years
8944848 sorghum disappeared as a main food crop in the mid 1990s when both crops and seeds were consumed in famine years for survival quality sorghum seed was no longer available in southern madagascar and then sorghum was largely replaced by maize
8944849 i asked god for a quarter and a quarter is what i got what i didnt know was i could have asked for a 1 00 and he would have given it to me instead
8944850 with which candidate will you have a more healthy long term relationship with which candidate can you be confident about an equal exchange of the five characteristics found in healthy relationships and with which candidate can you permanently affix their bumper sticker to your car without fear of having to remove it under the cover of darkness if they fail to meet or exceed your expectations
8944851 women who go through menopause naturally may continue to produce some hormones that are beneficial for sexual response whereas women whose ovaries are removed are not producing these reproductive hormones
8944852 in addition naturally menopausal women have more time to adjust physically to the hormonal changes and may also be expecting changes in their sexual response that reduces their distress about their low sexual desire
8944853 i think we got embarrassed last year by washington oregon defensive end nick reed said
8944854 and all of us want to work to rectify that
8944855 i dont think they necessarily needed to happen oregon coach mike bellotti said
8944856 hes probably the most dangerous weapon in d 1 football said bellotti who recruited locker
8944857 im sure this year theyre going to put some things around him plays and schemes to highlight that ability
8944858 hes faster than you think hes stronger than you think bellotti said
8944859 i think this year he will be much more accurate and improve his efficiency rating as a quarterback
8944860 sometimes its a good position not to know willingham said
8944861 i think that confidence and attitude will make the difference locker said
8944862 were good enough to be here we shouldnt be surprised to be here
8944863 its a good and a bad thing reed said of his units troubles last october
8944864 its bad that it happened to us last year but it definitely gives us something to work for
8944865 theres only one room that has any flooring still intact it is completely burnt out
8944866 he opened the door and confronted fire and plumes of smoke
8944867 they were very very lucky another few minutes and it could have been a whole different story
8944868 its huge the growth and its mainly because people are doing the maths themselves
8944869 one of the things we think people are cutting out is that massive petrol cost and that has translated to very busy trains
8944870 you cant get your car back from ballarat to melbourne for 40 on a family ticket
8944871 we will also be using those figures to show they can travel quite cheaply to the country and hopefully spend their money in town we do have capacity in the off peak trains and we want to fill them
8944872 the bureau of managed health care staff described frequent marketing violations some of which have risen to the level of possible fraud
8944873 most states do not allow direct marketing youre severely limited in how you can approach
8944874 if the minister chooses to not meaningfully respond ballarat medical staff today resolve to reconvene in october to consider potential action in support of a sustainable victorian rural public health system
8944875 i am seriously considering working interstate in 2009 which is sad because i went to medical school and did my early training in victoria so i know the system well
8944876 without significant public hospital reform victoria risks losing the best and brightest doctors to the private sector for better conditions or interstate for more attractive salaries
8944877 there was damage to the prime mover and slight damage to the trailer but the most important thing was that the driver wasnt hurt
8944878 young people have expressed interest in an event that will give them information and links to services and clubs
8944879 by council being on the front foot we can welcome and embrace these new young professionals to ballarat and help to keep them in ballarat
8944880 the government is not going to promote the hijacking of democracy through their government contracting process
8944881 and it might be fun to see what stage in labor rhetoric comes after apoplectic
8944882 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8944883 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8944884 with waters coming up it gives them more room to get in trouble
8944885 and they can float for a good day or two until they grip on to something or get onto dry land
8944886 you can actually see the fire ants floating in a mass
8944887 rising waters can force any pests out of the ground
8944888 and anything down in the dirt can get out of the water and into homes
8944889 right now the mosquito population is nothing compared to what were going to have in a week or so
8944890 we try to be good but these things can get around you pretty quick
8944891 respeto mucho a estos dos luchadores sociales y conf o en que cumplir n una buena gesti n

8944898 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8944899 all mississippians to please take this storm seriously one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8944900 there will be a woman on the ticket and it isnt hillary
8944901 feminist for life she is the mother of five her youngest child born in april has downs syndrome
8944902 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart
8944903 hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8944904 but if folks are looking for electricity to run hair dryers televisions etc then no we make no attempt to provide for such high energy usage
8944905 cant imagine why anyone would want to be on a computer when they can be outside with the bison and wildlife
8944906 i am deeply convinced that this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8944907 bbc correspondent mark mardell happily explores the eu s common agriculture policy in a great blog post
8944908 the main story was a polish decision to block an eu day against the death penalty mark mardell has more on this
8944909 journalist blogs about eu matters have been springing up increasingly mark mardells is the best of the bunch
8944910 mark mardell is quietly shaping up to become one of the beeb s most impressive bloggers
8944911 the accused in case it 95 05 18 walked into the otherwise empty court room flanked by two guards upright and

8944914 this play was originally proposed by ben and ashley pryor we read it out loud and unanimously felt that it was a great choice for the company
8944915 obviously when we are choosing there are several things we look at the first being can we produce and cast this play we are also interested in seeing whether the play is artistically valuable for the community in which we live we felt that this play really raises questions that are essential to every single person
8944916 eurydice is written in a non realistic way it is a symphony rather than a play and is written in movements rather than acts the language is poetic and stylized
8944917 the most difficult challenge has been to create a world that suits the writing the acting staging and design do not suit a realistic framework so an alternative metaphorical style needs to be used one that will stimulate the audiences imagination and carry them through the underworld with eurydice
8944918 people think filmmaking is glamorous but really its grunt work less is best
8944919 our first three short films were all kind of quasi dramas
8944920 when we were doing dr shock i was doing makeup effects for other features in the area
8944921 we became no 1 in horror and the most reviewed
8944922 last count we were being distributed in three continents asia europe and north america of course weve been in best buy and target i hear were big in pittsburgh too
8944923 were both start high school grads we love toledo for a lot of reasons ten minutes youre in norman rockwell country someone thought we shot in texas toledo can look like anything its a great backdrop
8944924 all one has to do is walk along and raise their eyes they will see what we are talking about
8944925 the city of toledo understands the economy presents a challenge in light of that it is interesting to note that numerous businesses have expanded in the warehouse district
8944926 within the last two years several new or expanding businesses have moved into the warehouse district area
8944927 with the continued success of fifth third field as well as the construction of the new arena the city of toledo believes the trend for the warehouse district will continue to be positive
8944928 beyond three days forecasts for wind speed are very poor they have no skill
8944929 its not certain by any means that gustav is going to come ashore in the u s as a major hurricane
8944930 in conducting my research for this report i was forced to draw the same conclusion when the reaction from the police bureau management to my inquiries and observations was defensive and in some cases obstructive
8944931 police bureau managers too often treat recommendations and suggestions from city staff community members and their own officers with
8944932 we could not do this performance anywhere else it could not be put on a stage it could not even go into another city that has a similar venue of a reflecting pool
8944933 the dances are created to take place on the granite walkways and into the water with what i like to call choreographed splashing
8944934 it incorporates different styles of dance it incorporates modern ballet jazz and it really maybe falls more along the lines of a lyrical type of performance
8944935 we cant do things like turns and that kind of stuff its a very strenuous environment to dance in so the performances are short but theyre very intense
8944936 having the space used again the way it was i think initially planned to be used
8944937 he asked me a very important question he said what would it take to bring other artists downtown from that conversation the artists on the river festival developed but it was really kind of all around the desire to do the performance in the pond again
8944938 wir konnten rund 20 000 euro einnehmen so macht das spa

8944970 the dangers of renewed violent conflict and humanitarian crisis in kordofan have been evident ever since the signing of the cpa
8944971 rather than socio economic integration and political reconciliation lubricated by a development efforts and a peace dividend south kordofan is the locus of an armed standoff with many fearing a return to war
8944972 the potential for armed group activity is fuelled by the large numbers of ex combatants the near absence of a comprehensive reintegration programme since organised hostilities ended in 2005
8944973 without the required co location in training centres the former enemies have separate chains of command training armaments and barracks administration of government and splm controlled areas remains separate two local government systems currently operate in parallel with separate policies for education two languages two systems judicial and security systems and local government structures passing from one area to the other involves passing through armed checkpoints
8944974 if you look at the new developments in the area there is a very big gap between what the report is saying and what is also taking place
8944975 i dont think the reports findings have become invalid but there has been a very big breakthrough in terms of integration of separate administrations and police forces
8944976 i would be the last person to say there are no problems in south kordofan that would be nonsense
8944977 but i think this is a huge step forward and i am amazed that there is hardly any attention for this fact i dont think war will be as inevitable as people have been saying
8944978 unmis has done little to calm tensions in contrast to the active efforts of the much smaller number of unarmed ceasefire monitors the joint military commission jmc which were present from 2002 05 military observers in the un mission in sudan unmis peacekeeping force are insufficiently resourced and supported there are no permanent un civil affairs and human rights officers and international ngos and other independent observers are few
8944979 i dont think that unmis has been weak or has failed in implementing its part of ddr
8944980 there are a lot of preparatory things we had to have in place before we could start
8944981 it would have been a disaster all these prerequisites have now been met and that is why we are moving towards a pilot project

8945054 i know the field goal percentage record is 95 something but i dont look at it as being a huge thing
8945055 i want to get a championship ring and play in a bowl game thats my goal
8945056 my mom called me a couple of weeks ago and said she saw the groza watch list on the internet and that i was on it
8945057 im just here to kick whatever happens happens i didnt have a lot of real far field goals a lot of them were short maybe thats why im not on the list
8945058 i show in pregame practice that i can kick the long ones and make them ive only missed one field goal so hes got to have faith in me but thats his mentality and i never go against the coach i never question the way coaches coach at times it bothers me but you cant hold a grudge
8945059 fifty five yards might be pushing it i hit a 58 yarder in pregame practice at kansas last year
8945060 its good to be left on your own during practice it makes you better the fewer people around you the better

8945067 the scholarship is for college students who are members of the church and enrolled in school full time
8945068 i noticed that young men not just at our church but young men everywhere were not graduating from high school like the young ladies i heard a voice from god and talked to my husband about it and we decided to create the scholarship
8945069 it was very special to me because i wasnt sure i was going to school
8945070 it has helped me pay for books my cell phone bill and as an interior design student i have a lot of extra fees so it has helped pay for fabric sewing equipment and art supplies

8945096 from this year we are hoping to take charge of four main programmes which earlier have been handled by directorate of film festivals
8945097 we are expecting 40 50 percent of charge of the festival and are asking for the competition section cinema of the world special section and registration on datacal system we have already received approval for the indian premier section and the for the short film centre
8945098 goa has all the facilities and infrastructure and has the capacity to hold a bigger festival than iffi
8945099 it will first in time in india and is brainchild of esg a business platform for documentary filmmakers to project their films which are below 30 minutes duration and are planning to have 500 documentary films for this section
8945100 it is to bridge gap among them around 5 000 documentary films are produced in india and in goa too the approximate figure is 50 100 but they are not marketed properly and hence this scheme will help help filmmakers to showcase their movies and an opportunity too to sell their films
8945101 we had a meeting with the line producers of goa and came up to a decision of raising the fee from 6 000 to 10 000 per day out of this will be paid to the respective village panchayat and confirmed that local film producers are exempted from the charges
8945102 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
8945103 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8945104 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight

8945117 the chief minister is already publicly censured it is a big punishment for a communist leader and a communist so it is enough a person cannot get any punishment twice for the same crime for the party it is over the chapter is closed
8945118 the official chinese position if it were pushed would be that this is unacceptable
8945119 china doesnt want to give the green light to somebody coming to the side of separatist forces within their troubled regions
8945120 china will not abstain china is not going to go for something overturning a sovereign government and a sovereign rule
8945121 its just not going to happen as chinas position on taiwan would go down the drain
8945122 if the resolution is focused on the question of sovereignty china may very well side with the west
8945123 but china will do its upmost to avoid such a resolution being presented to the security council because it doesnt want to damage its relationship with russia
8945124 it is always possible that the western countries will force a vote and if it happens i think china will abstain
8945125 thats not in chinas interest as it has in the past managed to get some influence in central asia and china and russia both cooperate and compete in the region for influence
8945126 but if russia overplays its hand they will side with the us
8945127 anybody in the army can take advantage of the program
8945128 through the aeop its very easy to start a gems program at your installation
8945129 we had 21 students but facilities in different areas can have as many as 100 kids
8945130 we have a design laboratory at wsmr where we build circuit boards so we provided kits that allowed kids to build circuit boards to create various things including a lie detector and a tone generator
8945131 arl has a history of outreach to the local communities to get students involved in science and math with hopes that by exposing them to science and engineering at an early age theyll pursue careers in those fields
8945132 what we are trying to do is identify force generation needs we are looking at the way ahead
8945133 we already know where we are going to be in six months we are looking two years plus trying to figure out what we see the ia looking like what challenges we are going to encounter in getting to that end
8945134 the ia has made enormous strides at this point in time
8945135 comparing them now to when i was back here for operation iraqi freedom i and oif ii you cant do it
8945136 they know how to clear rooms they know how to conduct a cordon and search they do that all the time and they are doing that on their own like in recent operations in amarah they are conducting major combat operations like up in diyalah right now with minimal coalition support
8945137 as the iraqis get increasingly better at controlling their battle space we are shifting less from advising on operations and intelligence and fires where they are not only competent but they are four or five times better than the bad guys and we are helping them more on logistics
8945138 the united states and coalition will not build barracks for the iraqi military any more its up to the iraqi military to do this there is enough money there is a plan and we need to make a decision to execute the plan
8945139 they can actually fall in on our old outposts and have a fully functional outpost thats what shrink and share means
8945140 the goal is for them to increase their security capability and for us to decrease our presence
8945141 under our lessons learned weve changed our plans and have now located more soldiers in coastal areas so they are already in place should they be needed
8945142 were planning and supporting for the worst but hoping for the best

8945147 he didnt say anything about it but we kind of knew
8945148 some hard coaching was going on a little more coaching than normal in the last preseason game so we kind of knew what the deal was
8945149 but we wanted him coming back to get a win for him
8945150 i would love to have had them play the whole game
8945151 and just grind it out and work and get into some rhythm things like that but that would not have been smart
8945152 everybody is excited the guys were talking about it on the sideline its time to stop just practicing and playing for fun and start playing for real

8945156 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
8945157 a surprise last minute dark horse for the selection it now looks as though she indeed may be the pick no confirmation
8945158 it sure looks like it it sure smells like it
8945159 it turned out palin caught the temper of the times perfectly
8945160 in 2006 he had 130 plus bushel soybeans followed in 2007 with a yield of over 154 bushels
8945161 one thing that kips does to start fields off right is to use a foundation of residual herbicides
8945162 this year across much of the midwest there was much rain even down here in southwest missouri kip said he had something like 52 inches of rain
8945163 that provides time to come back with a post emergence with an in crop application
8945164 we need to get every bushel we can off a field
8945165 one of the other things kips been doing is implementing an insecticide in with a fungicide treatment hes been using respect a very broad spectrum insecticide from basf active on key pests its easy to mix and highly compatible with all the different tank mixes we might need to use he uses that on all his corn and soybeans as well
8945166 headline helps protect yields and maximize yield potential by controlling diseases and minimizing crop stress headline controls all key soybean diseases anthracnose septoria asr brownspot it does that by controlling those diseases but also reducing stress in the crop
8945167 its on the market today we have over 2 500 on farm trials on average in those trials headline has outyielded untreated areas by 4 to 8 bushels across the midwest and south
8945168 another way to think about it is in kips terminology a healthy plant is a happy plant one that wants to make yield
8945169 kip typically puts it out with a headline application at around r 3 soybeans that takes care of any bugs on the leaves and pods and the headline extends control of diseases and minimizes crop stress
8945170 extreme is very flexible in indiana we use it predominately as a burndown product it differs around the country a lot of people use it in a burndown program and others use it in crops
8945171 our focus will be on addressing the unprecedented change under way in agriculture record commodity prices large increases in land values and dramatic shifts in land ownership are affecting us all in many ways
8945172 in addition to valuable information on timely topics this will be an excellent opportunity to network with top agribusiness professionals from across the country
8945173 growers are trying to get crops cut as quickly as they can even if gustav doesnt hit louisiana directly it could still exacerbate current or looming problems
8945174 one was in iberia parish on the coast at a site that had rust for the past two seasons wed been surprised it hadnt shown up there yet this year but finally it has
8945175 she found some rust in kudzu in baton rouge along some railroad tracks
8945176 theres been no widespread finding of rust however the weather conditions over the last month rains from hurricane fay and afternoon showers regularly have added to worries about rust picking up well keep farmers fully informed about any new threats that pop up
8945177 rust is in florida georgia south alabama louisiana and texas
8945178 based on current weather conditions well be seeing it pick up here in mississippi but by then the bulk of our soybeans will be out of danger
8945179 walked through some jackson county hot spots four abreast it just so happened after wed looked and looked that malcolm broome a retired researcher with mississippi extension pulled a leaf and said hey this is rust
8945180 but that was it we searched all over and couldnt find more it was the luckiest thing im sure theres more rust than that there but its very rare
8945181 theres a kudzu patch there that was heavily infected with rust last year tom allen plant pathologist stationed at the delta branch station in stoneville miss found a few pustules on one leaf and that was it
8945182 so these latest finds are at extremely low levels of inoculum were really not concerned about whats coming out of mississippis infected sites and weve not changed our recommendations a fungicide is not warranted yet
8945183 temperatures have cooled and theres plenty of moisture im more concerned about what might be coming out of florida where rust has been reproducing rapidly over the past week or so fay could easily have moved rust spores into the southeast and mid south
8945184 but even with that situation most of the soybeans in mississippi are close to being out of vulnerable stages that doesnt include 500 000 acres of wheat beans in the state of course if rust does hit some of those beans could be hurt
8945185 of course thats based on current and expected weather conditions and those could change another thing to consider is the inoculum levels in neighboring states is low
8945186 extreme eastern arkansas was touched by a couple of bands off fay those could have brought rust spores were keeping up with monitoring efforts and if anyone finds something suspicious please let us know
8945187 frogeye cercospora leaf blight and aerial blight are hitting some areas interestingly one of the biggest problems showing up in soybeans is nematodes a lot of that is attributable to acres moving from cotton to soybeans lots of that former cotton ground has serious issues with rootknot nematodes and now those have shown up in soybeans
8945188 a range of things we have soybeans that were planted in late march april and may those are maturing and in some areas farmers have been able to dodge rains and cut them
8945189 however we also have a lot of full season soybeans that were planted later say in late may and june along with double cropped beans behind wheat those are the beans to be concerned about we have beans from late vegetative stages all the way to full maturity
8945190 corn is showing typical stalk rot wet rot issues with fusarium and whatnot especially in pockets in the south further north were finding a lot of charcoal rot it was dry in some of those ridge soils for a long time and some of the corn was either dryland or irrigation was a little late once the infection process begins adding irrigation water doesnt really inhibit the charcoal rot infection process itll continue to develop
8945191 i just talked to a northeast louisiana consultant who said he was seeing that in his area
8945192 in general than about rust the soybeans have had a lot of moisture in the last few days and gustav could bring even more
8945193 there were safety issues and the laws there for a reason otherwise every tom dick or harry could turn up and take people out
8945194 in an area like torbay where youve got existing operators who have paid out for licences it doesnt take long before resentment builds up if someone is not following the rules
8945195 i sat back down to eat with my knife and fork in my hand
8945196 she grabbed the food on my plate i stood up and lashed out with my hand
8945197 i forgot i had the knife in my hand at the time and so i stabbed her through the chest i didnt mean to stab her im very sorry
8945198 es una acci n preconcebida emprendida para justificar las acciones agresivas contra georgia
8945199 i appreciate the work iri is doing to advance the cause of liberty for more than two decades iri has been at the forefront of democratic change in more than a hundred countries youve trained the next generation of leaders youve strengthened political parties youve monitored elections and youre helping to build civil societies
8945200 if the middle east remains a place where freedom does not flourish it will remain a place of stagnation and resentment and violence ready for export the united states has adopted a new policy a forward strategy of freedom in the middle east a strategy that recognizes the best way to defeat the ideology that uses terror as a weapon is to spread freedom and democracy
8945201 tonight i am on the same platform as anwar ibrahim the best part of being in my line of work is the people you get to meet the heroes of our time anwar ibrahim is a hero of our time
8945202 i know of organizations being harassed and people are worried that they are identified as a threat simply because of their religious beliefs or cultural background the government can work to moderate and build trust with the people i have cited organizations such as usaid the national endowment for democracy the international republican institute the national democratic institute the peace corps and various other think tanks that take the more liberal open view without compromising the fundamentals you see there is always this difficulty that one small incident will dismantle the entire fabric of our agreement and this is really difficult for us to accept
8945203 iraq in the next few months could be the same as somalia if its mismanaged
8945204 we all want the war to end we just want to win it that to me is non negotiable
8945205 weve accomplished too much weve sacrificed too much to just pull out weve got to go over the finish line in the end weve got to accomplish mission success
8945206 thats my greatest fear today we have been doing so well for so long that we are going to get a little complacent
8945207 one way to build those kinds of relationships is to put people in groups in adverse situations
8945208 we didnt have to talk we were operating as one we were the essence of a team of a well oiled machine
8945209 when you are facing a difficult task you dont want to be trying to figure out how to work together you need to go into a difficult task knowing the team and how it works
8945210 leaders have to understand all the success of a mission or an organization is their responsibility
8945211 the point of the spear leadership is responsible and employees are all an integral part of supporting the capability at the point of the spear
8945212 what were the leaders doing that day what decisions were being made and what aspects did those decisions affect
8945213 the resource piece of the puzzle was really the achilles heel of the whole operation
8945214 the place was a mess with civil war drought natural disasters we thought we would intervene by providing food and aid through relief agencies
8945215 but food and aid wasnt getting to the people so we sent in soldiers we opened supply lines and occupied the terrain and didnt fire a single shot it was an overwhelming success unfortunately the mission began to change
8945216 we knew where he was so the mission was relatively straightforward as long as we had access to the terrain we had a 95 percent chance of success
8945217 but aidid was given three months to go underground tensions were building and our forces were drawn down from 28 000 to 1 500 we were a skeleton of our former self and the u s took out all its armor in spite of the fact the mission was becoming more difficult and complex and the people we were up against were starting to understand us better the playing field tends to level with understanding
8945218 leaders make decisions based on the facts they get from their staff
8945219 but what happens when those facts are wrong then you are going to make wrong decisions
8945220 when the first black hawk was shot down we had a commander in the field with a crisis and with no resources to be successful
8945221 we had two options to abandon him or send in another helicopter
8945222 i have to thank redstone arsenal because of all the technology theyve gotten into the platform to save lives theres a lot of redundancy built in the platforms for that purpose
8945223 that technology and those redundancies are the only reason that i am still here today everyone on that helicopter survived the crash
8945224 had i not been trained on what to do in captivity in survival school i would have had a far more difficult time sorting things out
8945225 at the time of the training you think i will never use this its obvious now why that training is needed
8945226 there was not enough contingency resources to allow soldiers to adapt as the mission changed
8945227 it was a strategic failure but a tactical success if we think were going to send people into harms way we are na ve to think no ones going to get hurt when we commit we have to commit all the way
8945228 its all about understanding who within the organization is at the point of the spear the people who get things done in an organization everything in the organization has to support those people

8945232 we explained that it would be impractical for the commission to conduct the investigation in this manner it would imply that we have to negotiate the relevant parts of each and every required document
8945233 we are thrilled to be partnering up with encore to make the micro ds adventure games even more accessible to a larger audience in north america via our download portals
8945234 we look forward to sharing these rich and engaging titles with the download community
8945235 we are glad to be working with legacy interactive to distribute micro ds titles to a wider online audience
8945236 we are confident that our relationship with legacy will be a great success
8945237 woody never liked michigan he respected them but he didnt like them if he could really beat them bad hed do it
8945238 the administration voted not to send us and we had to live with it that was probably the one regret that i had not ever getting to play in a rose bowl
8945239 i really dont give a shit because any monkey with a laptop thinks theyre a dj
8945240 many of our major bank customers already lease with us
8945241 what we have that they dont is the back end capability to resell used equipment we can refurbish it and recycle it so this allows us to be aggressive with our leasing
8945242 we wanted to find a way to help banks get assets off their balance sheets
8945243 we will buy your existing equipment and get it off your books
8945244 this basically takes the equipment off the banks balance sheet and frees up cash its like outsourcing your equipment but you still own the people
8945245 this will be a trend as financial institutions look for liquidity
8945246 whether you lease or buy you still pay the whole bill in the end
8945247 does it allow for upgrades are you able to upgrade just parts of a piece of equipment do you have to upgrade to the existing vendors solutions only or can you go to a different vendor
8945248 they can end early you can opt to buy the equipment or not we try to facilitate the technology refresh and not hold the bank hostage with a financial instrument
8945249 we are delighted to be working with destinys child and square enix to roll out this innovative new game
8945250 dc groove will give fans a creative and fun way to connect with one of the most phenomenally talented groups of all time and the opportunity to experience the thrill of state of the art mobile gaming
8945251 the beautiful thing about this project is that the main people involved in creating it are youthful the same goes for the artists many of their fans as well as our target gamers
8945252 its a game for the young created by the young im confident this landmark project that expands the casual genre of mobile games will be a hit
8945253 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8945254 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8945255 because there was no platform upon which they could stand

8945257 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8945258 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8945259 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8945260 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8945261 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8945262 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8945263 it seems to have similar effects as an antidepressant and antianxiety drug
8945264 soy partidario del derecho de autodeterminaci n es absurdo el miedo al refer ndum
8945265 este pa s sigue siendo el reino de la corrupci n del robo y de la impunidad para los grandes
8945266 el rey estaba en la pomada y acept un golpe de tim n m s parecido a la dictablanda de primo de rivera que a lo de tejero
8945267 hay que ponerse con paciencia a iniciar un proceso que conduzca a la tercera rep blica espa ola
8945268 la generalitat de catalu a y la lehendakaritza son estado espa ol les guste o no
8945269 los que tienen que velar por la constituci n no tienen fuerza moral porque est n atados por los pactos
8945270 el psoe ha conseguido que a su izquierda quede un inmenso campo y sin jornaleros que lo trabajen
8945271 yo pensaba que gonz lez ten a que dimitir pero para que gobernara otro l der de su partido
8945272 por qu se dice que nosotros fuimos los responsables de que aznar ganara
8945273 fue exaltada como mod lica porque se hab a vuelto al sistema democr tico sin traumas y sin sangre pero al paso de 30 a os se ha visto que aquello no fue as se les perdon todo volvi la dinast a borb nica que hab a sido echada de espa a en el 31 y se instaur un sistema llamado democr tico en el que hemos visto que no existe la independencia de los tres poderes
8945274 iniciar un proceso constituyente que conduzca a la tercera rep blica
8945275 estoy convencido de que espa a ma ana ser republicana y en absoluto considero la tercera rep blica heredera de la segunda sino otra de nuevo cu o que debe tener una visi n federal del estado porque lo de hoy es un gazpacho indecente
8945276 pienso que el rey sab a lo que se estaba cociendo no me creo que la junta de defensa nacional y el cesid no informaran al rey de lo que se estaba preparando se puso el traje de capit n general y sali revestido de dem crata pero estaba en la pomada
8945277 para que el pueblo vasco se pueda autodeterminar el pueblo espa ol con la constituci n en la mano tiene que dar esa capacidad estoy harto de este sempiterno juego por una parte utilizan la presi n nacionalista para tener unas ventajas y por otra usan la presi n de la espa a unida para tener otras distintas ha llegado el momento de ver qu ocurre y dar un paso claro para que espa a no se siga desangrando
8945278 una gran chapuza el error ha sido modificar estatutos sin modificar la constituci n con lo cual hemos llegado a una especie de monstruo de frankenstein hecho a pedazos
8945279 coincid amos en pedir la dimisi n de felipe gonz lez pero hay dos cosas que nos diferencian aznar le pide a felipe que dimita y convoque elecciones y yo pensaba que felipe ten a que dimitir pero sin elecciones que gobernara otro l der de su partido por qu se dice que nosotros fuimos los responsables de que aznar ganara
8945280 si hay una constituci n lo normal es que se cumpla lo que pasa es que los que tienen que velar por el cumplimiento de la misma no tienen fuerza moral porque est n atados por pactos y m s pactos ese es el problema el famoso consenso ha sido el cementillo que ha ido aguantando este edificio hasta que llega un momento en que los padres de la patria se encuentran otra vez ante el problema no es que se rompa espa a lo que realmente se est destrozando es la constituci n que est rota por un consenso mal entendido
8945281 en todos estos a os el psoe ha pretendido que seamos la segunda marca para utilizarnos y nosotros hemos ca do en la trampa
8945282 rajoy se ha dado cuenta de que eso del viaje al centro no es ni m s ni menos que coger el sitio del que se ha apoderado el psoe que es de centro pero no de izquierdas
8945283 hubo un tiempo en que de los ocho que mandaban en el secretariado cinco quer an traicionar nuestro proyecto nuestro mal obedece a que la gente del pce y de iu tenemos dignidad seguimos creyendo eso de la derecha contra la izquierda como una lucha tica de proyectos de regates de posiciones y al final nos situamos equivocadamente al lado del psoe por una cuesti n de dignidad mal entendida
8945284 se decreta fijar la fecha del referendo nacional constituyente dirimitorio y aprobatorio para el 7 de diciembre de 2008
8945285 es un d a hist rico porque el decreto garantiza la aprobaci n de la nueva constituci n
8945286 estamos entrando a la recta final y aqu nueva constituci n se encuentra las demandas de todos los sectores sociales el sacrificio de todos los bolivianos
8945287 ahora el soberano podr elegir democr ticamente sobre que modelo de estado prefiere
8945288 el nuevo modelo de estado es incluyente participativo nuestra nueva constituci n nos ofrece eso
8945289 esperamos una asistencia de 50 mil personas as como ocho extensiones dentro del estado por lo que sin lugar a dudas es este el festival m s importante de m sica que se hace en el pa s
8945290 further evidence of the damage done to the uk by the confusion you have caused in the last year over the future of our business tax regime
8945291 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 is the lowest in the sector
8945292 the continuing volatility in the global market for gas is directly contributing to increasing the uks domestic energy prices and scottish power is not immune to these rises
8945293 action is long overdue token gestures will achieve little six price rises from the big six in just five weeks caps a miserable summer for consumers and highlights just how the companies appear to act in step with each other even if not in concert
8945294 the market clearly needs urgent reform electricity and gas regulator ofgems probe into the market on which much will depend is due to report in september it must be a trigger to action to restore competition
8945295 coherent and proportionate action is needed to deal with this crisis

8945302 nosotros no queremos guerra hace poco un pitiyanquito de estos dijo vamos a incendiar esta ciudad y eso es lo que ellos quieren no podemos permit rselo pero para ello hay que trabajar muy duro ahora mismo
8945303 unidos los revolucionarios el pueblo el partido socialista los dem s partidos los batallones hay que ir casa por casa para ganar por knock out todas las alcald as y gobernaciones eso es fundamental para afianzar la revoluci n y adelantar todo este proyecto

8945309 the native americans will reclaim their land amp all other things that are owed to them
8945310 the first will be last amp the last will be first
8945311 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
8945312 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
8945313 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
8945314 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
8945315 may be the biggest single year line item veto total in state history
8945316 i believe everything happens for a purpose in my own personal life if i dedicated back to my creator what im trying to create for the good everything will turn out fine
8945317 maybe if the men of this country were doing what they are supposed to be doing we wouldnt need to elect a woman
8945318 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
8945319 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af
8945320 the new orleans area now has the best flood protection in its history
8945321 that should give you an idea of how much work there still is to do
8945322 the politicians get tears in their eyes when they talk about restoring wetlands but at the same time they push this mega levee system to destroy our natural protections
8945323 you can see on that map how we missed our chance this year
8945324 coastal restoration is just one of those things that politicians say like i owe it all to my lovely wife
8945325 meanwhile we keep building up the coast no matter how many times we get hit on the chin at some point the american public is going to stop paying for chin surgery
8945326 the blood pressure reductions produced by valsartan were clinically relevant and did not cause adverse effects
8945327 anyone who is faithful to god and to his religion and believes in the day of resurrection will never take advantage of this holy month to exploit the people it is sad to see a businessman increasing the prices of foodstuff at the expense of muslims when they should rather have mercy on their fellow muslims and give as much zakat charity as possible
8945328 it is a month full of peace and blessings and as such muslims should not allow unislamic practices to go unchecked
8945329 but if muslims sight the moon on monday september 1 then the following day will be the starting day of fasting
8945330 it is almost a clich of this election that many americans despite a 20 month old campaign still lack a strong notion of who mr
8945331 but mr obamas purpose obviously was to open a direct channel between his candidacy and the personal lives of americans rather than open up about himself
8945332 gone was much of the soaring rhetoric of hope that defined his primary campaign and while he alluded to his biracial international life story and the historic nature of his candidacy he mentioned them only obliquely
8945333 this is the only way we make our living things are getting tougher and tougher
8945334 i dont know what well do if we dont hunt walrus
8945335 hubert needs to finish those carvings today and sell them today and only then can he go to the grocery store
8945336 this winter the maximum ice cover in the bering sea was actually above normal but that doesnt mean it doesnt retreat rapidly in summer
8945337 on land they are really vulnerable to predators and to being trampled by big males when a human or polar bear shows up they panic and stampede
8945338 i am sorry but this is not the way you design a rubric
8945339 i cant do this i dont think you know what you are doing
8945340 yes we realize that there are some problems and we will address them but for now just try to grade it the best way you can
8945341 look i understand what a difficult task the committee has in designing this rubric i training in rubrics so i appreciate the effort it took to get to this point i also understand what bitchy adjunct is trying to say however this is a work in progress so i think we need to try to work out the kinks in a reasonable way so that we can create a viable product
8945342 i so great and i can do this better than you

8945346 its really the only time in your life that youre supposed to gain weight
8945347 they say that youre eating for two but you have to remember that one of the two is only five ounces its not the same
8945348 it was brutal i would order my favorite things from restaurants and i would get it and say get that thing away from me grilled chicken or tomatoes would be the worst i would tell my husband to get it away from me
8945349 i definitely have a sweet tooth with this pregnancy that i didnt have with my son with my son i craved savory things my doctor said to buy fruit at the farmers market i bought a cantaloupe and i had to stop myself from eating the whole thing i cut it up and put it in this big bowl and then next thing i knew half of it was gone
8945350 im addicted to that i definitely still do that while im pregnant i try to make sure i dont do the same thing twice everyday is different and you can shake it up every day
8945351 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 1 75 per litre
8945352 whether gustav ultimately lives up to its hurricane billings and sidelines production like rita and katrina remains to be seen but its very presence in the rig dotted region underscores the vulnerability of u s domestic crude supply to climate change
8945353 just as america has come to rely more and more on gulf production to offset steadily declining production from alaska and the lower 48 states the frequency of high grade storms class 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region has nearly doubled in recent years america s one and only source of production growth could be shut down again and the price impacts would be severe
8945354 everything being equal if you are happy and satisfied with your life now you are more likely to be healthy in the future
8945355 all things considered how satisfied are you with your life

8945357 an unconstitutional regulation designed and intended to ban virtually all citizens from engaging in fundamental rights and liberties on significant portions of public sidewalks and streets
8945358 our year over year trend data shows a grave situation the number of people looking to save money by buying pharmaceuticals over the web is growing rapidly while scammers are more aggressively exploiting loose controls over online sales of drugs
8945359 as consumers increasingly turn to the internet to buy medications brandholders must ensure these customers are not faced with the potentially life threatening risk of buying fake or sub standard medications
8945360 i sat back down to eat with my knife and fork in my hand
8945361 she grabbed the food on my plate i stood up and lashed out with my hand

8945363 i am confident that this year too we will be more or less correct in our assessment of yearly growth for example last year i was the only one who maintained that it would be close to nine per cent and eventually it turned out to be 9 1 per cent i am confident this year also growth will be close to eight per cent

8945366 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8945367 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8945368 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8945369 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8945370 o botafogo um exemplo muito claro do que tem sido esse campeonato com uma s rie de vit rias saiu de uma posi o desconfort vel para viver agora uma possibilidade de classifica o para a libertadores

8945508 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
8945509 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
8945510 i was rushed by a police officer without warning and lifted up off the ground and was cuffed i was then dragged by the police into the westin hotel
8945511 it was understood by the young women that sidewalk chalk was an accepted medium and they were given no warning by the police before being cuffed and dragged away
8945512 i think the officers were keyed up were not sure whether they acted of their own accord or had orders
8945513 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
8945514 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
8945515 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here
8945516 i am shocked at how cowardly these police officers behaved by attacking little girls without warning or provocation
8945517 ik heb geluiden uit de markt opgevangen dat er behoefte is aan kwalitatief hoogwaardig onderwijs op het gebied van goederenvervoer het zal innovatie bevorderen ik ben verheugd dat we hiermee in brabant voorop kunnen lopen
8945518 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8945519 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8945520 to develop equipment for potential combat use against ground based ballistic missiles
8945521 russia is saying once again that has the opportunity to overcome u s missile defense
8945522 such tests are planned in advance maybe but its unlikely
8945523 experience shows the most economical and quickly achievable countermeasures against the development of a missile defense system are so called asymmetrical measures
8945524 most likely this is an old topol maybe slightly modernized
8945525 these missiles are to be stationed alongside our border and they are a threat to us we have to respond somehow to this situation and naturally enough we have to take a military response
8945526 it appeared from the question naire one of the ways they were getting alcohol was from their parents either unknown to them or as a case of here you go have a drink
8945527 i dont think that would change if we raised the age limit to 21
8945528 if i go and buy alcohol and give it to somebody in the street i could end up in jail but now weve got parents who are handing out alcohol willy nilly to their children
8945529 with youngsters aged between 17 and 18 parents have a difficult enough task keeping it under control and if we push it up to 21 we will push it underground
8945530 bravado among teenagers about being able to get drink under age
8945531 bairns see sensible use of alcohol in their own home more so than they do in our society
8945532 you can get married at 16 you can do lots of things but if you cant have a drink until youre 21 its nonsense
8945533 over 18s are contributing members of society there are many of them fighting for us in iraq and afghanistan and we are in danger of stigmatising the next generation by going for this
8945534 but in this community im not sure this is the right way to fix it
8945535 there has always been restric tions on pubs with things like happy hours so this brings more equity among licensed premises
8945536 its making it fairer for pubs than it has been before
8945537 weve got adverts on tv where they are selling bottles of beer cheaper than a bottle of water and theres duty included on the beer
8945538 this has been going on since 1991 and from some folks memories the early 70s successive councils have struggled with this and we have to decide as a council to get on with it
8945539 education of the children thats going to go there has to be the first priority and anything thats going to detract from that we will have to look at very seriously
8945540 i move we consider getting on with this since being elected in 2007 twice there has been a democratic decision made in this chamber we should build on the knab
8945541 we should approve the report with the proviso we dont exclude other sites if the knab proves to be too costly it doesnt matter where its built as long as it is built soon and within budget
8945542 there is one other consideration thats important and thats cost the charitable trust will provide it but thats 5 million a year out of the capital programme well have to think a lot about what to leave out
8945543 im in favour of moving away from the present site because its going to be more and more disruptive for pupils
8945544 the report is comprehensive but it has been written under pressure and in a hurry
8945545 im reluctant to mention it but the report doesnt inspire confidence in what has happened so far
8945546 consultation to my reading consists of telling people what has been decided and when its going to happen consultation should take place before and during the process
8945547 i wonder how long were going to have staff and pupils suffering while we wait as costs go through the roof
8945548 a lot of the blame lies at this table because weve just kept on changing our minds i understand steel prices may be falling at the moment but in every situation delay means inflation
8945549 of course we have difficulties and a relationship to maintain with residents around the knab but youll only have a new set of relationships to build up if you move to a different area i still believe the decision we have been working on since 2003 04 is the right one
8945550 ominous specter haunted leaguer ambiance muliebral gasps about intimidation yep this is precisely a halloween concept drained commit robbery astral spirit minimal art
8945551 no more 2000s and 2004s the republican party mounted a coordinated criminal campaign to steal the 2004 presidential election and it worked now as another election approaches you and i need to stand together to make absolutely certain it doesnt happen again we need your support to raise the funds now to make sure that no voter is left behind on election day
8945552 today democrats for americas future is launching its nationwide novoterleftbehind net project that will monitor voting on election day in 2008 the squad will shine a public spotlight on every last irregularity democrats for americas future will urge every democratic candidate not to concede a single race until every last vote is counted and from beginning to end from the voter registration process to election day challenges and beyond daf will fight every last fight to the very end insisting that every american is guaranteed a democracys most sacred right their vote
8945553 heres the challenge we have every reason to believe the republicans are at this moment preparing a 2008 vote suppression effort that will rival or even exceed the dirty tricks they pulled in 2004
8945554 i pledge that i will make sure that every vote is counted and that i will contest any evidence of theft or other voter suppression
8945555 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
8945556 i saw him get hit he was knocked out when he fell he was hit on the side of his face the police said the skateboard was very heavy
8945557 i saw the group of people there before it happened and i dont know how it all happened but i could tell there was a lot of tension
8945558 afterwards his fiancee was kneeling down next to him i called the ambulance with her
8945559 assure students and staff that there is no threat to their personal security this appears to be a one off incident
8945560 i will stand down as treasurer before the mini budget in november if there is not the will to address this
8945561 there is no point being treasurer if people arent prepared to make difficult decisions on public sector reforms
8945562 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget does not return the aaa credit rating to a sustainable path
8945563 ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw to return it to a sustainable path the world has changed we do not have the luxury of waiting to reform
8945564 this mini budget will require hard decisions to do that its crunch time
8945565 because of ofarrell public sector reform is no longer a luxury we cant afford to wait
8945566 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
8945567 i regard the power reforms as necessary but as a legacy reform issue the real reform is adjusting our revenues and expenditure
8945568 there is no other way to get the state into a sustainable position
8945569 i will stand down as treasurer before the mini budget in november if there is not the will to address this

8945605 a republican source confirms that john mccain has chosen alaska governor sarah palin to be his running mate campaign officials however remain mum this morning
8945606 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8945607 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8945608 people will start to suspect that there is an ulterior motive for changing the date indeed i suspect there is an ulterior motive for wanting to change the date
8945609 you just know how many of these polling cards will sit on the mantelpiece during christmas we should have it in january when the pressure is off people
8945610 it was decided that a separate survey of local businesses would take place in january but this would not be a referendum and the weight attached to the result would be decided at a later date
8945611 have you got any of the following items in your luggage towel toothbrush bomb
8945612 one day i shall move from this beastly spot and stare at different part of the curtains
8945613 walk from one end of the stage to the other
8945614 transmission charging is one of the challenges we face and whether we need a cap still remains to be seen a lot of key arguments the consultants have used are open to challenge
8945615 charges for islands are steeped in uncertainty we just have to make a cool calculated decision after the different elements are taken into account transmission charging is a key element and if its uneconomic or it is unclear the project cant go ahead
8945616 its something we require crystal clarity on its an over reaction to say it will be the downfall or making of viking energy its another challenge and something we need to work at
8945617 what we will be arguing is its not possible to reach a judgement on capping now against a moving background its too early to say whether transmission charging is a show stopper or not what we do require is some clarity and a need for the government to retain some flexibility
8945618 there has been uncertainty about the connection and how its going to be handled for some time
8945619 i know there is a strong element in the scottish government that are very keen to see the cable connection paid for on a postage stamp basis meaning one price for all areas
8945620 there is quite a long way to go that is one of the things we have to figure out before we make a decision one way or another im still relaxed about it its just one of those things where we have to see what happens
8945621 scotland is united against the national grids electricity trans mis sion charging regime which works against the development of clean renewable energy in scotland
8945622 there is no justification for charg ing a power station in lon gannet 33 million when it would pay not
8945623 similarly peterhead would be charged 30 million while a power station in seabank in the southwest of england would be paid 3
8945624 this includes pushing for sen sible arrangements for grid access and management we will soon pro pose to ofgem an alternative regime which they could implement
8945625 ofgem calculates that existing subsidies for renewable energy already constitute eight per cent of consumers bills
8945626 in the current climate of spiral ling energy bills you may like to consider whether consumers should be asked to pay more to subsidise profitable energy companies
8945627 this decision is a major u turn on the part of the new labour government at westminster and one which could kill stone dead the development of renewable electricity generation in the northern isles
8945628 while the energy minister has talked a good game on renewables at his first major test he has failed in industry miserably
8945629 the regulator ofgem has never liked the idea of putting a cap on renewable charges it was to the governments credit that they were prepared to create the power to place a cap on the charges
8945630 there is no point however in having such a power if they are not prepared to use it
8945631 it is now essential to get every one round the table to sort this out that is why i am seeking a meeting with the energy minister and the chairman of ofgem
8945632 the government has got to ex plain if it really does want to see re newables developed in the northern isles or not if they do then ofgem has got to explain why it is so determined to thwart government policy
8945633 is going to determine how when and probably where people live
8945634 we have the potential to power the whole of scotland with orkney
8945635 we have to look at getting ourselves self sufficient as soon as possible we have one generation to get it right
8945636 we are delighted to work with audi due to their professional expertise in the car industry

8945641 spa ist eine phantastische rennstrecke mit einzigartigen kurven und einem ganz besonderen charakter die kombination eau rouge in der senke wird zwar heutzutage mit den v8 motoren problemlos mit vollgas gefahren aber sie bleibt trotzdem etwas besonderes spa ist im aktuellen kalender die n chstgelegene grand prix strecke zu meiner heimat m nchengladbach das ist f r mich ein weiterer grund mich auf den gro en preis von belgien zu freuen wo ich wieder ein besseres ergebnis erzielen will
8945642 f r mich ist der gro e preis von belgien einer der besten im kalender die rennstrecke ist einzigartig mit sehr schnellen kurven die unterschiedliche linien zulassen der kurs ist sehr lang und knifflig man muss die richtige balance und fahrzeug konfiguration finden um keine rundenzeit zu verlieren ein anderer entscheidender faktor in belgien ist das wetter es kann gleichzeitig auf einem streckenabschnitt regnen auf einem anderen aber trocken sein
8945643 in nicks f1 08 wird turnusgem ein neuer bmw p86 8 motor mit einem neuen getriebe arbeiten robert wird mit demselben antrieb wie in valencia fahren
8945644 in den ersten zwei saisondritteln hatten wir keinen einzigen ausfall wegen eines defektes zu beklagen das hohe niveau in der zuverl ssigkeit wollen wir halten sportlich wollen wir uns weiter steigern und in spa wieder mit beiden autos solide in die punkter nge fahren
8945645 wir fuhren so hart wie wir konnten und lagen nur sieben zehntelsekunden zur ck ungl cklicherweise wirkten wir den motor ab und er wollte einfach nicht wieder starten wir mussten das auto anschieben und gingen zu sp t in die etappe das kostete uns wertvolle zeit die wir nun morgen zur ckzugewinnen versuchen m ssen
8945646 es ist absolut frustrierend es war unm glich das potential des autos wirklich zu nutzen die oberste schotterschicht war an manchen stellen so dick dass unsere reifen die wir in diesem jahr nicht mehr nachschneiden d rfen einfach keinen grip aufbauen konnten sogar als dritter auf der stra e mussten wir die strecke immer noch sauber fahren
8945647 der heutige tag war sehr hart wir griffen hart an aber wird sind zu weit weg von der spitze wir hatten probleme mit einer besch digten frontaufh ngung heute morgen hatten wir kaum grip das wurde am nachmittag besser aber bei unserer startposition h tten wir einfach schneller sein m ssen
8945648 michelin wurde nach den letzten zwei drei rennen sehr unter druck gesetzt und das zurecht
8945649 aber sie scheinen an diesem wochenende gute arbeit geleistet zu haben
8945650 aber es ist noch sehr fr h am wochenende und wir sind erst wenige runden gefahren
8945651 zur rallye selbst kann ich nur sagen es wird sicher sehr schwer werden denn markus moufang mit seinem b renstarken bmw und auch frank riechert sind sicher sehr hoch einzusch tzen zumal ich in diesem jahr nicht wie die letzen jahre mit meinem gruppe a auto starten kann sondern auf das seriennahe gruppe n auto zur ckgreifen werde
8945652 the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
8945653 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect
8945654 there was so much to grok so little to grok from

8945660 john mccain says hes a maverick but hes voted with bush over 90 of the time
8945661 hes a fantastic player and under normal circumstances you would not want to lose a player like him
8945662 i want to stress it was 100 my decision to sell him though
8945663 it was difficult for him he almost signed for them once and got dragged back
8945664 i wish him all the best in the world hes a player ive really enjoyed working with and im sure martin oneill will enjoy working with him as well because you cant help but enjoy working with good professionals
8945665 i wouldnt have sold him if i didnt believe at the end of the day we would move this club forward and thats what were going to do
8945666 when you weigh it up its right for everybody the lads done nothing wrong the fans shouldnt think bad about him at the end of the day he wanted it and good luck to him
8945667 despite the fact that to our fans it wont look like a positive move im convinced what will happen in the next two or three days and in the future for this club will be positive
8945668 we had a great meeting the owners absolutely committed to the club theres no doubt about that
8945669 its a case of us trying to get the quality we want to bring in its very easy to bring players in at this time of year
8945670 the secret is if youre going to let a good player go to replace him for another player who can maybe take you in another direction
8945671 thats the challenge we have and i look forward to it
8945672 oh but its better than anything on tv at the moment

8945685 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it

8945687 what non obvious things can nerds who are so inclined do to help the democrats win in november
8945688 about 90 of the national elections use use a device called the shouptronic to count the votes the shouptronic is a closed system that isnt open for inspection several groups argue that it has been used to fix the vote in elections this is a good argument to use an open system for election counting

8945713 gandhi and churchill the epic rivalry that destroyed an empire and forged our age
8945714 people like myself get a lot of attention when we talk about issues like abortion and family life but not when we talk about helping low income people
8945715 matthew 25 gives us the opportunity to try to get candidates to focus on these concerns

8945718 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8945719 you have an overwhelming urge for sex and are so intensely preoccupied with it that your health job relationships or other areas of your life are affected
8945720 while i am confident that we continue to market a high quality product i take very seriously any concerns that are expressed which question the quality of that product
8945721 it is vitally important that we continue to meet the demands of the marketplace in a positive and responsible manner
8945722 there is growing competition in the marketplace and we must ensure that we continue to maintain and strengthen the quality of our product
8945723 there is an urgent need to scale up integrated emergency livelihood and humanitarian assistance currently humanitarian access is insufficient to meet the growing humanitarian needs and humanitarian agencies are struggling to maintain a presence
8945724 we need to scale up and speed up our support my personal conviction and also our collective conscience tell us to take action
8945725 the support for somalia is not able to be translated to security on the ground we need physical measures on the ground currently we are getting only 1 of the money we asked for in our emergency appeal
8945726 we are talking about an operation that needs money we are on a shoe string budget the high cost of security is worsened by the high need to provide air services
8945727 we are facing a variety of security problems the abductions of un humanitarian workers it is a commercial crime given the amount of ransom we have had threats against the international staff it is very difficult for us to carry out these operations

8945737 we chose the term market rather than store because we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available
8945738 similar to youtube content can debut in the marketplace after only three simple steps register as a merchant upload and describe your content and publish it we also intend to provide developers with a useful dashboard and analytics to help drive their business and ultimately improve their offerings

8945740 in afrika nutzt man ein handy dazu um sammlungen von bildern oder clips anzulegen die man dann kollektiv im freundeskreis austauscht so kann man sich gegenseitig ber die neuesten trends informieren oder sich ber die besten clips die pr sidentenwahl im mali oder auch ber religi se themen austauschen
8945741 die tatsache dass afrika versp tung in sachen infrastruktur hat kann eine chance sein neuere technologien zu nutzen ziel ist dass lokale entscheidungstr ger soviel wie m glich ber aktuelle technologien informiert werden die es ihnen erm glichen die preise f r die infrastruktur drastisch zu reduzieren

8945743 der senat hat seine bisherige rechtsprechung zur untreue auf wirtschaftsunternehmen bertragen
8945744 ich erkenne eindeutig die absicht des senats der korruption einen riegel vorzuschieben
8945745 the press release recently filed by the dissident group appears to imply that your board is not willing to consider a sale of the company
8945746 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
8945747 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these olympics
8945748 the police dont even call us they dont keep me updated about any developments because there are none when it comes to looking for missing persons there is no equality between the searches for amna and the girl from netanya searching for the jewish girl even though her disappearance was announced after a long time
8945749 my heart goes out to rose but i feel that the police have stopped helping my daughter we havent given up the search but instead of keeping us updated we are the ones who keep the police updated
8945750 i expect the police to do its duty it doesnt matter what is the persons sex or what language they speak be it arabic english french or yiddish if a person goes missing they need to be found
8945751 those early moments of her disappearance were not easy we talked to most of the village no one saw anything no one remembered seeing her walking down the street around midnight after we asked everyone we could we arrived at the police station and reported her disappearance since then we have had no new information
8945752 the aunt is convinced that the girl who called was amna herself but we have no way to confirm that
8945753 every piece of information that comes in about the missing girl is checked out we also follow up on rumors but nothing has come from those sadly the girl is still missing it s a mystery we are talking about a normal 15 year old girl and no one knows what happened to her
8945754 the police questioned the family and the girls who go to school with her and came up with nothing she was not having any sort of problems with her parents i think she was kidnapped or that she was tricked she did not go willingly
8945755 we drew up a plan searched all of northern israel but the police stayed in their building they would call in and see if we had anything new to report
8945756 the difference in the amount of personal used is staggering the police commissioner showed up and they are pulling out all the stops to find her we on the other hand did not even get 20 of the personnel used to find rose my heart aches for every girl that goes missing but i would like the search for amna to be this intense the first moments when a person goes missing are critical and the police did not help us
8945757 i hope that people with information about my daughter would come forward people call the house and say that they saw her somewhere but wont give any details i would expect the police to receive these calls each call like that is devastating to us
8945758 defendants maintain a series of web sites purporting to provide product reviews to consumers
8945759 the defendants web site claim to contain unbiased and helpful consumer information however the reviews are fake and the web sites are nothing more than a marketing scheme for defendants competing products which they promote on the sites the defendants recently targeted one of cycs successful products by purchasing the brand name as a key word on search engines such as google when a consumer enters cycs product name as a search term the defendants web site purportedly reviewing the product is displayed as a search result along with cycs product name and inflammatory language like warning and scam prominently displayed in the search result the defendants instead divert consumers using cycs proprietary content to their competing products with lies and misinformation as a result defendants derive profit by deceiving unsuspecting consumers at the expense of both the consumers and cyc in violation of federal trademark and copyright laws and various other state laws
8945760 well weve got a bit of a race on now
8945761 dance and fitness studio to teach women how to pole dance power lap dance and strip tease all while fully clothed
8945762 the small town municipal officials do not approve of the type of dance she teaches they believe it is provocative full of sexual innuendo and too dangerous for their township
8945763 the instruction contains absolutely no nudity spectators or sexual activity
8945764 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8945765 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8945766 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8945767 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council

8945772 posthumous baptisms by proxy have been common practice for the mormons for more than a century allowing the dead to be baptised into the faith so they may be united in the after life

8945774 ddpp started as a way to work out and have fun without the conformity of a gym how often have you heard your favorite song while youre on the treadmill and wanted to hop off to do a real running man
8945775 but it has morphed into this amazing revolution of sorts where women come to find that little girl inside us all who just wants to have fun
8945776 why we decide to reveal our inner spaz to this room of mostly strangers is unclear
8945777 continued to manufacture distribute market promote and sell pergolide without revealing to physicians and the public the risks posed by pergolide

8945820 i think to be fair to scottish natural heritage they convened a scientific panel that looked at flight paths they were keen to establish an exclusion zone and the aim was to provide a workable solution
8945821 unfortunately it has resulted in a decrease in unit numbers but it has allowed the development to go through and we will still be able to create 15 000 homes for the city
8945822 i suspect that because of the scale of the project forth ports will try to be as accommodating to objectors as is possible
8945823 but we have a huge shortage of homes particularly affordable homes in edinburgh and we cannot afford to reduce them
8945824 as the site includes two special protection areas protected by european law it was important to get this right
8945825 the project will now move forward to more detailed consideration of the various phases of the development we are hopeful that we can continue to work closely with forth ports and the council
8945826 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral

8945828 just a star thats how cops refer to people like tim just a star

8945835 its not just he that made the ultimate sacrifice its his family that sacrificed him being with them so it really is a huge tremendous sacrifice its a sacrifice for us to miss him but nothing like for the family we hurt with them
8945836 no individuals should be anywhere near that type of equipment especially to use as transportation up or down
8945837 he was the best employee we had its like losing family
8945838 layne was truly a unique individual he was a loving family man an intelligent and innovative farmer a great business manager an expert pilot and a true cowboy he was equally comfortable in a corporate boardroom on a tractor in the pilots seat or on the back of a horse

8945854 we dont want brussels to legislate against calf exports because were trying to work to find solutions for the calf export problem

8945885 i really do get fed up with this constant comparison its comparing apples with pears im not trying to say they hjaltland housing dont get bad tenants but it is reasonable to assume the council gets a higher proportion we are dealing with people at the margins of society its quite shocking in this century that people are living in these conditions
8945886 i dont mind us being criticised or set challenges but that does need to be in the context of what staff have to face i dont want to set challenges that are unrealistic sometimes some properties cant be turned around as quickly as everyone would like
8945887 homeless folk are housed all the time and decent folk wont be

8945892 it is very satisfying that through a team approach we have been able to make significant improvements to the quality of experience for our learners and that this has been recognised by hmie clearly we will continue to seek to make improvements through tackling the areas for development identified by the inspectors i want shetland college to build on its success and be a place where students and staff enjoy learning and working together
8945893 bodes well for the future of shetland college and learners throughout shetland
8945894 if wed had the opportunity we would have said first build a breakwater with whatever you have left build a terminal had there been the oppor tunities for fishing tourism you can never really say how big an effect it would have had but the opportunity was never there the breakwater is the main thing if that doesnt come it doesnt give you a chance to explore all the gear that might come from that
8945895 the realisation is starting to hit that without doing something within the next five to ten years therell be nobody here in fetlar
8945896 unless something is done well be the last ones here my generation the folk thats now in their 50s thatll be the last folk thats going to be on the isle
8945897 its a bit late in the day but the provision of a breakwater is essential because that enables the ferry to be berthed in fetlar
8945898 it is such a beautiful island a fantastic place to live its green its got won derful beaches its got everything people have tried hard over the years to make it work but obviously one of the biggest needs is new population
8945899 there are people willing to look at making land available but theyre not gonna give up land willy nilly there needs to be a sort of filter process obviously the smaller the community the more dangerous it is to introduce people that perhaps may come with a very optimistic rose coloured view of what island living is and then feel very disillusioned after two years
8945900 the community is aware that the breakwater alone will not solve fetlars problems but it will go a very long way towards breaking the vicious circle that currently exists where many development projects are unviable and relocation to the isle is unattractive or unfeasible for new residents due to the restricted and at times unreliable service
8945901 in the past year several recent incomers have left the island as commuting to the mainland proved to be unfeasible even a new resident with a good business plan would need to earn money elsewhere while the business became established
8945902 the important thing for the islands and they are doing this is to behave in a confident optimistic way because that makes them an attractive venue for people either to go and live or start a business or a new enterprise
8945903 a lot of the people are con cerned particularly as a lot of them rely on agriculture traditionally thats how people lived nowadays people have a higher level of expectation of income but if we got the infrastructure both of the breakwater and improved telecoms that could be the key
8945904 there is a short window of opportunity to turn the situation around if no progress is made dur ing the next five years the situation in fetlar could be very poor indeed
8945905 i am con scious that the population has become too small for the com munity to turn it around them selves
8945906 people are leaving not because they dont have a widescreen multiplex
8945907 this is great land and its a pity to see it out of use
8945908 maybe all the smaller islands need to have the focus put on them have this kind of treatment if they want it to check out that were not missing any oppor tunities keep an eye on potentially difficult situations that might be arising
8945909 we have to do something or well end up with three nature reserves and human beings as an endangered species

8945911 i am delighted to be here today to perform the opening of this site and celebrate with you what is a wonderful local achievement the work carried out here has really increased local historical knowledge but has also brought about a closer understanding of the importance of these sites in centuries past and how important it is to preserve them so that we can continue to learn from them
8945912 i think that all the people involved in the project have actually shown great foresight in preserving the burnt mound as has been shown from the various experiments that have been carried at open days and today there are still gaps in our knowledge and if we can find out more answers to current speculation then it will benefit future generations in their learning of history
8945913 it is so good to see all this coming together in the way it has today

8945927 nnrtis have been trusted by physicians and used in antiretroviral therapy for more than a decade but nnrti resistance has limited the use of this important class of hiv medication
8945928 intelence extends the nnrti class to thousands of treatment experienced patients in europe who have nnrti resistant virus providing them with the potential to suppress their virus to undetectable levels the ultimate treatment goal
8945929 the approval of intelence demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing innovative therapies for treatment experienced hiv patients
8945930 we are committed to working with national health authorities to quickly make this drug available to people living with hiv in europe who need new treatment options
8945931 while we do hit all of the baptist camps in the state well do anything that needs doing

8945933 people tend to forget many of us are skilled in our respected craft
8945934 whats the going rate for a skilled laborer a plumber an electrician or a painter these days it is probably more than these places can afford
8945935 they not only provide us a significant financial saving but are just a joy to be around
8945936 if we didnt have them here wed either have to use internal camp people which would mean something else wouldnt get done or wed have to hire someone from off site to do the work and that would be so expensive
8945937 were just a bunch of dedicated christian folks who can do just about anything that needs to be done

8945942 and we usually have devotion around 7 45 a m we take a break at 10 have lunch at noon and break again at 3 p m we usually quit around 4 30 in the afternoon and eat supper around 5 p m
8945943 our sole purpose when we come to a location is to work
8945944 we want to utilize our time as much as possible if we had to stop to cook and clean up afterwards it would take us away from why we are there
8945945 it really helps the time pass when you have more than two or three people on a job
8945946 the job gets finished quicker and you have someone to talk with as you work
8945947 we have really been blessed this week by the great speakers and music lc has provided for us
8945948 usually we recruit through word of mouth whatever publicity we can get or through the respective churches
8945949 except for the places where we work a lot of people dont even realize we exist
8945950 we have a mission emphasis and we would encourage more people to join us there is always plenty of work to go around

8945989 many of our major bank customers already lease with us
8945990 what we have that they dont is the back end capability to resell used equipment we can refurbish it and recycle it so this allows us to be aggressive with our leasing
8945991 we wanted to find a way to help banks get assets off their balance sheets
8945992 we will buy your existing equipment and get it off your books
8945993 this basically takes the equipment off the banks balance sheet and frees up cash its like outsourcing your equipment but you still own the people
8945994 this will be a trend as financial institutions look for liquidity
8945995 whether you lease or buy you still pay the whole bill in the end
8945996 does it allow for upgrades are you able to upgrade just parts of a piece of equipment do you have to upgrade to the existing vendors solutions only or can you go to a different vendor
8945997 they can end early you can opt to buy the equipment or not we try to facilitate the technology refresh and not hold the bank hostage with a financial instrument

8946004 findings up to date suggest that other companies belonging to the alstom group made corrupt payments to officials or functionaries via the alstom prom ag based in baden which in some cases might have led to the awarding of contracts
8946005 for the moment we have no comments whatsoever on the subject
8946006 at the beginning of the bid process we were there but we are no longer
8946007 i am not aware of anything the people who are looking at the ttc contract have been on vacation since mid august it is normal for me not to be made aware of any contacts any new developments
8946008 on aug 13 alstom submitted information about how they would meet the ttcs requirements to operate streetcars subsequent to those meetings there have been follow up discussions
8946009 we will have to wait and see what the charges are obviously thats not how the ttc conducts business
8946010 from our perspective its a question is it a fair and open bid
8946011 we were under the impression that the bidding process was still open and we were still part of it
8946012 we are doing things as instructed and it does seem very strange that comments would be made with regards to who the final people are without actually telling the people who are investing the time and money to put their bids together

8946091 another view that is being addressed to the ummah is the concept of fighting the rulers and that through military struggle islam will return to the world stage again this is based upon a particular hadith it has been narrated from many sources including imam muslim that the prophet saw said do not challenge the people of authority unless you see explicit kufr of which you have clear proof from allah from islam ibn kathir in his tafseer states that if the khaleefah reverts to the rule of disbelief he would be fought until he returned to the implementation of islam and the shariah ibn hajr in his fateh al bari also states that if he becomes a kafir or changes the shari ah he should be fought and removed this view is also mentioned in nayl al awtar and supported by imam shawkani that is if the ruler rules by other than the shariah he is fought until he either repents or is removed however that is the only situation that it applies to i e the ruling of a khaleefah who resorts to the kufr ruling and disobedience to allah it does not relate to the khaleefah becoming tyrannical and also does not relate to his personality becoming corrupt in which case obedience to him is binding and the muslims should still pray behind him and fight jihad behind him however these ahadith are not connected to the current situation they are all connected to revolt and rising against the khaleefah and are titled under the subject of khurooj min al khaleefah i e rising against the authority of a khaleefah or an imam the current situation is not that of the khulafaa who used to rule by islam and then turned away from islam the current problem is also not merely related to removing a ruler by killing him rather entire systems of kufr have been implemented over muslims for over 76 years none of the rulers have ever ruled by the shari ah and none of them are khulafaa within a khilafah the systems that they are applying are either monarchies or capitalistic with some sort of democratic framework hence the reality isn t that of removing a bad khaleefah within an islamic state the reality is of uprooting an entire kufr system including it s ruler to again establish dar ul islam the current rulers are not comparable in any way to khulafaa who have introduced one kufr law into the khilafah hence these ahadith which have always been understood in the context of dar ul islam i e where islam is implemented and the muslims possess the security do not apply upon the current situation the reality which they address is that of removing a khaleefah who rules with kufr within the islamic state not that of uprooting an entire kufr system merely by fighting and the only situation that is comparable from the evidences is the establishment of the islamic state for the very first time by the prophet saw and the struggle which he saw went through in order to establish this state and change dar ul kufr to dar ul islam this is the struggle which he saw referred to in the hadith of hamza and as is illustrated in the books of sunnah and seerah as that is the only instance in which a complete system of kufr existed and was changed to a complete system of islam so the matter is regarding the changing of a system not merely a ruler the ahadith of fighting apply to changing a ruler i e a khaleefah who has gone astray not a system only the struggle of the prophet saw in makkah applies to the changing of a system so military struggle is not the method of re establishing the khilafah

8946164 manufacturing is not sexy there are a lot of sexy industries out there that are competing for the same talent i think that manufacturing has to invest heavily in branding
8946165 canadas manufacturing industry can be characterized as being made up of a predominantly aging male work force
8946166 since the beginning of this decade overall growth in the manufacturing sector has stalled even as the rest of the economy has expanded and about 300 000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared
8946167 there is no doubt that some segments are facing structural challenges such as increased import competition which has been further aggravated by the slowdown in the u s economy however all is not gloom and doom in the sector
8946168 their human resources challenges including early retirements a below average level of work force education a reduced ability to attract young workers and changing skills requirements
8946169 the increased skill level that you see and gymnastics practised at younger ages that coupled with an increase in the intensity and the hours of training that are required to remain competitive thats really led to the concern regarding the risk and severity and the long term effects on young gymnasts
8946170 shes been training at a very experienced club as far as we know

8946173 it is an inter generational inter sectoral problem that needs multi sectoral solutions
8946174 for the country to tackle this crisis effectively the root cause of malnutrition must be addressed through appropriate prevention strategies
8946175 malnutrition in children was a contributing factor to more than half of all child mortality cases while malnutrition in mothers accounted for a substantial proportion of neonatal mortality

8946223 every school will need an investment of rs 30 million while the central government will bear 75 per cent of the cost the state governments share would be 25 per cent
8946224 we want to make sure that all deserving students have access to some good schools

8946243 football euphoria has been unleashed even among people who werent very interested in soccer before
8946244 playing in the bundesliga is like being a teenager invited to your older brothers party with girls for the first time
8946245 envy and hatred follows us wherever we go weve been voted germanys most unpopular club
8946246 a lot of people think a millionaire has injected a lot of money into the club and without that they wouldnt be where they are now
8946247 they have to prove themselves to earn respect its like the envy people have for rich new kids on the block
8946248 apart from bayern munich german clubs do not pay the wages needed to attract top flight players who mainly go to england
8946249 i am pleased that the fco is leading government in the area of gaining a better understanding of the impacts of its expenditure decisions on carbon emissions throughout the supply chain understanding the carbon emissions and policies of our suppliers will help to embed the sustainability agenda within our procurement decision making
8946250 the public sector has enormous power to shape new markets through its procurement practices and these organisations are showing the way in the development of a low carbon economy
8946251 my father disappeared and my mother found his body in the morgue they dumped my brothers body in the river
8946252 my husband took me to see some of his relatives id not seen before i stayed the night then in the morning they brought me breakfast with apricot juice it tasted funny so i asked what was in it they told me nothing just drink
8946253 if we meet in the next life will you choose me or another man
8946254 i never intended to blow myself up when stopped at the checkpoint i wanted to turn myself in but i was afraid
8946255 nobody told me how to use this vest i dont know if they meant to blow me up by remote control i just dont know
8946256 the fact hes not shown up to help me yet shows he must have something to hide
8946257 all i can say is that im not going to be there and i plan on being at the minnesota state fair and so you can draw your conclusions from that i just cant comment further at this time
8946258 we have received instructions at the foreign ministry and we will cut diplomatic relations with the russian federation
8946259 georgias interests in russia will be represented by the embassy of a third party
8946260 we are doing everything we can so druzhba can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
8946261 we have worked for many years to gain not just the image but the status of a reliable energy supplier to europe and we would never let it suffer even in this political situation
8946262 lukoil is delivering the same amount of oil and oil products to western europe as before
8946263 gazprom is going to make 60 billion this year from exporting gas to europe its highly unlikely that on some kind of whim it would suddenly decide that it didnt want to do that
8946264 that a cutoff of european supplies is someones stupid insinuation
8946265 there is no point in that kind of sanctions the west gets russian oil by sea one way or another
8946266 and what would russia do with the oil put it back in the ground and what about the fact that oil sales form the base of its currency inflows there were buyers for russian oil even at the height of the cold war
8946267 only a sick mind would think of cutting off europe
8946268 technically it is practically impossible since russian refineries are running at maximum rates and it is difficult to arbitrage right now
8946269 weve lost our homes weve lost our clothes weve lost everything
8946270 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
8946271 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
8946272 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
8946273 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
8946274 the camps are not organized yet and we are receiving reports of diseases
8946275 biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8946276 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
8946277 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
8946278 i think the decision will be more in favor of cutting diplomatic ties
8946279 if i had to rate obamas speech on a scale of 1 to 10
8946280 to my mind even if obama is not elected i think his nomination can help turn the tide on race relations forever in this country

8946286 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8946287 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8946288 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8946289 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office
8946290 lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8946291 the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8946292 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8946293 if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums
8946294 if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
8946295 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8946296 but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy

8946322 deplored russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8946323 this step is biased and is aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8946324 it ignores russias well argued stance in favor of the difficult but under the existing circumstances the only right decision to recognize south ossetias and abkhazias independence
8946325 in accordance with this plan some russian peacekeepers remain deployed in a security zone neighboring south ossetia

8946329 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
8946330 i would humbly request him that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
8946331 mr zardari is the pakistan peoples partys unanimous choice and he accepted our request to take the nomination for the position of president
8946332 we have received instructions at the foreign ministry and we will cut diplomatic relations with the russian federation

8946338 will the fans all be behind me all i can do is give 100 per cent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8946339 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
8946340 am i here for the long haul i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided ill be staying at villa
8946341 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8946342 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
8946343 is there any ill feeling with martin oneill not at all the manager knows i will be giving 100 per cent for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone
8946344 its also nice hearing your team mates wanting you to stay we have got a great dressing room you want everyone to stay really but i would have been disappointed if they wanted me to leave
8946345 the manager has decided to change the captaincy and ive got no problem with that nigel reo coker has done it and martin laursen has done it
8946346 i enjoyed being captain but it wont affect my performances
8946347 i feel i am getting back to my best it is going to take a while it wasnt the ideal pre season for me so i guess the games are always the best thing
8946348 it was a nice run out even if it was at left back
8946349 obama the first black presidential nominee of a major u s party linked mccain directly to president george w bush and said their failed republican policies were responsible for a faltering u s economy and a decline in u s global standing
8946350 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8946351 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8946352 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
8946353 we suspect bdnf involves many important functions in several areas of the brain such as memory function and ability to detect pain
8946354 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8946355 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain
8946356 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8946357 from the temple grounds barack obama will outline an agenda for america that includes raising taxes increasing spending putting government bureaucrats in charge of health care and isolating america from the benefits of the global economy
8946358 while barack obama will talk about his plans to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle class he will not say that his record includes voting for higher taxes 94 times and voting for a tax increase on those making just 42 000 per year
8946359 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8946360 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8946361 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8946362 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
8946363 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8946364 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8946365 talked loosely about the same old democratic solutions that have failed
8946366 there is a not too well known way to get some money from us well do it but dont popularize it
8946367 trabalhar aqui muito interessante eu conhe o muitos estrangeiros e converso com eles
8946368 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8946369 its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road
8946370 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8946371 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work

8946631 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8946632 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8946633 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8946634 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8946635 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8946646 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8946647 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

8946657 its a dramatic film about an alcoholic basketball coach and this girls high school basketball team
8946658 its kind of like bad news bears meets half nelson meets hoosiers
8946659 but at the center is this great character in preparation im learning about basketball and bobby knight
8946660 it seems bizarre but then west side story probably seemed bizarre at the time it was made
8946661 i am the all singing all dancing crap of this world
8946662 it might be the narrator coming back to the support groups
8946663 its a scene they didnt do in the movie where the character is unmasked and humiliated and the support group actually redeems and rescues the character
8946664 obviously we try and keep prices as low and competitive as possible and from time to time customers will see a drop
8946665 in recent months we have cut prices by 2 or 3p on a couple of occasions and we have run promotions in stores to help shoppers save money
8946666 sainsburys has been leading the way in terms of the benefits of a reduction in the price of oil being passed on to customers
8946667 within five minutes of that posting going up the responses were pouring in and they kept coming for weeks i got 300 applicants
8946668 there were the chefs people who had been in the restaurant business for years but felt somehow out of touch with food there were the cubicle people who made much more than 10 an hour but were up late at night looking on craigslist for a way out and there were the animal people who had more experience with cats and hamsters than goats but 95 of the applicants who wrote were really serious they were trying to make it work
8946669 theres a whole generation that sees farming as an option now not just a fun job for six weeks but as a career people want to come and learn and work for a while and then find a piece of property of their own
8946670 my mother operates a 7 11 in southern california shes on the opposite end of the food continuum finding employees is her biggest complaint she pays more than i do but she can never find anyone to work for her

8946683 if the latest poll numbers remain the same then such and such will happen in november

8946685 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8946686 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8946687 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8946688 this fight will have the whole world talking and will be a fantastic night for boxing oscars career has always been defined by taking on the biggest challenges and fighting best names in boxing this fight against a great champion like manny pacquiao is just another testament to his readiness to face the strongest competition and continue his legacy as one of the greatest fighters boxing has ever seen
8946689 this fight is what all sports fans are looking forward to a contest between two champions who come to fight and who are the most popular names in boxing today manny pacquiao is taking on a major task in facing the legendary oscar de la hoya but we at top rank are very confident manny will handle himself extremely well
8946690 mgm mirage has hosted the greatest names in sports and entertainment and this event will certainly continue that tradition we look forward to presenting one of the most exciting promotions in the history of boxing and there is no question this fight will have a major impact on fans worldwide
8946691 de la hoya pacquiao is a dream match up which will capture the imagination of sports fans everywhere its the pay per view king vs the pound for pound king and an event in which both fighters popularity clearly transcends the sport

8946699 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8946700 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8946701 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8946702 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8946703 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8946704 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8946705 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8946706 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8946707 let me use the final half hour before lunch to demonstrate how the same is true of heterosexism what society is wrestling with in coming to terms with the gay and lesbian minority is not really homophobia the nexus of negative attitudes towards them but heterosexism the maintenance by straight people of the system that awards them multiple automatic advantages

8946731 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8946732 the 2nd amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8946733 the speech by senator obama in front of an audience of nearly 80 000 people on a warm night in a football stadium refashioned into a vast political stage for television viewers left little doubt how he intended to press his campaign against mr mccain this fall
8946734 mr obama showed real fire and directed memorable fire at his opponent even on mr mccains signature issue national security
8946735 the occasion was part coronation part organizing meeting part woodstock
8946736 barack obamas speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination thursday night was what many nervous democrats were hoping for a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
8946737 in a speech filled with policy specifics and some of the toughest swipes he has taken at his opponent in the campaign obama took on the sharp criticisms the gop has leveled against him in recent months and at the same time exhorted the nation to look beyond politics as usual
8946738 the stagecraft of obamas speech the capstone to the four day democratic national convention lived up to its billing thousands of flashbulbs lighting up the warm denver night a sea of people waving americans flags and signs reading change obamas visage broadcast on giant video screens at invesco field but his boldly chosen setting also risked playing into republican criticism that his candidacy is too heavy on spectacle and too light on substance
8946739 on a night of drama expectation and excitement obama stood before 84 000 people and a tv audience of tens of millions around the world and launched his sharpest ever assault on opponent john mccain
8946740 decrying the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
8946741 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8946742 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and sen mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support sen obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8946743 the toughness seemed to signal an awareness that obama who maintains only the narrowest of leads in the polls had to make a stronger case against the republicans
8946744 in recent weeks as the novelty of obamas candidacy wore off it became clear that the urge for change in the country wasnt enough to carry him to victory obama left little unsaid last night and set the tone for a rugged general election campaign to come
8946745 when barack takes the stage tonight hell look out at delegates from every corner of the country and tens of thousands of ordinary people who are here to be part of this historic moment but in the very first row hell see a group of people who are there because they took ownership of the political process some gave just five dollars theyre folks just like you and they represent more than two million americans who own a piece of this campaign our success would not have been possible without so many people answering the call by giving whatever they can afford on this final day before barack formally accepts the democratic nomination please celebrate the moment and lay the foundation for our victory in november by making a donation of 25 or more now
8946746 all of it bottom line im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue
8946747 i put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8946748 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job given what has occurred and he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
8946749 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me and id say it shouldnt go any farther than that my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken and my job is obviously frustrating the hell out of me right now to be honest because i just believe were better than this
8946750 if i knew why i wouldve fixed it unfortunately its my job to put it together and then fix whats broke and obviously i have not been able to figure that out
8946751 i do know one thing this team is trying they are not laying down thats a fact they do care they want to win and for some reason its just not happening

8946762 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
8946763 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8946764 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8946765 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8946766 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8946767 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8946768 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time

8946789 if the president thought john mccain was going to be the next president he would think it more appropriate to let the next president make that decision than do it on his way out
8946790 i do wonder with senator obama if president bush thinks senator obamas going to win does he somehow think does he worry that obama wont follow through on that policy

8946794 preparations for an israeli military option intended to stop irans nuclear program are underway
8946795 the debate between those who believe in doing everything including a military operation to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb and those who think we can live with iranian nukes has been settled
8946796 if the ayatollahs regime does not fall in the next year if the americans do not strike militarily and if the international sanctions do not break the iranian nuclear plan israel will have to act forcefully
8946797 the americans have accepted the fact that iran will be a nuclear power and are trying to get us to accept it too
8946798 what a shame because ido will set it all on fire

8946813 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8946814 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8946815 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8946816 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8946817 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8946818 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8946819 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8946820 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8946821 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8946822 ive been waiting for this time for a long time but its not like we won a super bowl
8946823 i know my responsibilities to the nfl and im going to hold my own and do what i need to do to make sure i stay where i am right now which is reinstated
8946824 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8946825 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8946826 it is going to cost a lot of money to expand their business

8946834 it is unclear how the broadcasts of a radio station whose majority of listeners are civilians and majority of broadcasts are not purely military related are essential to martial efforts
8946835 broadcasting current events cultural and entertainment programs and interviews with officers does not contribute at all to israels security and conducting them on shabbat is not necessary in order to defend the country and maintain its army
8946836 galatzs non military programming is not subject to general staff orders
8946837 if it is a form of media there is no reason why young and talented people will enlist in it and contribute to the countrys security by reporting from the field for instance the knesset instead of doing their service in areas resembling tasks connected to israels security
8946838 the petitioners are not interested in silencing the station on shabbat or holidays these broadcasts can occur either by technical means allowing for automatic broadcasting without the use of soldiers or by means of people who are not soldiers

8946946 so its an interesting challenge to find ways to break them
8946947 which contain positively charged ions that can rip negatively charged fluoride ions from c f bonds but the reaction is difficult to sustain for long periods as the acid tends to become exhausted by reacting with other compounds

8946960 ive lived every boys dream playing afl football and the fremantle football clubs been fantastic for me so im wrapped
8946961 ive made it known to the football club id love to go around again but at the end of the day ive got to make sure i get a clearer picture in the next couple of days and find out
8946962 we found out a lot about our players particularly with regards to our depth and some of our younger players
8946963 weve been really competitive all year just a couple of things we need to tidy up and who knows whatll happen
8946964 a lot of it is the nature of what they do
8946965 they get in a lot of eight nine man fronts their safeties are very active they ask those guys to make plays and last year they did and thats why they were successful
8946966 very aggressive very fast theyve got some guys that can really rush the passer off the edge im really impressed with the way they run and pursue the football
8946967 they have big receivers that can run theyre always going to have exciting skill people theyre a talented team and theyve got some of the best and smartest coaches in the country so im sure theyll be well prepared

8946993 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8946994 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
8946995 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
8946996 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration

8947021 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
8947022 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8947023 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
8947024 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction

8947029 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8947030 the dwp needs to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring or if they need to give up work to care through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms
8947031 the current system is enormously complicated and even dwp staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8947032 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8947033 if the government is serious about reaching an 80 employment rate and empowering people to work it needs to look seriously at how it can remove the barriers that make it very difficult for carers especially those on means tested benefits to engage in the labour market
8947034 this includes 150m over two years so that carers can take short breaks over 6m to support young carers and up to 38m to help them to enter or re enter the job market
8947035 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8947036 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course
8947037 we argued for improvements to benefits as part of the governments carers strategy and were bitterly disappointed when none were included
8947038 as well as being insultingly low at just 50 55 per week carers allowance does not recognise carers individual circumstances and discourages them from combining caring with paid work the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8947039 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return
8947040 we are delighted that the committee has recognised the potential of care vouchers and we look forward to working with the government and the dwp to implement the committees recommendation
8947041 at the very least the reports conclusions and recommendations should be at the forefront of the current thinking thats going into the green papers on both welfare reform and on social care funding for adult services

8947043 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well
8947044 but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8947045 im surprised that teams that finished ninth richmond 10th 11th carlton and 12th essendon get so much credit yet the teams that finished fifth collingwood sixth adelaide seventh st kilda and eighth dont
8947046 i can tell you one thing i know for certain
8947047 we are going to have more chance of doing damage in the finals than carlton essendon richmond fremantle melbourne et cetera
8947048 if you look at the swans people said last year we were too old and too slow and this year we would really struggle and we wouldnt make the eight
8947049 as a club were very proud of our achievements this year
8947050 we have been able to maintain a very very high standard over the past six years
8947051 some teams havent but they seem to get credit for that
8947052 its a great achievement to play in finals despite what some people would lead you to believe
8947053 cada vez hay menos trabajadores que pagan el impuesto a las ganancias

8947057 de los 330 mil trabajadores alcanzados por el impuesto a las ganancias 310 mil tienen rebaja y en algunos casos esa rebaja es del 50 por ciento

8947059 uno puede ver la pel cula o la foto yo vengo en la pel cula y lo que veo es que paso a paso las cosas se van modificando y hoy la situaci n de los trabajadores que pagan ganancias es tremendamente diferente a la que viv a en el 2005

8947244 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests

8947246 boris was forced to go to beijing to collect the olympic flag
8947247 i would have told the international olympic committee to put it in the post
8947248 brian coleman is entitled to his views on the olympics which is a matter of taste and political opinion but it is preposterous to suggest that boris johnson was forced to go to beijing
8947249 he rejects absolutely any suggestion that britains athletes are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8947250 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team

8947305 these cuts are harmful to all artists but they really hurt our developing music industry
8947306 we have been working closely with music p e i and the east coast music association to increase market readiness for island performers and have relied on the federal programs for significant assistance in the export market if we have to re direct provincial cultural dollars to fill gaps left by federal cuts it will have an impact on our ability to help develop entry level artists
8947307 without the financial involvement of foreign affairs we would not have been able to create this opportunity
8947308 more dollars for national museums and activities in ottawa provides little benefit for the artists and people of prince edward island we need the resources directed to regional programs and to individuals who live and work here if we are to obtain the social and economic benefits which come from the arts
8947309 we would have been willing to work with ottawa to develop programs which address the cultural needs of our artists and i am disappointed that there has been no consultation with the provinces in regard to these cuts

8947334 to admit our doubt and confusion to whites to open up our psyches to general examination by those who had caused so much of the damage in the first place seemed ludicrous itself an expression of self hatred
8947335 it was obvious that certain whites could be exempted from the general category of our distrust

8947472 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5m a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement
8947473 f ulfilling americas promise will require more than just money it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programmes alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need

8947615 to go through what i went through in march when the charges were filed with the media circus and everything i went through i didnt want to put my family through all that the fact is im not denying the accident occurred but it would be very hard for a jury even though the circumstances are much different than what was reported it would be very difficult for them to find me not guilty given the way the law is written
8947616 what counts is how you play in the regular season thats what matters it doesnt mean that the individual performances and group performances and how you execute plays isnt important it is important and that leads to your execution at a later point in time but id say thats what you gain from preseason
8947617 im very strict about what i do to my photos
8947618 after several attempts at shooting the opera house from a moving ferry i decided to create a shot that would utilise the ferrys movement rather than trying to fight it by moving the camera along the ferrys path of travel you get this phantom like impression naturally and without post processing enhancement
8947619 having lived with the building for almost all of my life makes choosing a particular view impossible for me the building is the whole organism inside and out
8947620 this is the main reason for choosing the winning image it shows nothing it shows everything it is like an impressionist painting it lets your mind produce the images and fill in the gaps
8947621 the motif was depicted in so many beautiful and original ways that one could find a winner in many different categories however the winning shot shows the opera house in a subliminal way it shows the spirit of the building a parallel to the impressionistic sketches my father submitted for the opera house competition in 1957
8947622 it shows movement excitement vibrancy and an innovative approach he obviously gave it a lot of thought and did a great job
8947623 i just kept shooting and shooting and eventually i got a couple that stood out
8947624 actually it was quite frustrating because i was trying to get a nice depth shot and couldnt get it right so i thought ok ill try some blurry ones it was lucky that the distance of the ferry was just right it all workedperfectly
8947625 its very good for night shots as you can see from the image it really captures a lot of different shades of light
8947626 its a hobby i just love it im really happy to shoot whenever i get the chance
8947627 my approach was that the opera house has been shot so many times and so many professionals will do it perfectly that im going to have to do something to make it happen tweaking it or making it blurred there was a lot of luck involved
8947628 as expected the pace of economic activity remains slow as a result of the u s slowdown and its impact on our export sector
8947629 for 2008 as a whole i expect real gdp to increase by about 1 percent
8947630 solid growth in income and employment in the second quarter should help support economic activity going forward
8947631 i am comfortable on the revenue side that we are on track i am comfortable that we are on track for the rest of the year
8947632 but as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp

8947645 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day

8947680 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8947681 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8947682 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8947683 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8947684 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8947685 i just think its unbelievable because i really did not think in my lifetime that i would ever see this happen it just means so much for african americans
8947686 you have not seen this much energy and people getting involved in something positive since kennedy
8947687 people that never thought about voting are this time going to vote
8947688 we raise children saying to them you can be anything you want to be including the president of the united states and never before has it been a reality for my minority students
8947689 absolutely believes that people in this country are ready for an african american president
8947690 obama did not get where he is today off of the african american vote and i think that speaks volumes
8947691 not because hes a black man but because hes a good man
8947692 let martin luther kings dream be true that we arent judging anyone by the color of their skin but let us judge them by their character
8947693 some of my best friends are white men but theyre not the only ones who can lead there are good brains in asians in latinos in women
8947694 we want this to happen with every limb in my body and every thought in my mind trusting that this is possible thats how badly we want it
8947695 i just want him to give the speech of his lifetime
8947696 i personally want him to do a great job so that people believe what he says
8947697 i have no doubt in my mind that he will go down as one of the greatest presidents who ever lived and thats what i want to see happen
8947698 but i truly believe what hes saying so i hope he does what he says he can do
8947699 i mean black people we couldnt vote and now we have a black man running for president thats like crazy youd never think that nothing like that could ever happen
8947700 being raised in shreveport la the democratic party was a party of jim crow and segregation it was a party of strictly white and anti civil rights
8947701 in my time black people were republican because it was the party of lincoln that freed us
8947702 as much of a chance as any other person thats ever run for president

8947711 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8947712 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8947713 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8947714 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8947715 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter
8947716 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8947717 i just told him today youre the love of my life
8947718 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8947719 i didnt ever want to regret not ever dating anybody else because nick was you know he was the love of my life the you know the first guy that i really fell like head over heels i want to marry this guy you know i never really dated at all
8947720 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8947721 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second

8947724 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8947725 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8947726 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8947727 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8947728 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor

8947730 what draws me to them aside from the fact that theyre a huge lot of fun i dont know
8947731 but i know that when i used to see action movies there was this charge that i would get and it would be like recharging my batteries
8947732 i would come out the theatre either doing whatever fight moves were in there or fantasising about whatever cool scene so i do them i guess for the fan of action movies that i am
8947733 i was talking to my father and i said dad after babylon should i do another action movie or go back the other direction and a drama
8947734 no not really because when i got the part i was playing henry v which has a similar sort of iconography within the theatre canon
8947735 i thought this was just a natural progression in a sense because he has had some wonderful actors playing him in the past but i wasnt too worried about that and i just figured providing i stuck to the script and did what i could to the best of my ability things would be fine
8947736 i was most excited on my mothers behalf as well because she had always been a big fan of colin firths rendition of the character and i was more pleased to be able to tell her i wont die in this and also im playing a guy that you kind of dig quite a lot
8947737 obviously being my mother that had a different spin on this time but that was one of the pleasures of taking the role

8947743 ayerss spectacular second act began when he enrolled at columbia universitys teachers college in 1984
8947744 there are vast dislocations in industrial towns erosions of trade unions there is little sign of class consciousness today
8947745 our great cities are burnished on the surfaces building high technologies displaying astonishing consumer goods and on the side streets in the crevices in the burnt out neighborhoods there are the rootless the dependent the sick the permanently unemployed there is little sense of agency even among the brightly successful there is little capacity to look at things as if they could be otherwise
8947746 homelessness as a consequence of the private dealings of landlords an arms buildup as a consequence of corporate decisions racial exclusion as a consequence of a private choice
8947747 homelessness crime racism oppression we have the resources and knowledge to fight and overcome these things
8947748 we need to look beyond our isolated situations to define our problems globally we cannot be child advocates in chicago or new york and ignore the web that links us with the children of india or palestine
8947749 in a truly just society there would be a greater sharing of the burden a fairer distribution of material and human resources

8947757 tell you what take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble
8947758 there are two other boys like him in our community all three are in very poor circumstances jim just loves to bargain with them for peas apples tomatoes or whatever when they come back with their red marbles and they always do he decides he doesnt like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one when they come on their next trip to the store
8947759 those three young men who just left were the boys i told you about they just told me how they appreciated the things jim traded them now at last when jim could not change his mind about color or size they came to pay their debt weve never had a great deal of the wealth of this world

8947782 id love to find something to criticize about it you got anything
8947783 it is analysis that strikes me as having born no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched none whatsoever and for it to be distributed by the lone national news organization in terms of wire copy to newspapers around the country and web sites is a remarkable failure of that news organization charles babington find a new line of work
8947784 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8947785 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8947786 were big fans of gamesindustry biz by some measure its the best games trade site out there and im including the us ones too its a true must read site and several times a day at that the team have done a great job building it to such a position of strength
8947787 historians and the press have dropped the ball on architects and their value and importance to the life of the state
8947788 i think of architecture as more significant than painting and sculpting because it has the potential to reach more people in a much more public way i wanted to pay respect to one of the great designers of the space we inhabit
8947789 what made him exceptional was that he was a guy with a 6th grade education who graduated from carpentry building and contracting to architecture without any licensure or professional training
8947790 their entire pattern and design style owes a tremendous debt to gibson he built the first five buildings and he established an architectural style and language one that still continues
8947791 missoula was still a pretty rough place it had a few bad fires because the architecture was wood most of the city was made up of wood frames and log buildings there were very few brick and stone buildings
8947792 at that time 1880s 1890s missoula was a fully functioning town but it still had much of the character of your typical western town the mud streets wooden sidewalks bars and bordellos everywhere by the time a j gibson left there was electricity street cars automobiles paved roads sidewalks it was a different place
8947793 gibson decided to build a downtown office at the northeastern corner of higgins and broadway called cedar street it was to be the most important intersection of downtown missoula and it still is it had office spaces rentable space a general store and some boarding rooms he gambled on that location and it turned out to be a smart choice it gave him a front row seat
8947794 was that there were so many competing lists about what he had actually done and so much wrong information out there
8947795 we now know that there were at least 144 designs if not as many buildings thats amazing for a person who practiced architecture for just 20 years the drawings at the k ross toole archives are the definitive argument that there were more buildings designed here by gibson than at first thought his opus has expanded greatly this is as close to a definitive list as we can get right now the list is bound to change as people see more of gibsons documents and descriptions
8947796 it was quite ugly from the start there were accusations that damaged his reputation and there were issues with the execution of the building he had major problems with the materials eventually another supervisor was hired to complete the project which must have been demeaning for gibson
8947797 the project came in very late if you go to the courthouse today youll see 1908 over the doorway but the building actually opened its doors in 1910 in 1909 with the project in the middle of operation gibson retired
8947798 when he died in 1927 there was a clear knowledge that he was a brilliant important figure in the development of architecture and urbanism in the western part of the state but gibson didnt create a distinctive style or receive formal training as an architect so hes been on the outside
8947799 ive always had an interest for artists who are at the margins of movements
8947800 the people on the edges of movements figures like gibson interest me because they have certain freedoms that those who have been academically trained do not they see opportunities the pack doesnt often see
8947801 i want to see these buildings acknowledged celebrated and preserved as our legacy for the next generation
8947802 to help do so is my way of giving back to missoula its my way of giving the city back its own history
8947803 the game industry in japan is standing at a critical juncture whether it continues to be a center of the video game industry in the world or not tecmo is a group of excellent creators with proven track record in the global market which is a precious human resource of japan
8947804 we however cannot be optimistic about the future of this significant resource given the current circumstances surrounding tecmo we believe that tecmo will be able to make a great leap forward by joining the square enix group
8947805 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters

8947833 i have no first hand information on why this transaction has not been completed and why the company stayed independent to be sold to microsoft only a little over 2 months later at a price increased by 60 million i can imagine microsoft advisors noticed the announcement of the deal and came up with a higher price once they saw a value in this shopping related search for the redmond based corporation this is nothing but a guess of mine but it may show that it is wise to announce all the planned acquisitions as loud as possible to get a chance of receiving a higher bid

8947865 avevano dormito nel nostro bed and breakfast una sola notte nel settembre del 2007 in quelloccasione friedrich li aveva conosciuti ha aggiunto il 17 marzo si trovavano a roma per assistere al derby tra i giallorossi e la lazio molto probabilmente erano rimasti in contatto con mio figlio e quella sera si erano incontrati a san lorenzo in un pub
8947866 mi sento colpevole di aver convinto mio figlio alla confessione nonostante il fatto che lui non si ricordasse nulla di quanto era accaduto perch al momento dellincidente era ubriaco ha detto roberto vernarelli i giudici devono fare il loro lavoro e accertare tutti questi dubbi io ribadisco se stato mio figlio giusto che paghi ma la verit va accertata fino in fondo costringero i magistrato a cercare i due cittadini ungheresi
8947867 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
8947868 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
8947869 i wanted to be there to help however i could
8947870 whoever might have picked him up might not know hes a missing person

8947873 i am looking at the baby right now and i see perfection
8947874 after a few years my husband was working in a manufacturing plant and hating it i was helping other farmers make a profitable living and wondering why i shouldnt be applying this same information to my own farm
8947875 we wanted our children to grow up in a similar environment that i had growing up on the farm and we wanted to find a way to keep the farm thats been in our family for over 100 years in production thats hard to do with a dairy farm
8947876 we spend a lot of time with the customers to whom we sold produce the previous year we want to know what crops were most profitable to them how much of each crop they hope to sell the following year based on that input we plan how many acres of each crop we will plant during the growing season
8947877 everybody wants a piece of the pie with organics the outrageous input prices that conventional growers have are even higher for organic producers
8947878 a combination of compost and manure provides at least half our fertilizer which cuts our cost some but spreading costs thanks to high diesel prices offsets some of the advantages from dairy
8947879 most of my brothers and sisters live in the area and work with us on the farm when we need them its been a good thing
8947880 over a year ago we thought about closing this facility i wanted facilities opened and serving the public or closed completely and sold
8947881 we are re opening this facility and we are moving forward
8947882 if you had not stepped up as a community for this facility a year ago we would not be open today
8947883 you said you needed this facility and we are here to help you be successful we work for you we are your public servants
8947884 we cant afford to try a lot of things with seeds and chemicals we would come here and check on the experiments and learn what to use on our farms
8947885 i want this to get back to a way of life for us
8947886 back to depending on this station like i know we can
8947887 we have a specific problem we can only study here
8947888 we are working on a new management strategy for georgia there is no other place this could take place

8947912 the most important thing is that the talks are going on
8947913 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8947914 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
8947915 i will be guided by what they want right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side
8947916 i know this business very well ive been doing it for 20 years and im very focused on the australian and new zealand businesses
8947917 we had new auditors this year and consequently again its just making sure we tick every box now especially with this increased scrutiny
8947918 the parents are still paying fees and the government still pays a fair portion so its a good operation
8947919 last year new crop cottonseed was running about 155 per ton in late july this year it was 310
8947920 weve seen a significant loss of tonnage as seed per bale at gins has dropped from 800 pounds to 700 pounds or less this particularly hurts when cottonseed prices are as high as they are now for 25 000 bales ginned the dollar impact is some 375 000
8947921 try and get cottonseed companies to breed back some additional seed size and weight into their varieties
8947922 and some dairies have taken cottonseed out of their rations
8947923 most dairies seem to be handling higher feed costs fairly well with higher prices for milk offsetting the increases some of the more highly leveraged operations may see trouble though
8947924 were getting requests for quotes on thousands of tons for overseas shipments but not much business has materialized because of shortage of supply and high transportation costs
8947925 we hope the higher prices for cottonseed will influence the planting of more cotton as producers and ginners look at the total value of cotton and not just the fiber
8947926 if you dont comply with these very complex regulations you could face some serious problems
8947927 you need to be very careful who has your wallet and check writing authority because you can be held responsible
8947928 significant fines with criminal sanctions likely after the first violation
8947929 the conference will give farmers and community planners the opportunity to come together and discuss the many ways to preserve farmland for our future generations
8947930 in addition to farm estate planning the conference will also provide information on things farmers can do today to improve their profitability and viability such as cost share assistance through the tennessee agricultural enhancement program
8947931 the family farm and agriculture is the most important industry for the state of tennessee and the country
8947932 i think it is important for farmers to know what their options are for preserving their farms and their legacy

8947946 all of them would change the dynamic of football and im not in favour of changing the game dramatically
8947947 over the years ive moved from being completely against technology to being completely for it and now im somewhere in between
8947948 obviously the referee wants to be seen as having the perfect game and if technology was developed to do that we would be delighted
8947949 but equally the game is the game because of the way it is played and the nature of football being a dynamic sport
8947950 someone suggested that maybe we should do something like tennis where each club has the opportunity to challenge an incident one or two times during a match
8947951 obviously the tv coverage and the media coverage is great at any old firm game
8947952 but when we start the match our focus is on making sure the game passes off without incident
8947953 its crucial that our teamwork is as good as the players teamwork its very much a team game
8947954 i understand that passions run high in the top fixtures
8947955 the players have obviously got a great focus on winning the match ive got a great focus on making sure whoever wins does so in a fair manner and i want the match to pass off without incident or controversy
8947956 the most important thing is that the talks are going on
8947957 australia really knows how to do big sports events weve all watched with great admiration as theyve staged international events such as sydney 2000 that are recognised as among the very best
8947958 with 2012 now on the horizon we thought it timely for the uk and australia to network as the big build begins for the london games and beijing is the perfect place to showcase our expertise
8947959 the most important thing is that the talks are going on
8947960 turned into a national embarrassment and a symbol of piggish pork barrel spending
8947961 the goal of our recapitalisation effort is to reduce debt levels and extend remaining debt maturities through asset sales and new equity investment
8947962 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8947963 its a good operating company and should get itself out of this capitalisation issue
8947964 the most important thing is that the talks are going on
8947965 the tweenies have those unique qualities which cross generations of young children and next year is all about cementing their position as a classic brand for pre schoolers and building a platform for our licensing partners
8947966 we would love to hear from licensees and retailers to discuss the opportunities the 10th anniversary celebrations will provide for 2009 and beyond
8947967 this is a out of the ball park grand slam
8947968 obama is weakest among women 35 to 50 and she will appeal to that voter block very well this is a classical mccain decision and why this choice is so good this is bold fresh and it clearly indicates that mccain is the agent of change but who also has the experience that obama does not have i have long felt that this race is about wisdom judgement and leadership this decision reinforces those themes
8947969 now this is just wrong i think why would you need video on a dslr im pretty disappointed about this i was afraid that this would be the next step from live view i hope canon will not include this video feature in their dslrs
8947970 im conflicted about the video kinda like the pop up flash once you get into advanced amateur or pro its just not a good feature or is it
8947971 i believe the feeling is if my 100 00 10mp p amp s can take movies than how come my 1300 00 dslr cant granted you dont have to use it if you dont want to i think nikon is just thinking ahead and trying to grab more marketshare
8947972 the fact that they added video to this body caught my eye itd be sweet to utilize the different lenses to make videos wide apertures manual focus different angles man itd be much more dynamic than point amp shoot recording

8947986 nosotros hemos conversado con m s de cien empresarios de los grupos que est n aqu para llegar a estos acuerdos
8947987 nosotros a nivel de di logos abiertos con el sector productivo hemos llegado a unos acuerdos de estabilizaci n de precios muy importantes y adem s el sector productivo de este pa s y es muy importante recalcar ha hecho esfuerzos inmensos esfuerzos para crear productos especiales para los quintiles uno dos y tres
8947988 nunca ni la asociaci n de canales ni aer de pichincha han desconocido la potestad que podr a tener el estado en poner campa as educativas eso est claramente expuesto en el art culo 81 de la constituci n vigente es decir la constituci n del 98 una hora diaria y tambi n el art culo 59 de la ley de radio y televisi n pero esa hora diaria est determinada exactamente para que y habla de que tiene que ser para educaci n y salud
8947989 el ministerio de educaci n que es la entidad que deber a producir esto nunca ha tenido material en este sentido pero lo que nosotros objetamos es que hay que leer estos art culos en su contexto es decir es una campa a educativa las campa as educativas son dirigidas al activo fundamental de la educaci n que son los ni os y son los j venes
8947990 y que adicionalmente al estar dentro de un proceso electoral estamos regidos por una ley org nica especial que es la de control de gasto electoral y la m xima autoridad es la autoridad electoral
8947991 nos parece bastante extra o que justamente cuando nunca se ha hecho nada en a o y medio ni en los otros gobiernos se ha hecho ahora se pretenda hacer un programa al que se le dice educativo y que se va a poner los textos constitucionales
8947992 no hay que olvidarse adem s que los representantes legales de los medios de comunicaci n de acuerdo a la ley org nica del control del gasto tienen responsabilidad ulterior esto quiere decir que incluso podr an ser sancionados hasta penalmente bajo esas condiciones lo que nosotros estamos diciendo es se ores nosotros queremos examinar los programas y no es que vamos a censuar porque no estamos diciendo que no los pueden transmitir pero una vez que veamos los programas entonces se ver si se enmarca dentro del art culo 81 de la constituci n o si es que corresponde a otro tipo de programa y por lo tanto se proceder a de acuerdo a lo que dice la ley en ese sentido

8948004 on a broader level when you look at the different people in fleetwood mac the key thing right now for us is to dignify how we got started and the road we have left to go to make sure that its done in a way which is fundamentally supportive of each other and acknowledging of the love we have for each other now

8948228 the vp debate is going to be so fun to watch a six term us senator versus someone who has spent the majority of her political career on the city council of a town of less than 10 000 people

8948237 i see no way how we can attract foreign investment without foreign investment malaysia cant propel its economy and unfortunately this is not addressed
8948238 endemic corruption the tenders awarded to cronies and their families failure to cut cost and be more efficient

8948285 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
8948286 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre

8948300 he has to change his style a little and scott can fight if you back him into a corner he can fight
8948301 you could hardly get a bigger top of the bill than the ruiz and valuev fight so its a big step for scott maybe as big as the danny williams fight
8948302 if he was to pull this off theres so many opportunities out there now

8948324 the muslim brotherhood is a group that worries us not because it deals with philosophical or ideological ideas but because it defends the use of violence against civilians
8948325 beginnings of all of the religious terrorism that we are witnessing today were in the muslim brotherhoods ideology

8948328 we are taught from our abba himself what is right and what is wrong its a discernment that he grants us a wisdom to all those who seek it he grants it our vision becomes clear as a bell we develop a clarity that evaporates fuzziness about whats right and whats wrong we know it in our heart our mind our very soul our soul cries out grieves at wrong mourns when wrong wins and leaves a trail of wounded suffering cast aside devastated bleeding souls it mourns even moreso when innocence is taken stolen bought silenced as the travesty continues predatorily seeking more souls to lay waste to it mourns the injustice done to those who cannot speak for themselves we decide each moment that we breathe who we cheer for what we cheer for we either stand up for right or we stand up for wrong its simple we have a guide if we are listening we have a guide

8948331 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8948332 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8948333 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8948336 our customers demand rugged solutions that perform in extreme environments core systems sales engineers and engineering staff work closely with our customer to bridge the hardware engineering gap which is somewhat unique in our industry
8948337 the change we have seen over the past hundred years will be nothing compared with what we will see over the next twenty
8948338 this is an extraordinary time to be alive i feel really fortunate to be going to be a fascinating time in history
8948339 i dont think there is anything to be gained by throwing up our hands and saying that everything is finished
8948340 human beings are incredibly creative and adaptive and there is nothing that indicates that the creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of this peak is going to completely evaporate when we have to start designing our way down the other side
8948341 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
8948342 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
8948343 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way

8948346 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
8948347 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
8948348 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
8948349 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8948350 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8948351 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8948352 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8948353 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8948354 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8948355 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8948356 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
8948357 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

8948368 right now we have a five oclock grand final which clearly is a compromise
8948369 obviously its a balance between trying to unashamedly achieve high tv ratings while also looking at the game as a spectacle
8948370 and in brisbane the match will still be kicking off by four oclock anyway which is fairly close to the traditional start
8948371 so even though theres no doubt it disrupts the club competition wednesday night origins work for a range of reasons
8948372 while stand alone weekends mean theyre free of any club footy while players also lose those 10 days of preparation they currently enjoy
8948373 and i reckon the fans are 100 per cent right
8948374 were not going to buy players for the sake of it but between now and the new year we believe the right name or names will become available
8948375 thats just the nature of rugby league whod have thought our former forward willie mason would go on the market last november
8948376 were very happy with the calibre of our signings to date and it gave us a lot of satisfaction to see brett kimmorley cronulla and michael ennis broncos get man of the match awards last weekend while josh morris st george illawarra scored two tries
8948377 with ben hannant and michael hodgson coming well look forward to having plenty of depth in the front row but just as important is the fact these are high calibre people both on and off the field
8948378 it will be a very emotional day with coach steve folkes to be farewelled by the fans
8948379 he has been an ornament to the game as a player and coach
8948380 the boys have prepared well and they know a win will probably see us avoid the wooden spoon

8948396 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8948397 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8948398 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body

8948403 while organic growth remains strong in food ingredients usa and nutritionals the performance of food ingredients ireland in the second half will be reduced relative to the second half of 2007 as global dairy market volatility has created a time lag in balancing input costs and market returns
8948404 global dairy markets went to a spike in pricing in 2007 have come off that and come back to more normalised pricing which is still above the average of previous periods
8948405 revenues profits and margins increased for nutritionals with this business achieving good organic growth nutritionals also benefited from its innovation programme which is delivering products and solutions into the sports nutrition health and wellness and weight management sectors in the usa europe and asia

8948410 unfortunately map only goes so far in telling you what was actually behind the expenditures
8948411 often the spending record data will dead end at professional services supplies or non contract purchases while its possible that some of these purchases are fairly innocuous the name of the vendor alone gives reason for taxpayers to at least question the expense the next step for map should be posting line item information from purchase receipts on the spending portal taxpayers need to see exactly how those funds were spent
8948412 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8948413 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8948414 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8948415 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8948416 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8948417 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8948418 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8948419 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

8948426 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

8948455 the story is very pessimistic it has a dark and gloomy texture that japanese movie fans do not find appealing in a comic hero film japanese movie fans expect such films to be fun and action packed for the hero to be attractive for the villain to be loud and outrageous and for the movie itself to be easy to understand and light

8948460 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8948461 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8948462 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8948463 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8948464 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8948465 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8948466 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8948467 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8948469 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8948470 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8948471 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8948472 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8948473 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8948474 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8948475 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8948476 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8948477 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8948478 who are open to doing something on the production side
8948479 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8948480 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8948481 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8948482 as i have loved you that you also love one another
8948483 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8948484 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8948485 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8948486 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8948487 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8948488 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8948489 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8948490 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8948491 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8948492 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8948493 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8948554 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8948555 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8948556 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8948557 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them

8948561 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8948562 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8948563 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8948564 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8948565 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8948566 scusa se ti smonto cos ma non sei terribile come pensi a dirla tutta non ti trovo

8948574 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8948575 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8948576 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8948577 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8948578 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8948579 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8948659 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8948660 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8948661 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8948662 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8948663 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8948675 all american is the type of horse that just seems to keep on coming in his races he doesnt give up
8948676 the day he won at randwick skyline stakes he was out the back and unsuited by a slow tempo then forced wide on the turn
8948677 he wasnt entitled to win but somehow he found a way
8948678 even in the golden slipper he had to circle the field from near last and it was just about the run of the race
8948679 david hayes told me hes set all american for the golden rose and is very keen on the horses chances
8948680 he settled really well the other day and then let go with a brilliant turn of foot everything went perfect with him

8948682 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same theyre both very very aggressive with iran so i would say theres no difference
8948683 how would you handle these global threats then if its not to send our troops there and make sure that were protected
8948684 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises

8948709 but i think there might be a little jealousy there
8948710 i mean success breeds that so does the fact that when it comes to bidding wars for the games bigger names we usually get our man
8948711 im sure that ticks people off it certainly goes against the whole thing of cheering for the underdog

8948840 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8948841 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8948842 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8948843 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8948844 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8948909 every year madagascar imports about 200 000 tonnes of rice for consumption this year the gap is estimated at 270 000 tonnes and that will present a challenge
8948910 importing rice at international prices means paying 70 percent more than current local prices and that isnt expected to change
8948911 madagascar stands to benefit as a major exporter to the indian ocean islands of comoros seychelles and mauritius for example countries in eastern and southern africa could be another major export market
8948912 malnourishment in madagascar is aggravated by peoples dependence on just one food rice which provides calories but not many nutrients or protein
8948913 this is the first significant sorghum harvest the south has had in nearly 20 years

8948915 have political moves disturbed human rights efforts the answer is yes i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations

8948924 obamas no 1 ranking is akin to being declared the major league batting champion the honor goes to the player with the highest batting average regardless of whether he has the most hits
8948925 its true that those senators are generally perceived as being more liberal than obama but our ratings are based on actual votes not perceptions just because someone is perceived as a liberal doesnt mean he or she votes the liberal position every time
8948926 in the end the debate over whether obama was the most liberal senator last year doesnt strike me as particularly useful if obama had voted differently a couple of times or if we had added or subtracted a couple of other votes in our ratings he might not have been ranked as the most liberal senator in his first two years in the senate he was ranked as the 16th and 10th most liberal senator but by virtually any measure he still would have had a solidly liberal voting record

8949057 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8949058 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8949059 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out

8949108 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8949109 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8949110 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8949111 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8949112 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8949113 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8949114 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8949115 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8949116 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8949117 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8949118 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8949119 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8949120 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

8949122 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8949125 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8949126 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8949127 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8949128 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8949129 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8949132 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8949133 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8949134 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8949135 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8949136 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8949137 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8949138 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8949139 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8949140 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8949141 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8949142 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8949143 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8949144 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8949145 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8949146 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8949147 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8949148 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8949149 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8949150 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8949151 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8949152 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8949153 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8949154 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8949155 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8949156 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8949157 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8949158 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8949159 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8949160 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8949161 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8949162 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8949163 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8949164 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8949385 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8949386 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8949387 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present

8949389 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8949390 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8949391 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer

8949476 obamas speech was more substance than style more specifics than rhetorical flourish
8949477 in its depth and detail his speech resembled a state of the union address more than a typical stump speech

8949480 well obama said mccain wont go to the cave where osama is hiding boy john mccain isnt going to like that
8949481 weve nominated a guy who ran the whole fucking primary campaign without specifics
8949482 even if obama had talked for three hours of course he could not have detailed enough proposals to quiet all his critics but thats not the strategy as arizona gov janet napolitano said what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that she said republicans will criticize him no matter what
8949483 the piece is 603 words so we are to believe that babington watched the speech gave it due consideration wrote it turned it in had it go through editing had it go through copyediting and had it posted online all in 26 minutes
8949484 he said he would cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families but did not say how

8949490 corn at 6 35 per bushel local price in dickinson on aug 20 equates to approximately 14 cents per pound of total digestible nutrients tdn hay at 100 per ton to be delivered at approximately 15 per bale roughly a 150 mile delivery is priced at roughly 13 cents per pound of tdn
8949491 hay was still cheaper but in the long haul after waste is figured in that may or may not be true
8949492 i can limit feed corn with minimal waste while storing and feeding round bales of hay one should factor in to the price approximately 10 percent waste
8949493 what would corn cost if we looked at the source and moved it in unit volumes

8949575 this morning went quite well even though giedo has a big gap
8949576 i had a starter motor failure on thursday and this afternoon i spun at turn five which affected the grip of the tyres afterwards even so i hope to be able to make some big progress in the championship this weekend
8949577 i also need to start at the front because the first corner is so tight i remember last year having a touch with teammate alvaro parente
8949578 but we had some bad luck in the afternoon with all of the interruptions the red flag when ktrs siso cunill stopped out on track meant i only went out in the final ten minutes and then there were yellow flags so i couldnt get my tyres and brakes up to temperature
8949579 i am really happy with the way things went this afternoon because this morning things didnt go quite right at the start and the bike didnt work so well
8949580 we then changed to the new chassis and it was better straight away
8949581 we made sure we set it up the best we could and i am really happy with how it worked the team is working really hard and we have never lost our way today and this is important because after the great weekend we had in brno we need to continue with that kind of performance
8949582 i am sure we will all improve tomorrow and in the race and that we can carry on the great run the team is having
8949583 the bike worked pretty good straight out of the crate and some of the new parts we tested at brno worked well here
8949584 i am really happy with the way suzuki has worked to make the bike more competitive and it feels like we have taken a big step forward today
8949585 weve changed some things to get the tyres working well with new frame and that is all now coming together
8949586 we had a good test after brno and now here today i feel that the tyres are much better at this track than they were there so i am feeling even more confident
8949587 i dont want to make any predictions about the race or talk about results first of all we have to wait until tomorrow to see if we can continue like this
8949588 i think i can improve even more because everything feels better than two weeks ago so tomorrow we will try to keep going in this way

8949728 all of them would change the dynamic of football and im not in favour of changing the game dramatically
8949729 over the years ive moved from being completely against technology to being completely for it and now im somewhere in between
8949730 obviously the referee wants to be seen as having the perfect game and if technology was developed to do that we would be delighted

8949745 in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page
8949746 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row

8949751 pero juan carlos no le hizo caso y sali rumbo al micro con los chicos entonces este hombre lo invit a pelear en una placita que hab a enfrente como l no le hizo caso llam a un grupo de no menos de 25 chicos de las inferiores del club local que estaban all munidos de ca os palos y cadenas quienes lo encerraron en una calle lateral estrecha y empezaron a golpearlo
8949752 yo me qued paralizada porque los pibes que no ten an m s de 14 o 15 a os le pegaban brutalmente a mi esposo mientras este hombre los arengaba en un momento pens que lo mataban porque la gente de rivadavia que hab a acompa ado a los equipos tard en darse cuenta de la situaci n e intervenir

8949774 also the company is overweight in nsw and had a greater exposure to household expenditure at a time when the nsw economy was slowing
8949775 the fact that the company managed to hold its franchise margins was a good outcome
