6380001 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6380002 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6380010 the market is fearing that inflation may cross 13 14 per cent and that is the reason why it is correcting itself plus weak global cues and f amp o internals have also added to the trading pressure
6380011 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6380012 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6380013 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6380014 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6380015 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6380016 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6380017 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6380018 who are open to doing something on the production side
6380019 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6380020 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6380021 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6380022 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6380023 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6380024 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6380025 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6380026 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6380027 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6380028 the fastest man on the planet and he has rocked the games
6380029 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6380030 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6380031 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6380032 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6380033 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6380034 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6380035 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6380036 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6380037 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6380038 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6380039 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6380040 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6380041 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6380042 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6380043 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6380044 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6380045 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6380046 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6380047 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6380048 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6380077 but the truth is they never make much difference to me nothing a review has said has ever changed what i write and nor should it for any serious artist
6380078 i just try to think about what i can learn from them
6380079 with a little help from his friends in a night of madness
6380080 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6380081 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6380082 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6380083 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6380089 i think it was 10 9 in a four nations semi final and 23 20 in the european union semi final in dublin
6380090 but i gave away 14 points too didnt want to do that in this one
6380091 so the tactics were perfect tie in the fella close him down and he played straight into my hands soon as the bell went he came straight at me it was perfect because im pretty strong in the zone
6380092 if anyone steps in and trades with me theres probably only going to be one winner
6380093 last time he fought degale he boxed him and degale was expecting a fight but darren boxed him hes well capable of doing both
6380094 i had no life so i started to question what i was doing because all my eggs were in one basket
6380095 i was in with secondary school children some who hadnt even done transition year so they were only fifteen and i had to wear the uniform ive only one picture that my mom took and i wouldnt let her take it anywhere
6380096 after being in hospital and not thinking that i would see properly again this is childs play
6380097 and he was the perfect guy my supposed nemesis but i didnt fear him
6380098 because it was redemption the world championship was a low point for me and probably for irish boxing at the time we underperformed and everyone was writing us off writing off the high performance
6380099 i keep telling myself its not true im waiting by the phone for someone to call and tell me its all a bad dream and that hes coming home
6380100 we were happy as larry together i cant believe hes gone
6380101 they were fixing the place up so there would be a runway to allow horses access to a stream for drinking water when it happened they got a pretty bad beating pat managed to get john into the car and they drove up to the house
6380102 i was just hanging a blanket out on the line when i heard the car coming into the yard and them shouting for me they were covered in blood
6380103 pat said there were three of them and that they were beaten with a mallet handle john had a cut on the back of his head and on his left leg his hands and arms were all swollen and he was struck on the back as well pats arm was bleeding badly
6380104 the last i saw of john was when they put him in the ambulance he could hardly talk but he said i feel sick and i feel im going to pass out

6380111 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war in iraq that had nothing to do with 9 11
6380112 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6380113 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6380114 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography
6380115 thats what people think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bushs been doing for the last eight years
6380116 i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6380117 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i am questioning his patriotism
6380118 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6380119 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6380120 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country

6380130 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6380131 i dont have any need to show that im different than president bush
6380132 first thing id do as president is to go to see the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate i assume that that would be sen reid i hope not but i think thats probably the reality of this election and i would say lets have an agenda lets work together we know what the solutions are and we know what the options are social security on restraining spending on medicare on all of these energy independence on all of these issues
6380133 lets show the american people that there are opportunities for us to work together for the good of the country
6380134 and i think that they would benefit as much or more as i would
6380135 im not being elected dictator im being elected president and you have to work with congress and they know the priorities as well as i do
6380136 deep blue one party cities cities that have been deep blue for decades and generations all i see is poverty and despair

6380138 t he quality of a society is lowered morally and intellectually by the artificial preservation of those who are least able to take care of themselves
6380139 the democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not
6380140 we expect to play a role in the news coverage
6380141 but were not so ambitious as not to recognize that the focus of media attention will be on barack obama and the democratic convention
6380142 you cant win the week during the other partys convention so there is no reason to try
6380143 there are a lot of issues that will be discussed at the democratic convention and there are also a number of contrasts on this campaign that can be made
6380144 sending a gaggle of congressmen or former cabinet secretaries to hang outside the other partys convention might get you 4 to 5 seconds on the local news but not much more then that
6380145 the key is to turn the page as quickly as possible after the other side finishes
6380146 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6380147 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
6380148 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city

6380171 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6380172 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6380173 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6380174 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6380175 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6380176 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6380177 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6380178 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6380179 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6380180 aside from continued food assistance what we really need are sleeping mats mosquito nets and blankets
6380181 it is not just about a person hit by a bullet but those deprived of their education because schools have been disrupted by the fighting conflict makes people suffer
6380182 we are building water reservoirs and distributing hygiene kits aside from mattresses and mosquito nets
6380183 we bought the tent at the market so the children and our belongings would not get wet when there would be rain my husband would sleep outside our covered cart because it could not longer accommodate him
6380184 we are in a pitiful state we really want to go home but we are afraid because the situation is still dangerous
6380185 our four hectare farm of corn and coconuts is waiting but our village is a hot spot we are still afraid to go home
6380186 how i wish peace will reign in our midst we are tired of being displaced
6380187 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
6380188 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories

6380191 mereka memerlukan untuk datang penting untuk datang ke acara mantu bu ayin karena bersahabat nggak enak kalau nggak datang
6380192 sunt intarzieri temporare in procesarea proiectelor de dezvoltare a resurselor umane
6380193 am cerut directorului general al apdrp sa ia de urgenta cateva masuri de ameliorare a functionarii directiei de control antifrauda din cadrul agentiei care in opinia mea impreuna cu directia de audit ar fi trebui sa se autosesizeze si sa nu asteptam un audit al ce pentru a clarifica anumite aspecte ce trebuiau clarificate de conducere in acest sens au fost facute niste controale pe proiecte cu potential risc si au fost facute si niste schimbari in cadrul conducerii acestei directii
6380194 impresia mea dupa citirea acestei scrisori n r a ce a fost ca intre altele in aceasta directie a fost un pic de anchilozare in ultima vreme si initiative pe care ar fi trebui sa le aiba dincolo de controalele sistemice atunci cand observa situatii de risc trebuie sa le aiba cred ca acolo trebuia mai multa initiativa si i am cerut directorului sa ia masuri in acest sens
6380195 este probabil si asta o sa vedem dupa ce fac impreuna cu doamna secretar de stat cornelia mihai o analiza si o vina a unor presoane din conducere printr o insuficienta implicare si printr o cadere in rutina care face sa nu mai observam anumite aspecte care pot sa gripeze sistemul sau sa creezeastfel de probleme
6380196 pe parcurs au aparut elemente pe care auditorii comisiei au considerat ca nu sunt suficient de clar precizate in proceduri
6380197 cu siguranta voi face ameliorari in managementul agentiei care tin nu numai de persoane care pot tine si de persoane si de modul de organizare a agentiei pentru a ne asigura ca astfel de situatii vor aparea cat mai rar posibil pentru ca aceasta corespondenta cu comisia astfel de misiuni de audit vor fi permanente in perioada urmatoare
6380198 intentia mea prima intentie nu a fost sa ies in presa si sa discutam aceste chestiuni ci sa iau masuri cat mai repede
6380199 noi am hotarat sa ne mobilizam si sa il trimitem inainte de vacanta de vara de la comisie tocmai pentru ca reluarea platilor in conditii de siguranta sa se faca cat mai repede nu stiu daca am gresit sau nu probabil ca am gresit si aici imi asum faptul ca probabil ar fi trebuie sa cer agentiei sa comunice beneficiarilor aceste intarzieri care ar fi putut sa apara pentru ca unii dintre ei ar putea fi afectati de aceste intarzieri dar in rest responsabilitatea mea era sa iau masuri si sa ma asigur ca platile se reiau in conditii de siguranta cat mai repede
6380200 m am concentrat din punctul de vedere al fondurilor europene pe apia pe problemele de la bruxelles pe ceea ce tine de un ministru atata timp cat in minister avem secretari de stat si directori ai unei autoritati fiecare are responsabilitati
6380201 ceea ce pot sa imi reprosez este ca nu am urmarit mai atent anumite probleme tehnice eu stiam de cand am acceptat postul de ministru ca la agricultura asa cum stau treburile acum chiar si ca min istru trebuie sa intri in detalii tehnice pe care daca nu le urmaresti pot sa apara probleme mi se poate reprosa si dintr o parte si din alta acum sau dupa ce imi termina mandatul ca mi am facut treaba mai mult sau mai putin bine pana atunci incerc sa iau masurile in timp real pentru ca situatia sa se remedieze in cel mai scurt timp si sa nu se mai repete
6380202 ok desigur si va rog sa ma scuzati sa nu considerati ca va raspund pe un ton ironic dar ceea ce mi reprosez este ca nu am incercat sa fiu mai destepti decat toti conducatorii agentiei care au fost inaintea mea pentru ca ceea ce ne a solicitat comisia in acest moment este sa reconstruim toate procedurile din momentul 0 deci poate ca ar fi trebuit sa fiu mai destept decat toti cei care au luat decizii inaintea mea sa pun la indoiala toate deciziile luate anterior sa nu am incredere in sistem pot sa imi reprosez ca am avut acesta incredere in sistem
6380203 sa nu ne prinda sfarsitul lui septembrie inceputul lui octombrie fara ca situatia sa fie rezolvata
6380204 the recordings of the new album are more or less finished
6380205 the title of the album has been ready for a while so we might as well reveal it the new album will be entitled milorg so those of you that know your ww2 history will understand that we continue to pay tribute to the norwegian resistance during this period milorg is the title of one of the songs on the album while alarm amp bl cher is among the others
6380206 after 20 years in this sport it is very difficult its time to leave no matter how much you love it
6380207 i have never thought of retiring because i love diving
6380208 i like the feeling when i stand on the springboard i just cant give it up
6380209 must understand that if he attempts to break this chain of command the people will have to suffer for the army will not tolerate it and therefore there will be an unfortunate confrontation
6380210 ours is a coalition and decisions are to be made in a transparent way
6380211 it is to be understood however that our party alone is not running the new government
6380212 was musharraf the real problem even if he wasnt the solution
6380213 for you its just another story if you want the truth go to ghazni where you will get more than i can ever tell you about my sister
6380214 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6380215 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6380216 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6380217 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6380218 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day
6380219 a close look at the picture in newspapers in pakistan shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilized nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilized
6380220 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6380221 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6380222 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6380223 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
6380224 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6380225 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6380226 criminal betrayals and the deafening silence of our government media and civil society about all guantanamo prisoners especially pakistanis
6380227 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6380228 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6380229 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6380230 der prophet bekr ftigte in mehreren hadithen dass homosexuelle m nner zu t ten seien bei drei gelegenheiten verfluchte er diese menschen die muslimischen br der seien daher daran erinnert einem homosexuellen nicht die hand zu sch tteln denn man wei nie was f r bakterien und keime sich an seiner hand befinden und verderben bringen k nnten
6380231 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6380232 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6380233 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6380234 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6380235 the us mint has suspended sales of american eagle gold coins
6380236 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the futures contract price of gold on the commodities exchanges is substantially below the physical market price and that indeed the commodities exchanges are being used as gata long has maintained as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
6380237 the western central banks desperate to prop up a corrupt and tottering financial system have put gold so much on sale that even the us mint cant find any now
6380238 regardless of why silver went down by so much so fast why did it go down at all
6380239 many people agree there is a shortage of retail investor silver but they get confused by the lower price they think a lower price means more silver must have come into the market
6380240 well if one looks at the classical supply demand dynamic where the supply curve meeting the demand curve determines the price then yes silver supply must have come onto the market to swamp demand making the price go down thats the way things work everybody knows that do i look like i am stupid or something is that what you are saying youre saying im stupid like i dont understand supply and demand or something is that what you are saying punk
6380241 wrong o thats how all markets work price equilibrates demand and supply so that they equal each other
6380242 our markets are affected by paper silver futures contracts and very few people ever attempt to take delivery of that silver they buy it on leverage for the investment returns not for real silver so some people can sell silver promises to excess and never deliver and if they sell more paper silver than exists that can manipulate the price
6380243 the disconnect between supply and demand in gold amp silver markets
6380244 western markets are with the exception of some fabrication and industrial demand almost 90 paper based
6380245 managing deliveries of physical gold and silver to artificially reduce the quantities delivered
6380246 this looks like a good rock to step on to get off of this damned boat

6380256 my husbabd used to be a soldier although he has no experiences defusing mines he must remove them in order to live safely
6380257 although we knew that this was a minefield and were indeed very scared we still had to find a way to stay back
6380258 we later learned that a mine defusing organisation would come here to clear the mines we were very happy as we would be able to plant something on a clean land in the future
6380259 i was very scared because i couldnt see the mines but because i am poor i have to stay back here
6380260 the deminers work under scorching sun and you can imagine how tough it is to work for five and a half hours here every day
6380261 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6380262 i am going to miss her as a friend and colleague and her leadership will most certainly be missed by her constituents northeast ohio and the state as a whole
6380263 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6380264 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6380265 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care

6380269 iedereen die door een publiek orgaan benoemd is in een publieke positie
6380270 the public will quite rightly find this shocking he had an almost morbid fascination which escalated into curiosity and created a desire to see more images
6380271 news of his shameful and secret behaviour has brought shame stress and fear to his family
6380272 these horrifying images are some of the worst i have ever seen i recognise that you were not abusing young children but you are part of the system that led to the abuse of them
6380273 mum was the bubbly one behind the bar but dad was well known for pulling the best glass of beer in the city people would always tell him that
6380274 he was a wonderful dad he never told us what to do just gave out advice when we needed it he very rarely raised his voice because he didnt need to he commanded such respect
6380275 he was a very amiable person and was very well read and articulate he enjoyed working behind the bar and meeting people but i think he moved into the trade for mum really
6380276 he also loved his animals and was very upset when his dogs and cats passed away
6380277 we have made arrangements for staff to move to alternative office accommodation offices in existing council accommodation at dudley council plus and the council house building will be used and we are confident all staff will be relocated ahead of schedule
6380278 if we could get 100 per cent coverage that would be ideal and if we had more members it would reduce crime
6380279 parents worry about letting their children out to play because theres nowhere for them to go apart from on the streets
6380280 when we heard this funding would be spent on the adventure playground site parents were very pleased and we told our children who were very happy we finally thought we were going to get somewhere safe for our children to play and socialise
6380281 but little did we know it wasnt going to happen because of differences between the council and the committee but why should our children suffer and now i have heard that it will be built somewhere else our children deserve better
6380282 the working mans revenge on the safe middle class politically correct humour that has dominated comedy
6380283 this is a great opportunity for these talented young staffordshire athletes our aim in staffordshire is to play a part to make the games a resounding success

6380285 he is despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
6380286 oh that my grief were fully weighed and my calamity laid with it on the scales
6380287 the days of my prime when the friendly counsel of god was over my tent
6380288 all human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope
6380289 therefore be patient brethren until the coming of the lord my brethren take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord as an example of suffering and patience
6380290 one of our main challenges is locating the right person in our organisation to answer a customer query in a timely manner and then being able to contact them directly
6380291 this was underlined by a recent report that showed 20 percent of our contact centre agents time was spent looking for the right person in our organization to handle specific customer queries what we needed was a technology solution that would leverage our prior investment in a company wide videoconferencing system with new capability to unify voice video and customer information and provide personalised customer contact with improved customer service
6380292 nortel impressed us with the direct software integration between its communication network and microsofts office communications server software providing specific information about each of our expert resources available in real time to all of our branches
6380293 this gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people with our customers in a variety of different ways through audio video text and im and ensures that regardless of where our customers are located we have the resources available to serve them
6380294 were already looking past the initial implementation to the next phase of the project which will extend the reach of our video enabled unified communications services to our customers through the web
6380295 this will give customers direct access to our consultants through the video conferencing system presenting them with a new way of communicating directly with our staff without having to leave their homes
6380296 nortel and microsofts alliance gives them a clear time to market advantage thats well ahead of what any of their competitors could muster
6380297 it was also obvious that we were speaking the same language when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint through energy efficient technology and cutting back on unnecessary travel and it was also an easy sell to my cfo the operational savings weve calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line
6380298 nortels solution is helping necu overcome the challenges of one to one communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches some in remote rural areas
6380299 this unified communications approach will help necu stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of collaborating with each other and their service organisations using multiple web enabled devices in todays era of hyperconnectivity when anything that can be connected to the network is being connected

6380327 i found it quite easy because ive been reading science books for a long time before i did the course
6380328 i pretty much knew a lot of it already so i didnt have to revise a lot

6380330 he found it quite easy to be honest i wanted to go back because i did my education in another country and i was starting a job in a new school i wanted to learn more about science to help the kids i was working with
6380331 i had to do a lot of studying for it to make sure that i got a result that i wanted but he just did a bit of reading every now and then
6380332 i want him to be able to do something with his abilities so i do hope he becomes a scientist or something where he can make a difference to the world

6380337 habis ketiganya masing masing punya kelebihan dan kekurangan sebagai pemilih bapak tidak mau salah pilih kan
6380338 bapak sadar tidak dengan tidak ikut memilih berarti sebenarnya bapak sudah memilih yang akan menang dengan mematikan satu suara berarti bapak memperkecil jumlah pesaing itu berarti tanpa bapak sadari bapak akan memilih yang dapat suara terbanyak meskipun calon itu sebenarnya bukan pilihan bapak bahkan mungkin calon yang paling bapak hindari
6380339 golongan putih itu tidak ada itu hanya teori prakteknya pasti menguntungkan suara mayoritas kalau mau jadi kesatria bapak harus memilih
6380340 bapak mau jadi orang biasa saja ami ditawari lahir sekali lagi juga bapak tidak ingin jadi kesatria
6380341 karena aku belum tahu siapa yang akan aku pilih jadi gubernur dalam pilkada
6380342 habis ketiga tiganya punya kelebihan tetapi juga sama sama punya kekurangan
6380343 masak milih satu di antara tiga kan gampang sekali pak pilih yang paling ganteng saja
6380344 ya apa bedanya menantu yang baik itu kan menantu yang akan merawat dan memperhatikan mertuanya
6380345 wah itu kebangetan kita ini memilih petinggi yang akan memimpin pemerintahan untuk mengayomi kita semua kalau ukurannya hanya kebagusan bisa runyam masa depan kita jangan begitu bu memilih pemimpin itu harus berdasarkan program apa yang dijanjikan akan dilaksanakannya kalau nanti sudah menduduki kursi kekuasaan kalau programnya sesuai dengan kebutuhan kita boleh dipilih kalau tidak meskipun bagus jangan dipilih jadi dikacaukan
6380346 coba mana yang paling bagus di antara yang tiga itu
6380347 jangan begitu bu itu namanya ngawur jangan menilai calon pemimpin dari kebagusannya saja jangan hanya melihat apa yang sudah diperbuatnya meskipun bagus dan sudah banyak pujian atas perbuatannya tetapi ibu harus melihat apa orangnya tepat dan mampu untuk memimpin melindungi dan mengayomi kita semua dengan berbagai masalah kita sekarang di depan ini ibu jangan hanya pakai perasaan enaknya sendiri harus pakai pikiran kalau salah pilih berarti ibu juga ikut menjerumuskan kita semua pada bahaya
6380348 nah kalau sudah begitu berarti sebelum main coblos akan mikir jangan asal coblos apalagi ikut ikutan harus pakai perhitungan
6380349 ami bapakmu mengatakan ibu ini ngawur karena memilih calon gubernur dengan melihat kebagusannya
6380350 lho memilih itu memang ukurannya bagus kalau tidak bagus buat apa dipilih
6380351 bapakmu bilang yang harus dipilih bukan yang bagus tetapi yang berguna
6380352 yang bagus itu ya yang berguna dan yang berguna itu ya yang bagus
6380353 terserah ibu tapi kalau boleh menyarankan sebaiknya yang bagus dan berguna yang berguna tapi bagus
6380354 pemilihan itu bebas rahasia pak bapak jangan mempengaruhi pilihan ibu
6380355 bagaimana bisa memilih ami kalau tidak ada pengaruh yang membuat kita berani mengambil keputusan kamu juga sudah mencoba mempengaruhi bapak kan

6380369 i am grateful that they took their time to come here and help the people in this area
6380370 if we only unmasked the conspiracy all our problems would be solved but if the trouble is in all of us then we really are in trouble

6380372 well to do farmers go with their carts to the manors to carry off other peoples property
6380373 these farmers were not communists but they made communism possible
6380374 on what basis will be aristocracy continue to maintain both its authority and its political power
6380375 right through the motivational campaign theme they were doing everything right
6380376 the stature gap between obama and mccain widened dramatically in the mind of any viewer who watched
6380377 the political mind why you cant understand 21st century american politics with an 18th century brain
6380378 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6380379 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6380380 the primaries are preseason you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6380381 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6380382 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories
6380383 which reagan used to evoke a feeling of hope and promise in the country
6380384 when you talk about religion and faith based values you have to be nuanced i thought he was really earnest trying to explain who he was to an audience that largely disagreed with him these werent his guys
6380385 wow kuya logic naman so hindi ka nga mamamatay hallerrr
6380386 i have made it very clear that i am supporting senator obama and were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters but i think that delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc and so i think it would be better if we had a plan that actually we put in place and everybody knew what it was and then we executed it because i just think that would go more smoothly
6380387 but i think we have a problem that weve brushed aside and it is the time that we confront it head on
6380388 no i mean this hospital coffee i think im going to be sick
6380389 rolf you should take a chill pill or has that phrase become passe since i was in my coma

6380409 stefano used to call her the queen of the night
6380410 you knew that didnt you admit it this place is no longer safe we need to get out of here right now
6380411 it was just a crush but who wouldnt have a crush on him

6380413 thats right i called you doc maybe there is a piece of the old john inside me
6380414 i do not think saving for children puts parents into debt it certainly should not my advice to parents would be to certainly help their children as much as they are able to but without neglecting their own financial wellbeing
6380415 anything over and above a decent education should be seen as a bonus not a life s necessity if children are brought up to expect that they can always fall back on their parents then where is the incentive for them to make something of themselves

6380426 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children

6380428 what i say i base on biblical pronouncements based on gods word i am amazed that people are surprised when i quote from scriptures it shows the churches either arent preaching gods word or are watering it down

6380443 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6380444 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6380445 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles

6380455 in the sermons of wahhabi ultra conservative preachers on satellite television we hear the worst things about women like the fact that they should not be on the street but at home that they have an inferior status

6380480 but in the pleasures of sex with boys the tyrant comes off still much worse than in those with women for begetting offspring for i presume we all know these pleasures of sex give much greater enjoyment when accompanied with love but love in turn is least of all willing to arise in a tyrant for love takes pleasure in longing not for what is at hand but what is hoped for to take pleasure in the pain of whomever one loves to kiss and be hated to touch and be loathed must not these be distressing and pitiful affliction the private man knows his beloved serves under no compulsion but it is never possible for the tyrant to trust that he is loved
6380481 when we were brought to face to face with tyranny with a kind of tyranny that surpassed the boldest imagination of the most powerful thinkers of the past our political science failed to recognize it

6380524 canceling the moa would be tantamount to setting aside all the efforts of the peace panels since 2001
6380525 recent developments in the south have led to a change in the basic premise of our peace efforts the focus of our talks shall shift from the armed groups to the communities
6380526 the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiments the objective of our peace processes shall be the end of all forms of armed rebellion in the country
6380527 translated this shall mean a national rejection of armed struggle as a means of achieving political and societal change and reaffirming our commitment to democracy
6380528 engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation or ddr from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogues with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogue with the people
6380529 about the people and government telling armed groups to give up armed struggle
6380530 changes shall be defined primarily by the people and the government
6380531 the force of arms does not entitle any armed group to represent the people
6380532 i think its really obvious enough as i said that honest negotiation can become effective only in the atmosphere of peace and tranquility and this is the necessity for disarmament we cant allow a situation where we undertake peace process and the parties concerned are taking up arms
6380533 ang sa presidente naman is ang pagdidiin na makakapagpatuloy lamang ang proseso ng negosasyon ang proseso ng pakikipagtungo ng ating pamahalaan as far as the president is concerned what is important is the negotiation process the process of relating with the government the process of dealing with the government with our counterpart in the milf with a sheer demonstration of sincerity and goodwill

6380688 i received every award from every major veterans organization in america but the reason why i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them ive been endorsed in every election by all of the veterans organizations that do that ive been supported by them and ive received their highest awards from all of those organizations
6380689 republican presidential candidate sen john mccain appeared tuesday to suggest rationing of veterans health care may be needed so combat veterans can receive the care they deserve
6380690 we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and disabilities that are directly the result of combat
6380691 so heres my idea and its not originated with me but ive consulted with so many others who are here look we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that are directly the result of combat we need to expand our ability to treat ptsd ptsd is going to be tough in this war you know that and we need to treat the combat wounds we need to increase that ability to do so
6380692 these wars are the first to be waged in large numbers by a new generation of brave women but 15 percent of our women soldiers that served on the front lines who walk into a va facility screen positive for military sexual trauma is senator mccain suggesting that we cant afford to give them benefits senator mccains campaign did not return calls for comment about his statement but these are questions he must answer all veterans respect john mccains service if he too respects ours he should not be suggesting that we shortchange our soldiers with non combat injuries who have served with such honor and dignity
6380693 after touring the manchester va medical center va secretary james peake also said he is against giving veterans cards to let them receive treatment at non va facilities
6380694 the bush administration and sen john mccain for that matter initially opposed passage of the legislation which was supported overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans mccain campaigning last week used language suggesting he supported the bill in fact mccain did not even cast a vote on the final measure for bush and mccain to try to claim credit now for a bipartisan effort they both opposed is a plain attempt to hoodwink the american voter
6380695 under the webb bill veterans would receive maximum educational benefits after 36 months of service and those benefits would be tied to the full cost of public school tuition and expenses in the veterans home state the graham bill would require 12 years of service to garner a maximum benefit of 2000 per month with increases in that figure tied to the consumer price index critics point out that the cpi has been steadily outpaced by tuition increases
6380696 my proposal and others senator graham senator burn is well place incentives for people to stay in the military
6380697 yes the more you get because we want people to stay in we have to increase the benefits for the men and women who are serving and motivate those to serve
6380698 the john mccain who bragged about cracking down on lobbyists and corruption in 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain who is accepting money raised by one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption and brags about how proud he is of the lobbyists running his campaign
6380699 john mccain likes to call himself a reformer on the campaign trail but the facts show mccain is just another washington insider playing the same old broken politics no matter how you cut it john mccain cannot be counted on to bring change to washington

6380730 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects

6380783 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6380784 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6380785 provisionally suspended by the fei further to doping medication control tests that indicated the present of capsaicin in each horse
6380786 capsaicin is classified as a doping prohibited substance given its hypersensitising properties and as a medication class a prohibited substance for its pain relieving properties
6380787 were approaching retirement in the next six to seven years
6380788 if theres not enough faculty not enough courses we have a de facto enrollment cap
6380789 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6380790 with the economy the way it is college grads are finding a hard time finding jobs so its best to keep my education costs to a minimum
6380791 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6380792 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6380793 it helped motivate students to study more and try harder
6380794 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6380795 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
6380796 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city
6380797 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6380798 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6380799 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6380800 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6380801 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6380802 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6380803 i would never go back there in my life because if anything like that happens again theres no organization theres no plan
6380804 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
6380805 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job
6380806 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6380807 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6380808 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6380809 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6380810 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6380811 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6380812 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6380813 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6380814 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6380815 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6380816 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right
6380817 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture

6380840 de plannen moeten nog concreet gemaakt worden maar we zijn bezig om een aantal formats in de markt te zetten voor online videos waarbij ook de content word geleverd de nieuwe media afdeling van ilse media gaat hier eventueel gebruik van maken
6380841 we hebben ervoor gekozen om dat te scheiden rechts zie je alles wat op internet draait en links de video die twee communiceren met elkaar dat kan beide kanten opgaan
6380842 we houden het wel in de gaten momenteel zijn er nog geen plannen voor de korte termijn maar het zou best kunnen zijn dat we dat in de toekomst ook gaan aanbieden
6380843 we gaan de zakelijke kant op dat kan bijvoorbeeld e learning zijn maar ook e marketing of e commerce
6380844 bijvoorbeeld een video waarbij je in het rechtervenster een winkelwagentje plaatst
6380845 bij een product van bol com bijvoorbeeld een dvd kan je een video tonen met een trailer of een recensie waarbij aan de rechterkant het mandje van bol com wordt getoond zo kunnen de gebruikers het product meteen bestellen als ze ge nteresseerd zijn
6380846 ha look at all these millions of idiots who hate me
6380847 i believe in a god of some kind in some sort of higher being personally i find it very comforting
6380848 how can you take seriously someone who likes to believe something because he finds it comforting
6380849 if evidence were found for a supreme being i would change my mind instantly with pride and with great surprise would i find it comforting what matters is what is true and we discover truth by evidence not what we would like
6380850 if we get the answers from them aqua well work with them 100 percent if not well look for other channels
6380851 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
6380852 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
6380853 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
6380854 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
6380855 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
6380856 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
6380857 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
6380858 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
6380859 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
6380860 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
6380861 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
6380862 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
6380863 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
6380864 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
6380865 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
6380866 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
6380867 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
6380868 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
6380869 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
6380870 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
6380871 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
6380872 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
6380873 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
6380874 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
6380875 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
6380876 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town
6380877 commercial development should include the highest density high impact uses at the major node intersections while lower density low impact uses should be located at the minor nodes and town core areas
6380878 due to its physical constraints it is unlikely that study areas would support large scale industrial or retail development
6380879 please be advised that this property is in fact not located at an intersection
6380880 hmm good ideas summerfield will just keep being known as a bedroom community and we all can benefit from those higher gas prices on those commute times to work in greensboro and we all know what a high water mark food lion is
6380881 the public may be signaling that pursuing small time marijuana users is a waste of taxpayer resources
6380882 this issue suggests there is a libertarian streak in the thinking of the massachusetts voter
6380883 nel progetto una citt pi verde meno inquinata con nuove infrastrutture
6380884 using a four bit microcontroller i would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness from snow white to coal black the program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16 element table of initial timer values then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table at the end of the time delay it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast come back next week and ill show you a working prototype
6380885 toasters dont just turn bread into toast they are also used to warm frozen waffles what you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker as the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated they will demand more capabilities they will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage fry bacon and make scrambled eggs a toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete if we dont look to the future we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years
6380886 with this in mind we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem first create a class of breakfast foods specialize this class into subclasses grains pork and poultry the specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast muffins pancakes and waffles pork divided into sausage links and bacon and poultry divided into scrambled eggs hard boiled eggs poached eggs fried eggs and various omelet classes
6380887 the ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork dairy and poultry classes thus we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance at run time the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says cook yourself the semantics of this message depend of course on the kind of object so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs
6380888 reviewing the process so far we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food in the design phase we have discovered some derived requirements specifically we need an object oriented language with multiple inheritance of course users dont want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying so concurrent processing is required too
6380889 we must not forget the user interface the lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing users wont buy the product unless it has a user friendly graphical interface when the breakfast cooker is plugged in users should see a cowboy boot on the screen users click on it and the message booting unix v 8 3 appears on the screen unix 8 3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook
6380890 having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase an intel 80386 with 8mb of memory a 30mb hard disk and a vga monitor should be sufficient if you select a multitasking object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built in gui writing the program will be a snap imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware first design strategy to lock us into a four bit microcontroller
6380891 we should go for a little walk on the way home do you agree
6380892 keep going this way 15 mins we will be home
6380893 het project als doel heeft de handelskern rond het sint joostplein nieuw leven in te blazen dankzij een betere aanleg van de openbare ruimtes
6380894 ik bestudeer het baikalmeer al heel lang aanvankelijk vooral de tektonische structuur later verschoof de focus meer richting paleoklimaatonderzoek
6380895 sinds 2000 houdt onze onderzoeksgroep zich vooral bezig met methaanuitstoten in het meer het baikalmeer is het enige zoetwatermeer waar zulke methaanbronnen met gashydraten een verbinding van ijs en gas bestaan en we hebben ontdekt dat moddervulkanen daar iets mee te maken hebben
6380896 concreet willen we bestuderen hoe die moddervulkanen precies werken hoeveel methaan ze loslaten welke invloed dat heeft op de omgeving we willen ook kijken of er specifieke fauna en flora leeft op en rond die methaanbronnen
6380897 we werken al heel lang samen met het klimatologisch onderzoekscentrum in kirkuk later kwamen daar ook nog japanners bij nu vormen we eigenlijk een russisch japans belgisch consortium dat ook geld krijgt van bijvoorbeeld de vlaamse gemeenschap

6380909 she was a child who hungered for life determined to celebrate every moment each day brought to her
6380910 she was a child who was a blessing to everyone and our lives are all the poorer for her passing
6380911 such a young life filled with so much hope for the future and now she is gone
6380912 how do we respond to the gaping hole she leaves in our hearts and our lives yes we will cry and weep for the next while and so we should for a light has left our lives but what about the time after that
6380913 we could turn our tears to despair and spiral downwards into a life filled with shadows or we could instead choose to lead the kind of life joanne was living
6380914 rotisseried boneless leg of lamb with lemons and lemon baste plus some grilled pineapple
6380915 we expect to play a role in the news coverage
6380916 but were not so ambitious as not to recognize that the focus of media attention will be on and the democratic convention
6380917 you cant win the week during the other partys convention so there is no reason to try
6380918 there are a lot of issues that will be discussed at the democratic convention and there are also a number of contrasts on this campaign that can be made
6380919 sending a gaggle of congressmen or former cabinet secretaries to hang outside the other partys convention might get you 4 to 5 seconds on the local news but not much more then that
6380920 the key is to turn the page as quickly as possible after the other side finishes

6380994 the caldera antitrust lawsuit included some of the most damning evidence of microsoft misconduct breakware black propaganda all was there the potential embarrassment being such that there was good reason for microsoft to settle then try to pretend it never happened now however maybe it didnt ever happen because the evidence is being pulped

6381002 hits just business for microsoft and business is better when linux is limping so microsoft is trying to kill off the linux market leader by giving novell a compelling differentiator the day that novell becomes a threat to microsofts business however is the day that the deal is shut down
6381003 sco was enjoined from making certain claims in germany and it signed an agreement in 2003 not to say them there because its alternate choice was to have to prove them immediately so it chose silence as a result sco cant say in germany that linux violates scos ip or that end users could be liable for violations of scos intellectual property or that linux is an unauthorized derivative of unix unless it can prove it

6381009 the spiritual inclination and practise is rather helping us to do well in the professional life instead of wasting our time on partying or going to cinema we devote that time to meditation as arjun was a good warrior and krishna tought him to be same we can also be good professionals through the teachings of the bhagvad gita
6381010 even our senior accept that being spiritual helps bettering our performance therefore they are also advocating conducting seminars and discourses for others in the industry
6381011 yes others who are not exposed to the spirituality do make fun of us at times but ultimately they have to admit the way we are so it never becomes an issue
6381012 instead we are prepared to bear the stress and tension associated with our profession on account of this

6381041 as an it company cobweb believes it has a responsibility to lead the way by reducing our own environmental impact and by working with our customers we can achieve even more that is what our new green community is about collective action that makes a difference
6381042 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too

6381044 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives
6381045 this convention our largest ever demonstrated that young people care passionately about and propose solutions to the issues that ultimately affect us all education fair pay and climate change
6381046 we call on the government to introduce legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 and allow thousands more young people who want to exercise a right to vote to do so
6381047 the convention delegates were enthusiastic passionate and inspiring and the decision by the council to prioritise votes at 16 is a major boost to the campaign and to the coalition of other key organisations and political parties who already support it

6381061 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6381062 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6381063 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6381064 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6381065 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6381066 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations
6381067 we have all been there we call for service only to be 134 in the queue when we simply need a balance update or tracking number consumers are increasingly mobile and interact with a myriad of companies through call centers often using their mobile phones they demand quick response times and easy to use systems
6381068 sms provides an easy to use mobile solution that doesnt require long wait times or interactive voice response systems to better serve mobile customers and save money organizations with call centers should take advantage of text messaging
6381069 our customers prefer sms it saves them the trouble of having to dial in to the call center or visit a branch to get the account information they need with sms our customer gets convenience and fnb saves money in addition to delivering a better customer experience sms has also greatly reduced call center costs associated with communicating routine account information
6381070 with the widespread use of mobile phones and innate understanding of text combined with our customers desire to maintain active control of their finances fnbs incontact has provided our customers with the ability to take advantage of their cell phone as a powerful banking tool
6381071 interacting with customers through sms costs a fraction of what a live agent costs are so the cost savings for us have been tremendous and the communications are effective and pleasing to the customer which helps our business
6381072 organizations across all industries should take full advantage of these cost savings by implementing text based call center services in any industry financial services or otherwise
6381073 sms in the call center how mobile messaging can increase profits and reduce costs immediately

6381100 this deterioration of confidence is a sign that leaders arent meeting the needs of the organization
6381101 every business leader needs to take note of this if they want to grow their organization
6381102 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
6381103 this is scary considering the high rate of retirements were expecting over the next 5 10 years
6381104 organizations will have empty seats in key leadership roles if they dont begin planning for their future leadership
6381105 these arent good odds for programs that are supposed to increase success
6381106 organizations need to look at how theyre developing those individuals and identify why the failure rate is so high
6381107 when times get tough leadership skills are really put to the test and organizations with the right quality and quantity of leaders will weather the storm better than those less well prepared
6381108 its somewhat surprising to me that more attention isnt being paid to succession planning issues
6381109 having the right people prepared to fill key positions is an essential business strategy in this time of fierce competition for talent the defining moments in a companys ability to stay competitive may rest in the focus it places on filling key positions with assimilated and capable replacements
6381110 i have held executive level hr positions with several large companies and the importance placed on succession planning was extremely high
6381111 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6381112 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that

6381231 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
6381232 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
6381233 we developed a safe prescribing training programme that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2006 parts of our programme have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
6381234 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally
6381235 no other country in the world has such a system of standardised charts and we are hoping to share our work around the world

6381255 when i saw the start he made to the race i just thought wow it was a much better start than the one he made in winning the 100m on saturday
6381256 this is bolts favourite event and he wanted that record he went for it he came here focused on it he knew that most likely hed win gold but gave it every single thing he had
6381257 my concern and the reason i thought he might not get the world record here was that he wouldnt have been working on his speed endurance the ability to hold that speed for the entire race
6381258 i dont see any reason why he couldnt now move up to the 400m but im not sure if hell be able to break the world record in that
6381259 to be honest this was a below par show by rajiv of course mocco was superior of the two but i still feel rajiv could have done better we did not expect him to win but rajiv did not try enough

6381267 thats not a problem going that late theyve been working with safety darcel mcbath and the first unit or the second unit for a while the calls are still the same were not going to miss anything in continuity with the first group of guys
6381268 the coaches mentioned today how were going to eliminate it down to 28 players on both sides so everybodys just trying to step their game up right now and make that 28 cut
6381269 when you get everybody thinking too much theyre trying to do this do that he has everybody in pretty much one gap come down here thats what he wants were hurting on the run defense thats what were trying to stop so were just trying to get everybody coming downhill to stop the run
6381270 everybody doesnt have to think you see a run you come downhill you go to your gap and if everybody does their assignment were going to make the play every time
6381271 its a disaster a big melted mess it was like a house fire where it burns at the ceiling we probably lost 80 to 90 per cent of everything on board

6381388 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill npws spokesman john dengate said
6381389 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6381390 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6381391 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard mr dengate said
6381392 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6381393 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6381394 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6381395 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6381396 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem mr harrison said
6381397 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6381398 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin mr iemma said
6381399 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and a pod that will care for him mr iemma said
6381400 did you not pronounce the benediction before the meeting was ended
6381401 because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6381402 while i am pleased at ali release i am extremely concerned that this was the third time he was detained without explanation
6381403 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6381404 a quantum of gifted practitioners in the arts and crafts sector is limited in expanding the frontiers of their businesses by lack of access to credit they further lack the awareness on the appropriate steps to take in accessing credit facilities from the financial service providers

6381510 the idea of a goddess of destruction is one that ive cherished for a long time cedric victor bassist and visual collaborator mentioned kali when we were recording because of the thematic similarities to the songs i had already written
6381511 as we progressed everything seemed to come together around this theme of respect reverence for strength and simultaneous repulsion fear of power
6381512 i knew it was nascars prerogative but i never actually believed the number change was going to happen unless i heard different from nascar
6381513 weve had the 4 for a long time and there is a lot of history there
6381514 i think nascar respects the history of morgan mcclure motorsports and i think they made the right decision
6381515 we had some hiccups in the 4 with larry mcclure
6381516 im not sure there was enough due diligence when it came to knowing for sure if mr mcclure was going to have a car for next year we spoke with nascar and nascar said that that number was available and im not sure that all the way around that enough due diligence was done
6381517 weve been told that mcclure is going to run some races next year and to us especially me as a car owner we know how much car numbers mean to teams and organizations
6381518 even though nascar has given us that number for next year if mr
6381519 as a fellow car owner i know how important that would be to me so we wanted to make sure that hes got his number back for next year with the word that hes going to be running some races next year

6381536 roger salinas was the last person who should have taken my son to the hospital
6381537 when he wasnt feeling well he would come into my office and ask to be committed
6381538 he was a very mellow very kind of shy person
6381539 salinas took my son into another room and closed the door then i just heard my boy screaming
6381540 there was nothing that could even be considered a beating
6381541 these people are i dont want to go out on a limb but i was born and raised here and there was no beating
6381542 we were so afraid that i just said andy we have to forget about this
6381543 common practice is if you have a vehicle with no cage a person riding in the back with a seatbelt and no restraints is a lot more dangerous
6381544 we looked at all the counties with similar populations and we were something like 13 to 17 percent under the average pay
6381545 i also looked at surrounding counties and found were a little under 10 percent underpaid
6381546 the commissioners are responsible for just about everything that happens in the county
6381547 sooner or later it all funnels down to us and down is the right word
6381548 we tried to get the employees up to snuff too
6381549 he tortured us he was the only boy and he was the oldest
6381550 we laugh about it now he was so proud that hed do that to the point that wed still remember 20 years later
6381551 but he was also very protective he was the epitome of a big brother
6381552 every year wed go to south padre island for the fourth of july one time there was a big storm and the power went out and he came out with a scream mask and a flashlight
6381553 hes the only person i know who would think to bring a mask to the beach
6381554 everybody came by every year to see what hed come up with
6381555 when he got sick id tell people it was such a shame because he was the best man ive ever known
6381556 he proved you didnt have to have money and be flashy to be a good person
6381557 the death toll is close to 40 and there are about 60 wounded many of them in critical condition
6381558 shooting water next to st anthony i dont know about that

6381570 this is not an easy land for any candidate and you might say a black one has more trouble than most
6381571 traditionally we kept a standing inventory of rabies vaccine and distributed it around the state based on need
6381572 when all this happened the manufacturer discontinued selling for standing inventory and would only sell on a case by base basis
6381573 we get five calls a day for rabies possible human exposures
6381574 we get five to 10 bite reports faxed to us
6381575 but we really rarely go forward and provide the vaccinations for patients from the standpoint of post exposure unless its a high risk exposure like in a bat raccoon coyote or fox
6381576 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats one line of inquiry officers are investigating is that the boy may have been chased prior to the fall
6381577 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed
6381578 many others have been injured and we expect casualties to rise in the coming hours
6381579 one of the aims of irans 10 year space program is to send a manned rocket into space

6381581 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6381582 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6381583 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6381584 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6381585 the vets have had a look theyve said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6381586 the whole issues been quite harrowing not only for our staff but for the community in general where people have really been concerned about this whale
6381587 because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6381588 while i am pleased at ali release i am extremely concerned that this was the third time he was detained without explanation
6381589 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6381590 when the original album was released on vinyl the song included sounds out of the human hearing range this has led to rumors that cecilia was actually written about simons black lab cecilia
6381591 so many people i meet online and in person tell me they have read my blog and they always have something to say about it good bad otherwise but hardly anyone leaves a comment on the site
6381592 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6381593 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6381594 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6381595 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6381596 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6381597 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6381598 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6381599 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6381600 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6381601 we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers

6381607 california has a proud legacy of offering protection and safety to the victims of such horrific crimes and i am pleased that the border states are coming together at this years conference to collaborate on solutions to this crime that will work on both sides of the border
6381608 remember the last time she went to endorse barack obama she did it in a way driving up from palm springs she calls me and said i just talked to oprah and shes there and blah blah blah and said what do you think and i said go ahead do it

6381715 es sabido que rusia contempla la defensa antimisiles estadounidense en europa como una amenaza a su propia seguridad la firma del acuerdo refleja las aspiraciones de condoleeza rice de aprovechar el momento propicio y realizar sus no muy exitosos esfuerzos para propagar en la alianza graves declaraciones anti rusas la conexi n es evidente en cualquier caso el primer ministro polaco donald tusk no la niega tras los sucesos en el c ucaso es evidente que necesitamos garant as de seguridad declar tusk est claro que el despliegue en polonia de los misiles antimisil estadounidenses no mejora la perspectiva de normalizaci n de las relaciones ruso polacas en el apogeo de la crisis en el c ucaso donald tusk manifest juiciosamente que polonia no debe ser el pa s de la ue que peores relaciones tiene con rusia sin embargo la firma del acuerdo sobre la defensa antimisiles no a ade a estas relaciones elementos de confianza
6381716 todos se ven amenazados por todos de ah que varsovia y praga hayan hecho caso omiso de las protestas moscovitas contra el escudo antimisiles americano creen que el kremlin no toma nota del deseo de seguridad polaco y checo porque mosc sabe muy bien que el sistema ya solo por motivos t cnicos no puede dirigirse contra rusia praga y varsovia est n convencidas de que mosc no procede al rearme para protegerse contra ataques el kremlin quiere utilizar al ej rcito directamente para intervenciones militares o como instrumento de presi n pol tica
6381717 ahora el argumento es que la creaci n de bases de defensa que deben proteger a europa contra posibles ataques de ir n son comparables al estacionamiento de misiles nucleares sovi ticos en cuba que afortunadamente fue impedido
6381718 la guerra entre rusia y georgia no ha quitado hierro a ninguno de los argumentos contra el escudo antimisiles

6381722 el mi rcoles rusia rechaz en el consejo de seguridad un proyecto de resoluci n sobre georgia presentado por francia a primera vista esta decisi n parece escandalosa despu s de que los presidentes dmitri medvedev y nicol s sarkozy acordaran seis principios para regular la paz que recibieron el nombre de plan medvedev sarkozy por qu entonces mosc se niega a apoyar en el consejo de seguridad el plan acordado por los presidentes de los dos pa ses seg n churkin la delegaci n francesa paralelamente a la resoluci n que contiene los puntos del plan medvedev sarkozy ha elaborado un documento completamente diferente contiene una variante truncada de los acuerdos alcanzados entre par s y mosc y tambi n nuevos puntos escritos pr cticamente al dictado de la delegaci n estadounidense en particular de los seis puntos del plan de regulaci n de paz s lo quedan dos

6381727 la crisis rusa georgiana el ltimo tira y afloja por el dominio regional y el deterioro de la situaci n de seguridad en afganist n han puesto de manifiesto una vez m s el nuevo viejo desaf o de la otan en el siglo xxi
6381728 la situaci n que aqu se plantea no s lo condicionar significativamente la seguridad regional durante los pr ximos a os sino que tambi n determinar el futuro de la otan y su propia credibilidad como una alianza militar capaz y proveedora de seguridad la otan debe actuar con decisi n para llenar el vac o de seguridad que ha dejado al mundo vulnerable ante la creciente amenaza terrorista y la otan debe hacer valer su importancia en el mundo posterior al 11 s
6381729 los criterios para una intervenci n estatal son tan poco concretos que le ofrecen un peligroso margen de interpretaci n al gobierno a la hora de decidir cu ndo una participaci n extranjera en una empresa alemana supone una amenaza para la seguridad y el orden p blico la falta de seguridad jur dica no es una buena base para transferencias de capital multimillonarias quien rodea su mercado de capital con muros de protecci n adicionales no puede sorprenderse si el capital internacional esquiva alemania

6381732 la decisi n de nicolas sarkozy en abril de reforzar la presencia militar francesa en afganist n en respuesta a las demandas de los aliados especialmente estadounidenses ha sido criticada por la izquierda y ha suscitado reservas por parte de la derecha al aceptar asumir el riesgo en afganist n el gobierno quiere elevar el nivel de solidaridad con sus aliados y apuntarse el logro de que acepten su visi n de una defensa europea esta pol tica se apoya en s lidos argumentos pero su campo de aplicaci n es peligroso par s hab a exigido una revisi n de la estrategia de la otan cuyo fracaso es patente ya es hora de proceder a la redefinici n de los objetivos de la alianza y de sus medios
6381733 las noticias que llegan de afganist n son realmente alarmantes esta semana las fuerzas talibanas organizaron dos de sus m s complejos y audaces ataques de esta guerra unos cien insurgentes mataron a diez paracaidistas franceses en un ataque en las cercan as de kabul al menos diez terroristas suicidas montaron un asalto coordinado contra una de las mayores bases estadounidenses hiriendo a tres norteamericanos y a seis soldados afganos un atentado anterior en la base hab a matado a doce trabajadores afganos no hay tiempo que perder a no ser que estados unidos la otan y sus aliados centroasi ticos act en con rapidez podr an perder esta guerra
6381734 habr que enviar m s tropas terrestres norteamericanas a afganist n la excesiva tendencia del pent gono a realizar ataques a reos que han producido v ctimas civiles ha enemistado peligrosamente a la poblaci n afgana la otan precisa asimismo incrementar su esfuerzo b lico con rusia tratando de volver a trazar el mapa postsovi tico de europa no es momento para que la otan enturbie su credibilidad militar perdiendo una guerra tampoco europa dispone de muchas tropas terrestres disponibles pero ha de enviar las mejores a afganist n y dejarlas combatir la guerra en afganist n no tiene car cter secundario es el principal enfrentamiento militar entre ee uu y la otan y las fuerzas responsables del 11 de septiembre y posteriores atentados terroristas en suelo europeo washington la otan y los gobiernos afgano y paquistan deben dejar de luchar por inercia y desarrollar una estrategia para vencer si no todos perderemos
6381735 veinticuatro horas despu s del atentado contra la academia de gendarmer a de issers que caus 43 muertes y otros tantos heridos los terroristas han reincidido ayer en bouira cometiendo dos ataques casi simult neos el primero contra el sector militar de la ciudad y el segundo contra el hotel sophie cerca de donde los trabajadores tienen costumbre de esperar el transporte que les lleva a sus lugares de trabajo ahora que las intenciones de estos criminales se han puesto claramente en evidencia s lo una respuesta vigorosa pod ra tranquilizar al ciudadano calmar su angustia y atenuar su miedo ante la proximidad del mes sagrado durante el cual la nebulosa terrorista multiplica sus ataques en una palabra la ley del tali n

6381737 la expropiaci n de cemex en venezuela es la cr nica de algo anunciado desde hace casi tres a os por eso sorprende la tibieza del gobierno mexicano y su aparente falta de estrategia a hugo ch vez se le pueden criticar muchas cosas pero nadie puede decir que no avis lo que ven a en el discurso inaugural de su tercer periodo en diciembre de 2006 hugo ch vez anticip una nueva etapa y habl de grandes nacionalizaciones de entonces a la fecha el gobierno venezolano ha invertido cerca de 11 mil millones de d lares en recomprar empresas telef nicas el ctricas alimenticias financieras y cementeras
6381738 el estilo jalisco domina las pol ticas del gobierno venezolano la toma de las instalaciones de cemex representa un claro mensaje para todos los que tienen tratos o negociaciones con la administraci n p blica este mensaje consiste en que si no se acepta el criterio oficial las autoridades proceden distinto a lo que es usual en las negociaciones econ micas utilizan el ej rcito la guardia nacional y pobladas vociferantes uniformadas con camisetas rojas sin entrar a juzgar la pertinencia de la nacionalizaci n de las compa as cementeras o la exactitud de las auditor as y evaluaciones efectuadas el m todo capone debe ser rechazado por todos los venezolanos

6381746 este sevilla tiene la mejor plantilla de las ltimas temporadas
6381747 el sevilla ha crecido much simo hay una plantilla impresionante y es el mejor equipo de los cuatro a os
6381748 tiene que ir paso a paso con el objetivo principal de la liga de campeones que es muy importante y si se consigue ser muy valioso pero tambi n con opciones de luchar por algo m s
6381749 que ser m s realistas y saber que ganar una liga es muy complicado porque hay equipos muy importantes
6381750 el que hayan venido jugadores como konko squillaci y fernando navarro gente que defensivamente ha estado a un gran nivel se va a notar

6381759 van a estar al mismo nivel que los de cualquier otro conjunto
6381760 es sacar adelante la ley concursal y que el equipo quede lo m s arriba posible en un a o dif cil
6381761 no s lo por el resultado sino por el juego y la imagen lamentable que se dio
6381762 creo que cada uno a nivel particular debe hacer una autocr tica muy fuerte y pensar que lo que hicimos el a o pasado nos cost mucho trabajo y no podemos tirarlo de esa manera
6381763 ya contra el sevilla se vio al equipo muy carente de juego y de chispa ya fuimos inferiores ayer martes ante el valladolid hicimos una primera parte decente pero en la segunda parte cometimos errores que no pueden cometer un equipo de primera divisi n
6381764 el protagonismo de la informaci n debe ser s lo de los servicios informativos

6381767 campbell did it with the prevalent fuel of the day were doing it with the prevalent fuel of tomorrow
6381768 donald campbell had his massive cubic capacity engines and energy dense fossil fuels we have just the wind
6381769 but the wind will still be here in 50 or 100 years time the age of renewables has been a long time coming back but will endure
6381770 we need the weather to come right the lake is wet at the moment and it should be dry this time of year and we need the wind window which is coming any day now
6381771 the lake is 500 sq km and is a salt lake so its very flat and we can sail in any direction it has some good wind as well but its really the space we need

6381776 the generic names dotmobi is making available at this auction reflect the wide range of mobile consumer interests
6381777 these names represent the forthcoming applications and content that will deliver everyday convenience and entertainment to mobile users around the world imagine an easy to access pharmaceutical directory for on the spot information at drugs mobi viewing price comparisons and consumer reviews while in a store at computers mobi or finding out about flight delays at airlines mobi of course those are just ideas it will be exciting to watch how brands and businesses apply their own creativity to these names to drive interest in the mobile web
6381778 the inclusion of the mobi domain into domainsbots search and suggestion tool illustrates the success of mobi and proves that the internet community is committed to the growth of the mobile web as a distinct channel
6381779 as a company dotmobi ensures that once mobi internet addresses are acquired they are developed in a way that makes surfing the mobile web a quality experience for all consumers regardless of location carrier or handset
6381780 as more and more web site owners and marketers look to grow their business onto the mobile web we felt it was important to offer to them mobi domains so that they could go mobile more easily
6381781 the mobi domain is now a significant part of the web we wanted to make it possible for our customers to participate in this next wave of the internet
6381782 there would be no delay and be one cohesive response
6381783 the organizations will be able to court volunteers by presenting their needs then the volunteers decide
6381784 the daytime volunteer is still there but the numbers are not what they used to be
6381785 when people listen to what these organizations have to say they may be able to see some potential in themselves that they never thought about before
6381786 they are looking for things to do and have specific talents now that they have more time on their hands they want to share those talents
6381787 even if its just sending a greeting card it can be especially helpful for those residents who have little or no family
6381788 we always have more students than we can handle she said
6381789 but the more hands to help the easier the job is for everyone
6381790 i think its a great new way to get the word out about our mission to save injured native pennsylvania wildlife
6381791 the http chinaredcross mobi site is important in that it establishes a new information channel for us china has a very large pool of mobile users and we anticipate that more people will support the rcsc humanitarian initiatives via their mobile phone we regard our pc based web site and now our mobile web site as important channels for our work
6381792 globally mobile web sites are receiving increased attention from governments and businesses due to the popularity of mobile phones and the improvement of mobile internet content
6381793 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
6381794 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6381795 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
6381796 the enormous popularity of mobile devices has had a profound effect on the lifestyle of the consumer unleashing new levels of connectivity and personal mobility when planning campaigns global brands need to ensure they take into account the role the mobile device can play in helping them engage with customers and that they create campaigns that have been developed specifically for mobile applications the surveys findings show how easily consumers were turned off by earlier ill conceived mobile campaigns with mobile devices more ubiquitous powerful and sophisticated than ever there is a real opportunity for brands to deliver ground breaking mobile campaigns that captivate engage and entertain their customers
6381797 the results from this research signify the need for a better mobile experience something that dotmobi is committed to making available to consumers globally
6381798 the free services that dotmobi offers like deviceatlas ready mobi and the dotmobi developer forum ensure that developers and marketers can give consumers a mobile web experience that is useful and complementary to the mobile lifestyle
6381799 the mobi domain quickly lets consumers know that a site will work on a mobile phone its also the most widely used naming convention among the nielsen top 10 web sites so consumers are learning to guess mobi when trying to find a site on a mobile phone theyre seeing that theyll have a more positive internet experience on their mobile phone anytime and anywhere
6381800 and now that more than 1 million mobi names have been registered the availability of rich diverse content for mobile consumers is growing daily
6381801 fifteen to 20 people have been killed in two blasts
6381802 the second time we put the fence up we moved it in five feet and the last time a foot and a half eventually the propertys going to be eroded right into the lawn there
6381803 my father used to work for macleans ready mix and anything that was left over they used to dump here
6381804 it will be in the millions of dollars what we intend to do is say well this is the remedy we have a problem here now we want you to pay for the repairs
6381805 my people are trying to arrange a meeting with him i am going to tell him if i win the parliament seat i can help develop his constituency so both of us can share the credit
6381806 his offer is as a sign of desperation maybe he realises that bn is going to lose the election
6381807 we are at war how can we negotiate with the enemy pas cannot afford to destroy pakatan rakyat i will always defend the coalition
6381808 there are almost two billion mobile internet users today and were tailoring our organizations services to better serve those needs
6381809 dotmobi recently released the results of a study that showed consumers want useful practical content available for their mobile phones autism mobi is an excellent example of that as well as being a site which is designed to serve the needs of a community globally people are more likely to have a mobile phone with internet access than a computer with internet access and having a mobi site available allows an organization to reach a greater population who will be able to benefit from its services
6381810 i know that there are some expectations to do something before the end of the year
6381811 bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach
6381812 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6381813 we group together products into one place that generate significant margin and still smash high street pricing
6381814 it makes it easier for our customers to identify key opportunities and to gain the real benefit of the market expertise and purchasing power our procurement team have developed over our ten years in the channel
6381815 besonders wichtig ist es uns einen dauerhaften ber die studienlaufzeit hinaus anhaltenden therapieerfolg zu erzielen
6381816 die m glichkeit die aktivit t und ern hrungssituation von patienten kontinuierlich mit nur einem tragbaren standardhandy beobachten und analysieren zu k nnen ist entscheidend f r den erfolg medizinischer langzeittherapien
6381817 auf dieser grundlage wird es zum beispiel schon bald m glich sein diabetespatienten bei der t glichen bestimmung ihres insulinbedarfes zu unterst tzen denn auch der h ngt entscheidend mit der individuellen k rperlichen aktivit t des betroffenen zusammen
6381818 when mowsers founders decided to make the assets available dotmobi was first in line to acquire them the work russell and mike put into making mowser a best of breed product is well known throughout the industry being able to add that technology into dotmobis product line is exciting because it will exponentially stimulate mobile content growth
6381819 at its heart mowser is a pc website to mobile website content adaptation engine
6381820 dotmobi has been vocal against blind content adaptation because it doesnt allow site owners to have control over their content dotmobi believes that brands and businesses should always have the final say over how their material is presented and that the content should uniquely take advantage of the capabilities of a mobile device this has been one of our core philosophies all along and something dotmobi is looking forward to addressing with the integration of the mowser assets into the dotmobi product line
6381821 find mobi was an exciting project for us although we have not until now formally announced its availability find mobi is already receiving significant traffic and it has been implemented as a private labeled mobile search engine for one european operator with additional customers in the pipeline so we feel confident weve created a useful valuable tool
6381822 find mobi was originally created by dotmobi to illustrate and communicate to mobile search vendors how we thought that search should be done to make the mobile web more compelling when we looked at early mobile search sites we were disappointed we simply did not think that it made sense to return non mobile content as part of a mobile query find mobi was built to serve as an example to the search industry to change the way that it should think about search when applied to mobile but find mobi has outgrown the lab and now its time for find mobi to get a better home where it can continue to grow

6381824 you could always sense on faces at this time of year who was anxious about going back or starting school
6381825 this is the first time were looking at the k 12 response
6381826 as educators we are aware of the impact bullying has on children
6381827 our primary goal is to make sure the school environment is healthy and conducive to learning for all children
6381828 to get at things that affect kids over a lifetime such as persistent name calling
6381829 that will leave some kid excluded and some kid the target i would argue that nobody has to go through that
6381830 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6381831 until someone makes you aware of what to look for you dont know the signs
6381832 theyve had to deal with things in their lives that i will never see theyve had murders and drug addictions and all of this loss but they are so resilient
6381833 we have to partner with other organizations because the federal money just doesnt go very far
6381834 shelters didnt want to bother with all of the red tape to get them enrolled school districts didnt want to deal with them and parents had so many problems they didnt want to deal with it
6381835 we make sure they have backpacks uniforms and school supplies
6381836 there have been several fires in the district and we know about them but we dont always know about a family losing a job unless someone tells us there are also kids who move out of their homes and live with friends because of problems within the family such as divorce drinking or drugs they try to escape these situations
6381837 if we find out the student is homeless we provide whatever services they need and we hook up many times with gail odorcich
6381838 a time comes in your life when you finally get it

6382015 once qadi muhammad and i this writers father were going through his books and the above volume we examined it in part and found that mulla jami had demonstrated arrogance towards amirul momineen hazrat ali we read the derogatory remarks our sense of faith was aroused and our islamic identity sensitised the book was brought to kashmir for the first time it was not found in any part of kashmir before the arrival of mulla farhi farji although its contents had reverberated in these lands after studying all the derogatory remarks mulla farhi was told that jami had composed a satire on ali and had been very arrogant towards him but mulla farhi said that they qadi muhammad and my father were accusing jami of prejudice against ali whereas he jami had actually composed an encomium for ali there was no proof of condemnation or satire he said that they had not understood the text because of their inadequate knowledge and lack of analytical comprehension thereupon qadi muhammd read out a few verses from the above named book and asked him mulla farhi to explain and bring out the meaning of a few verses mulla ahmad was head to tail drowned in sectarian prejudice and said that they were not able to comprehend the meaning of mulla jamis verses he said that even the men of learning and eminence were unable to understand what jami said how then could people of lesser intellectual faculty be able to comprehend him he snatched away the book from the hands of the qadi and asked what had he to do with the book the qadi exhibited great patience and restraint but the writers father could not stomach the remark he stood up and overpowered the foreigner placing his feet on the latters chest he snatched the book from his hands and gave it to araki qadi muhammad also followed the writers father maulana khaleelullah to the presence of mir shams they just wanted to know what araki had to say about the work mulla ahmad khwajeh too had accompanied the qadi they recounted the whole story to araki he said that that was not the volume which contained jamis canard however the qazi said that it was the same book thereupon said

6382026 julys robust rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6382027 abstracting from this volatility sales appear to have been broadly flat since the start of this year whats more we suspect that the official figures are still giving an overly upbeat picture
6382028 theres a huge amount of variation in these figures and i wouldnt put a huge weight on it
6382029 i think we are going to see further weakness in retail sales going forward i am not sure it is going to be every month because they are volatile but you will see official retail sales match up with survey evidence

6382337 since a very young age ive always been like an obsessive collector
6382338 when i find something that i like i just keep collecting things akin to it
6382339 you can find something so important in an object that so many people find to be completely valueless
6382340 you know how little kids just love the weirdest things
6382341 for some reason theyll just love some object some shape and theyll just play around with it and always have it near them its wonderful
6382342 i think one of the first things we really liked doing together was going to thrift stores
6382343 we like the same weird stuff you know we have a similar way of seeing the world
6382344 a lot of our instruments are like weird old organs and discarded sound makers of different kinds and it very much feeds into that thing of the object
6382345 i mean there really wasnt ever any question we never questioned what we were doing or questioned the songs we just kind of made them
6382346 were both very confident people i think and we knew that they felt right and i dont think we ever really imposed any limitations on that i think more than anything music brought us together we have a real musical kinship and its really pretty simple
6382347 when youre young you only see this little fragment of the city you dont fully understand a place going away and getting that perspective on it was just great
6382348 i never intended going back to baltimore until it was right about time to make the decision then i started to think about these other places and how wonderful baltimore really was
6382349 it doesnt have that really cosmopolitan thing it doesnt have people telling you what is in style or what is cool it just has this incredible independence from the rest of the east coast and it doesnt really have the job economy to support fair weather fans
6382350 we recorded the bulk of it without knowing wed have anyone putting out our record it was like now that weve got all these songs lets record them so we recorded them in two days in my basement
6382351 the feelings and the meanings of those songs are so much in the sounds of those old instruments
6382352 i think its really hard to attach exact meanings or emotions to songs and i think thats why victorias lyrics are so large and so amazing theyre really a mystery and so non specific they just draw up these feelings and memories
6382353 a song can be like sexy one night or it can feel really depressing one night or it can feel almost ecstatic it can feel really old or new
6382354 nunca te justifiques os amigos n o precisam e os inimigos n o acreditam
6382355 down there is where you develop up here its a pennant race if you ask if the decision was right id say it was
6382356 tough situation were in a pennant race and were in boston and a lot of focus is on him and he feels the responsibility
6382357 i think coming into this game we were all excited about watching him pitch but the way it unraveled makes it kind of obvious we had to do something
6382358 instead of going out there and gritting my teeth and say im going to get this guy out i go out there and think whats going to happen next
6382359 against boston youve got to be able to hit with men on base
6382360 youve got to score when you get opportunities to score because you never know if youre going to have enough runs
6382361 it was tough early but he kept us in the game hung on right there and he gave us a chance to come back
6382362 he kind of figured it out a little bit he went through a rough start but he ended up pretty good
6382363 hvis det er noen sanger dere kan s syng med
6382364 det st r 200 mennesker der ute og venter men vi sa det var nok
6382365 weve had a tough start playing the team who finished third followed by the ones who finished fifth
6382366 to finish fifth was a great success and they will be hurting after saturdays defeat so we have to be ready for them because they will want their first points
6382367 we need to rise to the challenge of playing a team who on numerous occasions last year got victories away from home
6382368 every manager likes to strengthen and okay theyve lost a striker
6382369 but on their day they are a pretty awesome team
6382370 im sure theyd rather come to us than go to old trafford
6382371 they will be looking to beat all the teams outside the top six or so and will come as a hungry side on the back of a defeat
6382372 they have different strengths and they are very important strengths
6382373 they win a lot away from home because of their style of play
6382374 they are more attritional and more up and at you than arsenal
6382375 we have to be ready for the work rate and commitment of everton if we fall short of that we will be on the receiving end

6382384 last year he made a point of wanting to show that he was going to be a part of something that he was committed to and i think hes living it out and playing it out this summer and i think hes done a great job representing the united states and representing his team

6382408 hes been a valuable employee with us for quite a long time
6382409 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak
6382410 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds
6382411 i read something that said that hes faster than me theyre probably right
6382412 there has been an obvious increase in the level of chinas performances over recent years
6382413 the podium is the goal but i consider myself successful as long as i can just row my best
6382414 its hard to name a single reason for the improvement
6382415 there are a lot of factors involved the success will definitely continue
6382416 im not sure if the problem is in my training
6382417 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6382418 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6382419 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6382420 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the starts we will be okay
6382421 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6382422 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6382423 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6382424 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6382425 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6382426 we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers

6382465 notting hill carnival is the highlight of the year for many thousands of londoners and visitors to our city
6382466 there is absolutely no excuse for anyone to take a weapon to the carnival and for anyone tempted to do so the message is clear you will be caught
6382467 carnival has a fantastic atmosphere and we see ourselves as key players in the overall event to allow people to enjoy all it has to offer
6382468 the large majority of people go to the carnival to enjoy the music and the sights but we want to make sure anyone who has other intentions knows what they can expect from us especially if they try to bring weapons to the event
6382469 mobile metal detection arches will be deployed throughout the tube network to detect and deter people carrying weapons
6382470 we are able to move the metal detectors at any time across the network sending a very clear message dont bring weapons to the carnival because we could be anywhere

6382473 es indudable que el p blico busca la manera de externar su cari o y apoyo a los rbd pero creo que se debe reconsiderar la opci n podr an ponerse en riesgo todos los involucrados y no es la forma de lograr que el grupo permanezca el resultado ser a una histeria total

6382503 had he been in a place and needing to sit and rest before creating the throne then the question
6382504 allah is above the heavens above the throne above everything with a loftiness fawqiyya which does not make him any closer to the throne or the heavens just as it does not make him any further from the earth he is close to everything in existence he is closer to the servant than his jugular vein and he is a witness over all things
6382505 allahs establishment on the throne is an action he has created named
6382506 the correct position according to us is the interpretation of the throne in this verse to mean the sovereignty
6382507 it must not be said when was he or where was he or how was he he exists without a place
6382508 what do you say about abu zayd al qayrawani d
6382509 allah is above his exalted throne in person bi dhatihi and he is in every place with his knowledge
6382510 it is said we believe that the merciful is established over the throne and we do not know the reality of the meaning of this nor what is meant by it
6382511 it is obligatory to believe that allah is established on the throne while negating any likeness to creation as for saying that his establishment
6382512 whoever believes that allah permeates the heavens and the earth or that he is a body sitting on his throne is a disbeliever even if he thinks he is a muslim
6382513 i am a believer mumin if allah exalted is he so wills inshaallahu taala
6382514 the decision belongs to allah alone la hukma illa lillah the two arbitrators have no power to decide
6382515 we have sold our own selves for the sake of allahs cause sharaina anfusana fillah
6382516 we have traded them in exchange for allahs spiritual reward and his good pleasure
6382517 my lord do not leave upon the earth even one of the unbelievers
6382518 such people are believers muminun to the extent of the faith iman they still possess
6382519 those who commit major sins are neither believers nor unbelievers
6382520 how dare you rebuke me so harshly for the sake of a such a man i saw him in a dream prostrating himself in worship to the sun instead of to allah
6382521 there is no god but allah muhammad is the messenger of allah l a ilaha illallah muhammadun rasulullah

6382554 a vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccine is a promising approach for the development of a new measles vaccine for young children
6382555 although a safe and effective live attenuated commercial measles vaccine is available measles continues to be a major cause of infant mortality
6382556 the immaturity of the immune system coupled with circulating maternal antibodies that interfere with the live attenuated vaccine severely limits vaccine effectiveness during an infants first year the juvenile and infant nonhuman primate studies provide encouragement that vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccination may be able to overcome these obstacles and may provide a viable alternative for infant immunization

6382561 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
6382562 the message isnt clear if ceos think these are the traits they need in the next five years but leaders dont think these are respected
6382563 leaders are focused on the bottom line because that is the message they are hearing loud and clear
6382564 organizations will have empty seats in key leadership roles if they dont begin planning for their future leadership
6382565 these arent good odds for programs that are supposed to increase success
6382566 organizations need to look at how theyre developing those individuals and identify why the failure rate is so high
6382567 were sending leaders into key roles in rapidly growing industries and geographies without the tools they need
6382568 theyre facing new cultures and ambiguous environments without much preparation
6382569 this is truly the bandwidth olympics that we had anticipated with broadcasters requiring added bandwidth to support the high definition television broadcasts as well as the thousands of hours of streaming video broadcasts
6382570 by providing the bandwidth that is enabling this vastly expanded online coverage we expect this olympics to set a new record in terms of the number of online viewers surpassing that of the athens 2004 olympic games add to this the millions of user generated video clips from the audience that are being uploaded on video sharing web sites and it should come as no surprise that this will be the most watched olympics ever
6382571 supporting the communication needs of the olympics was one of the key considerations for landing eac c2c into qingdao
6382572 our next generation network currently supports the broadcast and communications channels across the 37 olympic venues carrying ip based video streams high definition television broadcasts as well as provisioning high speed internet access
6382573 additionally with eac c2c having dual landing points into china we offer the diverse paths and the capacity to provision more capacity if necessary
6382574 the capacity on eac c2c has already lent to the successful broadcast of the opening ceremony of the beijing 2008 olympics on 8 august 2008
6382575 our capacity will also play a critical role in the broadcasting of the closing ceremony on 24 august 2008 which we expect to be just as well watched and hence demand similar capacity requirements
6382576 high video quality longer recording times and low power consumption

6382578 being a classical singer is like being an olympic athlete its a high wire act
6382579 it incorporates every culture and its such a non divisive art form its truly a unique phenomenon

6382581 the key to happiness for everyone is to live your life so you go to the one thing you love thats what music is for me
6382582 you hear jazz everywhere a retail store a restaurant at dinner parties its a universal music
6382583 even though executives at record companies dismiss it as old time music it seems to have a better shelf life and that resonates with me

6382640 as an artist having a show in october im very excited to make use of the intimate spaces that the new gallery provides
6382641 its great to see lyn make such a stellar relocation
6382642 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6382643 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6382644 would you avoid a movie if you knew it contained sexually explicit material
6382645 when was the last time you viewed an adult movie
6382646 you will be asked to view depictions of sexual acts of all varieties vaginal anal oral sex sex with multiple partners ejaculation on the faces of women do you think you could do that
6382647 im not sure how youre used to doing things but here
6382648 this is totally typical for anyone whos ever had one of these cases
6382649 usually it takes two or three days and ive had one take as long as 38 days i think both sides agree this is the way it should happen
6382650 but ive never seen anything like this and ive been practicing criminal law since 1968
6382651 i viewed as many as four or five in the early 90s
6382652 that was back when you had to buy film and a projector
6382653 because its so totally against any belief of mine that people can buy this stuff and watch it
6382654 i dont have anything against pornography and i cant say i would be able to follow your instructions
6382655 that if we excused everyone that felt that this stuff made them uncomfortable we couldnt get an accurate cross section of the community
6382656 it doesnt do any good to say youre sorry after youve already asked the question
6382657 you have both tried to indoctrinate these jurors and you need to stop doing that and start asking questions
6382658 as as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity sexual conduct sexual excitement excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and which taken as a whole does not have serious literary artistic political or scientific value
6382659 told the police investigator that krial had hired him to sell porn and run his staunton store
6382660 hes now told the jury an alleged statement by embrey not subject to cross examination
6382661 but i dont know whats going to happen if you dont have the evidence you say youre going to have
6382662 what is the relationship between what the store looked like on the 29th to what it was on the 15th
6382663 are you going to introduce evidence that the store looked different two weeks later
6382664 if its an accurate portrayal of what the store looked like on the 15th ill allow it
6382665 dont tell me that these movies arent the same type of movie
6382666 who wants to be stared at for four hours while all anyone out there could hear were grunts and groans
6382667 that was the most boring four hours of my life
6382668 it looked like they just hired four hookers and shot it in a warehouse
6382669 the female has no pubic hair no breasts an angular body type typically this is someone whose body has not yet fully developed sexually in most industrialized countries this occurs at the age of 12
6382670 the commonwealth has tried to make this an underage case they have no proof and no good faith basis to allege that any one of these performers is underage and i move for a mistrial
6382671 it speaks for itself that girl is clearly made to look like a child
6382672 this film does appeal to pedophiles pedophiles will buy this film and get off on it
6382673 youre saying shes like a child because she has small breasts i saw these movies every one of these women was shaved
6382674 if your witness makes this sound like a kiddie porn film were going to have a mistrial
6382675 its one fbi agent probably based somewhere near los angeles responsible for monitoring thousands
6382676 ive seen these records theyre photocopies of portuguese drivers licenses and chinese passports that you can barely read the federal government does not track it it is an un enforced law
6382677 removing the penis from the females anus and putting it in the mouth of the female
6382678 just so youre not surprised your honor when the jury comes back in the defense rests
6382679 they didnt prove anything about community standards they just kept harping on this child thing and we thought the jury would be able to sort that out
6382680 you know my father always said matt keep an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out
6382681 the defendants gambled they came into this town and thought no one would care well someone did mr robertson cared and now he gives this case to you
6382682 this country is all about individual rights in a community in 2008 not 1958
6382683 if i put a picture from playboy on a billboard along route 250 that would exceed community standards but if i choose to purchase one of these dvds take it home and watch it in the privacy of my home no reasonable adult would say thats unacceptable under the circumstances
6382684 they collect money for that license if nothing else thats proof that the community accepts this material thats like you getting your drivers license driving home and then when you get there they arrest you because they say youre not allowed to drive what the hecks the license for
6382685 we wanted to punish the city of staunton for licensing this place that wanted to sell dvds without asking what kind of dvds they wanted to sell
6382686 its like if someone wanted to open a tobacco shop i would ask if they were going to sell marijuana so it seemed to us that robertson was under a lot of political pressure to do something about it after the city screwed up
6382687 there was a guy having sex with a girl in her vagina and another guy having sex in her anus
6382688 there were two guys with their penises in the same vagina if were influenced by what we see what do you think that does to a town
6382689 are coming in here and telling you what the community standards are you know what the community standards are
6382690 go buy it where they dont care about morals and decency but dont turn staunton virginia into las vegas
6382691 staunton may be a small light shining in the darkness these days but dont put it out
6382692 and let it maybe be the first domino that reverses this junk
6382693 we the jury on the count of obscenity city girls extreme gangbangs find the defendant rick e krial guilty
6382694 we the jury on the count of obscenity city girls extreme gangbangs find the defendant tinsley william embrey not guilty
6382695 we the jury on the count of obscenity sugar britches find the defendant rick e krial not guilty
6382696 im very happy to be acquitted but i dont agree with the decision
6382697 i do not agree that rick krial or the company are guilty
6382698 but anytime theres one of these decisions it takes a bite out of the first amendment its a lovely town but i would like to think that one day staunton will catch up to what the world is like in 2008
6382699 i do think its interesting that for the first time theres been a sanction of adult material in this community
6382700 that the people of the city of staunton have spoken on behalf of their friends and neighbors and spoken out about how they feel about this stuff
6382701 the jury felt that the tape that didnt contain multiple partners was not obscene
6382702 it seems to me thats a lot of why the jury decided the way they did
6382703 my best guess is they drew a line with sugar britches since it was all one on one
6382704 between two people doing one act and three and four people doing the same act
6382705 a series of gentlemen was performing anal sex on a woman
6382706 and then without cleaning himself or wearing a condom or anything proceeded to have her give him oral sex and they did this six or eight times
6382707 when i was in the navy i saw all kinds of pornography all over the world
6382708 this was beyond anything id seen we figured you couldnt show that to your next door neighbor without him thinking youre some kind of deviant it was the difference between a mountain stream and niagara falls
6382709 and that the jury will find it equally if not more gross
6382710 this constant theme of children children children got through you even heard it in final summation when he was saying this could get in the hands of minors usually thats a depth charge and it means either a mistrial or a reversal it always corrupts a case and ive had judges declare a mistrial for less
6382711 the last chapter in this book has yet to be written
6382712 threatening to arrest christians simply because they have opposing views and choose to exercise their free speech rights at a public place is unconstitutional
6382713 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6382714 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6382715 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6382716 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it the brisbane lawyer said
6382717 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6382718 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves he said

6382721 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6382722 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6382723 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity

6382734 while the pitch is perfectly playable under current conditions we risk causing permanent damage to the surface if several thousand people have access to it at the same time given the amount of rain we have had
6382735 an early decision has been taken because there is the potential for more rain in the next few days and our focus has to be on getting the surface right for the games against glasgow next weekend and then the start of the guinness premiership against leicester
6382736 the open day is a wonderful way to launch the new season at kingsholm and although we considered other options around the stadium access to the pitch is key and we had to take advice from the stadium manager in this instance
6382737 naturally we are very disappointed and we will certainly look at other options once the season has started we hope supporters can understand the decision because of the highly unusual weather conditions
6382738 the launch of our season will now be against glasgow a week on saturday

6382747 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill npws spokesman john dengate said
6382748 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6382749 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6382750 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard mr dengate said
6382751 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6382752 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6382753 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6382754 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6382755 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem mr harrison said
6382756 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6382757 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin mr iemma said
6382758 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and a pod that will care for him mr iemma said
6382759 but it will have a simple elegance already contained in the original design
6382760 weve taken so much time to study the building that it will help us out in the construction phase
6382761 there will be a physical conversion of the building twice a year
6382762 they have had their eyes on that building for many years
6382763 when coran bought the building there were talks with the opera company but everything on everyones wish list was a budget buster
6382764 were all very excited about the prospect of moving to the jefferson and not having to deal with mud and heat
6382765 its just a small basement and crawl space right now
6382766 but it will have a simple elegance already contained in the original design
6382767 we should recall the case of thomas granger the teenage boy who in 1642 became one of the first people to be executed in puritan new england his crime he had physical relations with a turkey

6382769 here was an active child that did not appreciate normal dangers that other children might appreciate
6382770 the cord from the blinds was wrapped round her neck under her neck it was pulling her forward
6382771 you removed the cord and started resuscitation and called billy to get the phone and you dialled 999 and continued to try to revive lucy until the paramedics came and took her off to poole hospital but sadly there was nothing they could do for her
6382772 it would have been possible for lucy to reach the cord and to somehow place her head through it in a manner which would be consistent with the ligature mark around her neck
6382773 i could find no information to make me believe this is anything other than a tragic accident
6382774 lucy was always on the go and into everything not thinking of the consequences of what would happen if she tried something out
6382775 downs syndrome children are very strong in the upper body
6382776 she had tried to get into the water tray she hadnt thought if i put my head in there what is going to happen
6382777 she would just leave her head in there it was a worker that pulled her back
6382778 it has to be the case from the decline in numbers that some young people are focusing their efforts on fewer gcses
6382779 that has been a trend that has been happening since 2003
6382780 perhaps schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity they are recognising that there is no benefit to pupils to do 11 or 12 gcses it is better to have eight or nine good gcses
6382781 the national challenge schools were announced as students were walking into their exams therefore there is absolutely no connection between the national challenge and the improvements schools have made this year
6382782 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6382783 the government must make clear that the schools that have dipped below 30 this year are not failing these schools need to know immediately if they are to be part of the national challenge and if so what additional resources will be available to them

6382787 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6382788 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6382789 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6382790 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6382791 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6382792 cornubia offers a unique opportunity to address the urgent need for affordable housing city building and job creation in the region
6382793 a development of the magnitude envisaged can only be achieved in partnership between the public and private sectors and to this end we have been planning jointly with the city to achieve an optimal outcome this process is continuing as a matter of urgency
6382794 we are not fools we will not threaten our own rates base umhlanga is an important node for us we will not build low cost homes that will impact negatively on the area
6382795 king was being mischievous separating liquidity and funding as i think these things are intertwined he was overstating the issue sending a strong message to the treasury that they should not and could not do anything in the pre budget report
6382796 we are not at all confident of the government taking up crosbys ideas now the plans need to be tried and we think they will work
6382797 we cannot rely on the crosby review thanks to all the divisions coming out the lending industry is like a rabbit caught in the headlights the study will get things moving again and engage politicians and the industry in a much needed debate
6382798 we are soon going to find there will not be enough
6382799 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6382800 the biggest question now is what is going to happen to household energy bills in the future todays news of a key gas pipeline being shut and wholesale gas prices increasing as a result does not augur well for consumers
6382801 unfortunately all the evidence points towards a steady climb upwards for energy bills this will be cold comfort to households this winter
6382802 consumers should look to pay by direct debit and move to an online plan where possible to get the best available prices
6382803 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back
6382804 oh my god ive had a brainwave well get the same green as the
6382805 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6382806 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6382807 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6382808 consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6382809 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back
6382810 at the start ticket sales were very slow but despite this many shows ended up being completely sold out
6382811 my personal highlight has to be last fridays paganini at the lion it was an amazing way to celebrate such an important historical anniversary and there was a great atmosphere
6382812 theres plenty more to come yet for the season including some of our most popular events such as charleys aunt the shrewsbury folk festival and the street festival
6382813 the town residents are now fully aware of the summer season and are particularly thrilled with free events such as the music at st chads church and the teenage kicks at the quarry
6382814 this years festival has arguably been the most successful so far it will be the longest that weve run for and the response weve had this year has been very positive
6382815 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6382816 the biggest question now is what is going to happen to household energy bills in the future todays news of a key gas pipeline being shut and wholesale gas prices increasing as a result does not augur well for consumers

6382820 we rocked our spirits were high we kept up a good pace and we never really got down
6382821 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6382822 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas

6382838 okay pencil me in at 10 so should i still go to the training
6382839 ysgol bryn alyn and mr and mrs owen are justifiably proud of the way that craig approached his schooling and in particular this summers gcse results
6382840 the actual results show that craig was a bright and dedicated student who worked at the highest level

6382921 india is a perfect destination for holiday autos to expand its car hire programme in to the country is an emerging tourism destination while is also establishing itself as a major business centre
6382922 the chauffer driven aspect of the car hire is the icing on the cake for tourists who have an expert both in the quickest and most interesting journeys and somebody who is available to share their detailed and first hand experience of indias history and culture
6382923 this is the way its always been done in these communities they see good discipline as a way of getting a good education
6382924 some educators like it because its quick and its cheap
6382925 it creates a violent and chaotic environment where students learn that people bigger than them can use violence to lash out students become angry after they become hit and they want to take it out on their teachers
6382926 many of the people i interviewed felt there was a link between corporal punishment and slavery
6382927 the instruments used and the position of the child during the beatings are designed to cause pain and humiliation to the child this combined with the fact that blows are administered by mostly male school officials who are supposed to set an example lead to an atmosphere of humiliation violence and degradation this atmosphere in some cases tinged with sexual undertones as when teenage girls are paddled by men is not conducive to creating a learning environment characterized by safety and mutual respect

6382934 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6382935 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6382936 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
6382937 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days

6383017 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6383018 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6383019 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6383020 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6383021 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6383022 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
6383023 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6383024 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6383025 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6383026 this elusive species is a good indicator of forest health large cats need prey and the prey deer macaques and bearded pigs need the forest
6383027 the clouded leopard is the largest predator on borneo there are no tigers having the islands top predator surviving in an ex logging concession hopefully means that the species is resilient
6383028 with more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range and possible range overlap with the smaller cats

6383061 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6383062 the snp has a strong social conscience which is very scottish in itself
6383063 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
6383064 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6383065 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6383066 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6383067 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6383068 there is no minister no deputy minister only the name plaques are here they have all gone to campaign at permatang pauh this is an embarrassment for the barisan nasional
6383069 he does not know anything on tourism matters how could you get him to answer
6383070 billboards with pictures of the prime minister deputy prime minister and azalina are part of efforts to promote the country to local and foreign tourists
6383071 no one had said the pictures had resulted in any negative effects but we have no problem in conducting a scientific study on this matter
6383072 why spend money to fly him all the way to penang when the ceremony can be held in kuala lumpur
6383073 this clearly shows improper use of government facilities for political purposes is the deputy prime minister using the base for campaign purpose
6383074 though government has set up a committee to manage the oil so that the benefits become a blessing to the entire nation i plead with you to let your people educate themselves well to take higher posts in the oil industry
6383075 ours will never be like those in the niger delta where there is always chaos in that oil rich state of nigeria
6383076 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt
6383077 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
6383078 to be fair its a small minority that really dont like the art style
6383079 a majority of the feedback weve gotten has been overwhelmingly positive about the art style i think when they see the final game theyll find its probably a bit darker than they might think what weve shown is the earliest parts of the game meant to be a little sunnier and brighter than the later because were trying to set a juxtaposition and make everything feel worse as the game move on in terms of the actual art style we went through three full art revisions where we essentially hit the reset button on all the art and started over again and one of the main reasons was when we tried to go towards what our memory of diablo ii was we found that it created a drab boring game that didnt play very well
6383080 a lot of people i think would say thats a hallmark of the diablo series the potion system
6383081 it doesnt make it play like a better action game it just kind of gives the player infinite health its actually a fairly poor recovery mechanic because it forces the designers to design monsters that have to deal with a player that has infinite health the only thing you can do is have monsters that can overcome that health and essentially one shot you thats not a very interesting monster its actually a horrible monster but thats the only option the design shoehorned the designers into that kind of monster design so we focused on a health system that actually forces the player to think tactically to recover health from monsters and to put them in some situations where they are low on health but have to walk into an enemy encounter anyway that makes for a much more challenging encounter but it also makes for a situation where we can design the monsters to be a lot more interesting we actually can lower damage on monsters we want monsters to do less damage because we want them to wear you down over time and do things that are challenging in different ways
6383082 the one really great thing that most people wouldnt argue with was the grid based system allowed for very large icons which made the items feel better so one of the things we dont like about the current inventory is the icons are smaller than wed like them to be so were working on sizing up the icons themselves to be very large much larger than say world of warcraft weve experimented with other things like having different bag types hold different kinds of items like big items go into this bag and small items go into this bag but we havent really settled on anything like that what we dont want is the grid based tetris sort of system
6383083 because of fear of prosecution the npp is finding means to rig the elections
6383084 increased corruption devastated the economy and led ghanaians to wallow in extreme poverty
6383085 this is our last hope and if we refuse to vote the npp out of power we would all continue to wallow in abject poverty
6383086 ilo convention 158 specifically requires the employer to provide valid reasons why he is terminating the employment of a worker
6383087 this practice is the18th century economistic principle which allows workers employment to be terminated at will without giving reason

6383089 joojo gyimah returned to ghana about five months ago and met one asare from the brong ahafo region who supplied him with the exhibits to be taken to barcelona spain for a fee of 2000
6383090 we are sleeping in a globalised economy which is moving from resource to knowledge base which requires reading of books
6383091 ghana is sleeping compared to countries like gabon seychelles south africa and kenya which have either 80 per cent literacy rate or higher
6383092 there are teams of psychosocial workers to help the victims in a difficult moment
6383093 everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities at this difficult time
6383094 spanair is doing everything possible to assist the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6383095 is not about sleeping it is about winning the battle and strategizing very much and winning the battle
6383096 government and the central bank are committed to keep the economy afloat despite the instability of the oil market and other related challenges
6383097 it is our hope that other banks would also help prepare the country for the impending boom by diversifying their product portfolios
6383098 jyoti structures jsl one of indias leading power t amp d contractors is well placed for strong growth driven by the expected investment surge in the sector large capex outlay 60 addition to fy08 gross block suggests growth would not be hampered by execution issues but a sharp increase in input costs would translate into pressure on margins since 30 of the current order book has no price variation clause withdrawal of plans to raise equity will translate into increased debt and hence higher interest costs buy 12 month target rs 195
6383099 the act or process of being brought together as a unified whole
6383100 fertilizer as a sector which people study is something which not many people dont bother too much about although the announcement which has come is a pleasant surprise but quite a few of the stocks in the sector had moved up ahead of the announcement and the announcement has possible exceeded expectations but i personally feel in terms of valuations at the present level i wouldnt take too much of interest this is not the favorite sector of the market
6383101 this sector always moves up on announcements which happen and in this market where people are too skeptical and people are trying to hold on to the cash considering the reverses which they have suffered in the last 5 6 months i am sure that people would be waiting for the opportunity and definitely fertilizer is not one sector which is going to excite many so considering where the valuations they are not all that attractive despite the announcements being positive and considering the fact that those stocks had run up too sharply i personally would not advise to buying the stocks at present level
6383102 we have valued the stock using dcf model and arrived at a target price of rs 182 although itc has proved its expertise in the cigarettes hotels paper and agri businesses it is yet to convert the noncigarette fmcg business into profits hence we reiterate our hold rating on the stock

6383112 both sides have reached the conclusion that there is no need for any further negotiations a draft agreement is there it is now a political decision
6383113 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6383114 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge

6383163 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6383164 it really demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife
6383165 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken 100 years to get from the balustrade to the house were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6383166 discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6383167 there has been no room for fun and games for us this week no olympic paraphernalia no mucking around when other people have won medals we have been full on all week
6383168 were going to get in the house and shut the door behind us
6383169 and then we are going to do a little bit of partying
6383170 good people who are driven to win you start with talented athletes then put behind them a team of people to support and allow them to perform at their best and you need a budget
6383171 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable

6383175 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6383176 thats why i will set out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6383177 i bought an electric moped which i think is the technology of the future i got rid of the leaders car shortly after i got in
6383178 something very big is going on particularly in urban britain
6383179 out of the 30 british cities we now lead 12 that has been going on for years that is where the great battlegrounds will be between ourselves and labour at the next general election there are a lot of seats up for grabs in those areas
6383180 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6383181 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag
6383182 its absolutely fantastic im over the moon with the medals and the gold for the stars is the icing on the cake
6383183 its a huge relief that weve actually managed to deliver against our target im really pleased that great britain is having a fantastic olympic games and were playing our part in that
6383184 were working hard to try to keep up with my good mate dave brailsford and all of the cyclists and david tanner and the rowing team
6383185 theyve done a pretty good job i think and the other sports are making a sterling effort and britain is getting stronger and stronger in all its sports moving towards 2012
6383186 the question now is what we are going to do moving towards 2012 with the british team across all sports and thats certainly going to be a very interesting discussion when we get home
6383187 they gelled brilliantly with brian eno and recorded much more music than they could fit on one album

6383194 british swimmers should start believing in themselves and realise they can compete with anyone in the world
6383195 if youd said wed win six medals coming in here id have taken that but these things dont happen overnight this all started in 2001 under bill sweetenham and its been a good progression success breeds success and builds momentum once people start moving forwards they start to believe
6383196 its a positive step forward but weve got a long way to go and theres no reason to relax
6383197 we cant sit back and say were the top european nation theres still a lot of hard work to do to ensure were competitive again in 2012 everything we do has to be geared towards making sure we peak in london
6383198 we have benefited from a strong revenue environment which was supported by major investments in customer service and product the result was further underpinned by sustained efforts to improve efficiency
6383199 our results were also due to the hard work and commitment of our employees and i thank them for the contribution they made to the companys success
6383200 in recognition of this contribution the board has approved the awarding of 1 000 worth of shares and a cash bonus of 1 000 to all eligible staff
6383201 geoff and his senior executive team have done an outstanding job making qantas stronger during events which have challenged the industry and changed its fundamentals
6383202 he has also been working closely with chief executive officer designate alan joyce in the lead up to the transition at the end of november
6383203 our significant investment in product and service has ensured qantas customer satisfaction levels remain high
6383204 this has been reconfirmed by our performance in the 2008 skytrax world airline awards where qantas was ranked the worlds number three airline out of a field of more than 160 carriers
6383205 jetstar having been named airline of the year in the low cost category in 2007 was placed third this year
6383206 qantas new 10 million customer service centre of excellence will open by the end of the year offering enhanced customer service training for 18 000 frontline staff and management
6383207 the program is critical to our strategy and to our ability to compete successfully in the international market to this end we are targeting to achieve further cumulative savings of 1 5 billion by june 2010
6383208 this is in line with our announcement last year that we would position our portfolio businesses for greater growth and diversity outside their traditional aviation areas and provide alternative ownership options
6383209 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions
6383210 this serious incident which remains the subject of official investigations was superbly handled by the aircrafts flight and cabin crews
6383211 this event coupled with the impact of the recent industrial dispute with the australian licensed aircraft engineers association caused significant disruption for our passengers and impacted qantas financial and operating performance in recent months
6383212 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned qantas has an unrivalled safety record and safety will always remain our number one priority
6383213 while delivery of these has unfortunately been delayed due to issues with aircraft manufacturers we are ready to take delivery of our first a380 in september and the late 2009 delivery timeframe for our first b787 dreamliner is on track
6383214 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6383215 at current prices our fuel expense will be over 1 6 billion higher in 2008 09 we have hedged 81 per cent of our crude oil price exposure at a worst case all in cost of us 118 a barrel this cover is all in options which will allow qantas to benefit if prices fall
6383216 a large number of airlines have already announced significant financial losses capacity reductions and job losses in the face of record high fuel prices and an economic slowdown
6383217 the strategies we have worked hard to implement over the past few years including the successful two brand strategy the segmentation of our business and the continued focus on costs through the sustainable future program have put us in a strong position to deal with the current challenges
6383218 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares

6383229 the idea of responsibility a social construct that exists in the rules of a society does not exist in the neuronal structures of the brain
6383230 just as optometrists can tell us how much vision a person has 20 20 or 20 40 or 20 200 but cannot tell us when someone is legally blind or has too little vision to drive a school bus so psychiatrists and brain scientists might be able to tell us what someones mental state or brain condition is but cannot tell us without being arbitrary when someone has too little control to be held responsible

6383244 intellicadd if brought to market would have provided substantial direct competition to autocad because it offered compatibility and transferability with autocad generated files and application software features other cad engines do not offer
6383245 the large installed base of autocad users necessitates that any new cad engine developed and offered in the market offer file compatibility and transferability with autocad in order to be an effective competitor

6383260 we are coming to the end of the age of fossil fuels and the dawn of the age of renewables and the greenbird symbolises this historical watershed better than anything else
6383261 cars of the future wont be running on fossil fuels they will be running on renewable sources of energy like the wind
6383262 and with todays technology we can achieve incredible speeds using only wind power
6383263 we wanted to develop a purely technical solution that would deliver ultimate performance from a free and available resource the wind

6383273 wenn ich f r neun tage ins krankenhaus k me m sste ich von meinen 175 euro 90 euro eigenanteil zahlen das wird wirklich schwierig und ist eigentlich unzumutbar
6383274 nat rlich die 90 euro eigenanteil sind ja auch die maximale obergrenze
6383275 die cdu wollte eine h here grenze das hat die spd verhindern k nnen
6383276 die 90 euro m gen schmerzlich sein aber ich erinnere an die amerikanischen verh ltnisse wo 40 millionen menschen ohne jede krankenversicherung sind

6383278 avevo disputato una grande stagione con gli azzurri culminata con la promozione in serie a dopo parecchi anni avevo una gran voglia di far bene anche in un campionato molto pi difficile della serie cadetta ma una sera mi chiam il mio procuratore dicendomi che la societ mi avevano venduto al torino per circa 8 miliardi fu una doccia gelata lasciare la piazza e il calore di napoli stato difficilissimo per me resto nella storia azzurra al pari con sallustro per il maggior numero di reti siglate in una stagione una gioia immensa che porter con me per sempre sar per sempre legato alla maglia azzurra
6383279 certo il rammarico grande perch quella squadra si era amalgamata benissimo senza cambiare tecnico e senza rivoluzionare completamente tutto lo staff sia dirigenziale sia il parco giocatori quel napoli sicuramente non sarebbe sceso in serie b subito
6383280 secondo me ora completo sono state apportate le modifiche necessarie lo scorso anno zalayeta e lavezzi gi avevano fatto vedere di essere attaccanti di spessore ora con gli inserimenti di denis e russotto credo che il puzzle sia completo ritengo ci sia il giusto mix di forza concretezza e imprevedibilit che fanno si che la squadra di reja possa facilmente piazzarsi alle spalle delle big
6383281 partendo dal fatto che sono per la linea per i giovani non ritengo sia unutopia che vitale possa fare bene in questo campionato ha tutte le qualit per imporsi c da vedere per come il giocatore sappia sopportare le pressioni della piazza che essendo affamata di calcio sempre molto esigente se dovesse partita dopo partita acquisire sempre pi fiducia credo diventer la sorpresa degli azzurri
6383282 sicuramente juve e milan sono attrezzate meglio ma lentusiasmo dei tifosi napoletani potrebbe sopperire ad una leggera mancanza tecnica quindi credo gli azzurri siano nettamente favoriti dal fattore ambientale
6383283 il calcio cambiato ci sono pochissimi giocatori che possono risolvere le partite da soli per esperienza personale sono rimasto stupefatto dalle giocate di zidane che per me tra i cinque giocatori pi forti della storia del calcio
6383284 il gol pi bello lho siglato nel derby vicenza verona cross dalla trequarti e conclusione allincrocio lapoteosi invece il pi emozionante sicuramente quello della promozione in a con gli azzurri a pistoia allo stadio toscano cerano circa 6000 tifosi azzurri un emozione incredibile solo se ci penso mi vengono i brividi

6383288 bahkan saat ini bukan hanya rokok tapi juga sms short message service jadi 2 hal ini menjadi konsumsi besar kelompok rumah tangga miskin
6383289 memang kenaikkan tarif cukai ini berdampak dari sisi kesehatan karena akan mengurangi konsumsi rokok dari rumah tangga miskin tapi pemerintah juga melihatnya dari sisi apbn dan penyerapan tenaga kerja
6383290 jadi perubahan kebijakan tarif cukai tersebut harus dilihat dari banyak dimensi ekonomi yang ada
6383291 tarif cukai tembakau kita saat ini paling rendah dibandingkan negara lain jika dinaikkan maka ini akan mengurangi konsumsi rokok dan mengendalikan distribusi produk tembakau karena berakibat buruk bagi kesehatan
6383292 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill npws spokesman john dengate said
6383293 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6383294 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6383295 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard mr dengate said
6383296 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6383297 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6383298 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6383299 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6383300 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem mr harrison said
6383301 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6383302 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin mr iemma said
6383303 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and a pod that will care for him mr iemma said
6383304 wir sollten als u 23 turnier weitermachen es aber in den internationalen kalender integrieren
6383305 es w re eine gute entscheidung zu sagen spieler sind unter 23 ende punkt

6383310 a time comes in your life when you finally get it
6383311 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
6383312 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6383313 the plane was all broken up all full of bodies nothing remains that looks like a plane
6383314 its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you i dont want to tell you
6383315 its the most like hell ive ever seen the bodies were boiling we were burned trying to remove them
6383316 we are not aware of any australians on board at this stage but we are still liaising with hospitals local authorities and airlines to find out if any australians have been affected
6383317 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6383318 today i wasnt quite ready for the race even though we had all day to get ready
6383319 its probably just the rain and everything we probably werent right on the game
6383320 it probably showed getting a third in the semi as well but for tomorrow and saturdays final ill make sure im ready
6383321 as soon as your legs blow up basically the rest of your body blows up afterwards
6383322 so in the last 100 metres or so 150 metres i started to seize up a little bit which wasnt too good but im quite sure thats just the warming up factor
6383323 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6383324 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6383330 er spielt taktisch einen guten ball vor allem in der spielaufl sung mit flachen b llen nach vorne
6383331 wenn er auf dem niveau weiter spielt wird er noch viele l nderspiele machen

6383344 f r ihn beginnt jetzt die phase in der er angreifen muss
6383345 von einigen muss jetzt der n chste schritt kommen ich habe mit ein paar spielern in den tagen vor dem spiel gesprochen und ihnen das klar gemacht
6383346 das war ein gutes warm up f r die anstehende wm qualifikation ich habe einige erkenntnisse gewonnen einige spieler die zum ersten mal gespielt haben oder in der hinteren reihe gestanden hatten haben ihre sache sehr gut gemacht
6383347 ich denke wir haben insgesamt schon ganz gut gespielt f r das erste spiel und daf r dass wir noch keinen richtigen rhythmus haben
6383348 f r piotr war dieses spiel sehr wichtig er hat ja bei der em keine sekunde gespielt das war sicherlich eine entt uschung f r ihn
6383349 er hat im training tolle dinge drauf die muss er jetzt auch im spiel auf den rasen bringen
6383350 im spiel bekommt man das gar nicht so mit aber offenbar waren wir links doch einiges st rker als auf der rechten seite das muss jetzt aber nichts hei en
6383351 einige spieler m ssen darauf dr ngen jetzt in die mannschaft zu kommen es ist einfach so dass ich den konkurrenzkampf sehen m chte

6383356 des entreprises ont essay de cacher le dif parce quil y a une forme de crainte au niveau du financement

6383359 on constate une d dramatisation des choses du c t des employeurs
6383360 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6383361 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6383364 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6383365 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6383366 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win

6383370 how would you like getting teamed up with people who can literally have you turning massive profits in as little as 7 days even if you have never earned a single dime online in your life
6383371 das grundproblem ist sicherlich dass in athen 2004 die leistungsbilanz entt uschend war und man daraufhin die mittel gek rzt hat
6383372 mit weniger geld k nnen sie nur sehr schlecht bessere leistungen produzieren
6383373 zu lange bis die verbesserungen die beschlossen sind auch materiell umgesetzt werden
6383374 dass es schwer f llt sich auf ein solches ereignis genau so vorzubereiten wie wir uns das w nschen

6383381 in vielen mobilfunk bersichten werden eher die anbieter der ersten stunde oder die mit einem gro en kundenstamm ber cksichtigt doch auch anbieter wie penny mobil oder ja mobil die erst sp ter auf den markt gekommen sind und mit weniger werbung arbeiten warten mit vergleichbaren konditionen auf
6383382 entscheidet sich der nutzer f r ein produkt wie viva mobile bei dem sms und mms sehr g nstig sind muss er sich auch der deutlich teureren minutenpreise von 18 cent ins festnetz bewusst sein diese liegen leider so gar nicht auf schn ppchenniveau

6383390 and we know a huge amount about hendra virus in fact we are recognised internationally as leaders in this area
6383391 there is also the potential i suppose where there is a combined nipah virus hendra virus vaccine because they are closely related viruses and that other virus is causing significant problems overseas

6383476 some of these very creative ideas will undoubtedly enable scientists to explore visualize and expose the meaning contained within biological journal articles more thoroughly and effectively providing better accessibility to the underlying data contained within research papers this grand challenge will give semantic publishing a kick start to the benefit of everyones research experience
6383477 as one of the judges i was thrilled and inspired to see such a diverse and creative range of proposals for how to make the daily work of scientists easier and more productive we await the semi finalists presentations in december with bated breath
6383478 the semi finalists will be given access to more than half a million life science articles including their images and supplementary files in order to build their tool
6383479 access to such a large and diverse body of work will give them the opportunity to scale up their ideas and really test them to see if they can make something that will change the way life scientists read write visualize even think about data

6383481 so far our fluorescent sensor technology has been used in blood diagnostic cassettes worldwide if for example you have an accident and need blood an ambulance crew can analyse your blood at the scene and tell the a amp e unit to arrange for a certain type of blood with the necessary salt levels ready at the hospital for your arrival
6383482 now we have extended our sensor designs and discovered other possible uses one such use could be as an id tag for cells in an epidemic such as a bird flu outbreak from a population our sensor molecules could help track infection and highlight vulnerable people
6383483 also as logic gates are what drive current computers molecular versions of these gates open very interesting possibilities
6383484 it is exciting to think that these tiny molecules can perform small scale computational operations in spaces where semiconductors cannot go in spite of all their power

6383492 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6383493 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6383494 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me

6383500 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6383501 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of war
6383502 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalises stress functioning
6383503 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6383513 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6383514 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6383515 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6383516 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6383517 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6383518 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
6383519 complete revolution in the new green sustainable energy sources that we use
6383520 our housing stock produces about 27 of our carbon emissions we can do so much more to be efficient in the way we use energy
6383521 net effect up to 2050 would be that we become once again net exporters
6383522 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6383523 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6383524 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and that we are overdependent as many people now realise because of the crisis in georgia on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable
6383525 i think it is a question of political will if we have been able to put a man on the moon been able to create the welfare state we could revolutionise the way in which we produce energy

6383537 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere noons management wont even return our calls
6383538 i dont understand it this fight on cbs is maximum exposure and the opportunity for maximum sponsorship dollars way more than he could make on showtime at this point i question his management
6383539 for some reason his camp is not coming straight out and saying no but they are making it very difficult to make it happen his manager doesnt want us talking to him directly who knows what k j even knows about the situation but his management is holding us hostage

6383560 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6383561 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6383562 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6383563 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6383564 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6383574 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working in addition to a decline in the overall number of fatalities the rate for 2007 declined to 3 7 fatalities per 100 000 workers this is the lowest fatality rate in recorded osha history
6383575 those employees working inside the building were in danger of being struck by collapsing sections of its roof walls and framing members while those employees shoveling snow and ice atop the pitched roof lacked protection against falls of up to 22 feet

6383577 employers must remain dedicated to keeping the workplace safe and healthful or face close osha scrutiny

6383581 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6383582 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6383583 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system

6383643 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
6383644 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
6383645 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
6383646 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
6383647 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
6383648 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
6383649 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
6383650 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
6383651 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
6383652 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
6383653 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
6383654 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
6383655 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
6383656 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc
6383657 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
6383658 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
6383659 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
6383660 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
6383661 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
6383662 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
6383663 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors
6383664 i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond

6383666 penn is quick to point out that a micro trend is not merely a development like the increased use of debit cards or wives changing their surnames upon marriage but a growing interest group with needs and desires which are unmet by the corporate or political environment

6383685 we are bringing a couple of young blokes back to give them a really good experience against a really good team
6383686 collingwood have got a few young guys in as well so i think it will be a snapshot of the future
6383687 it will probably give you a bit of a feel for both teams and their younger players and how both teams are going to look three or four years from now
6383688 the way the game has opened up a bit with the rules and things like that i think every team is probably having a lot more trouble this year defending than in previous seasons
6383689 but certainly leo brings a lot of confidence back he is a very good player
6383690 it would be silly to do the same thing over and over again and get the same result we have to do things differently which we will
6383691 this is a lot different market to melbourne weve got pressure on us to be competitive every single year and we understand that
6383692 we will make some changes at the end of the season but they wont be as dramatic as what probably people think they should be

6383705 mengerahkan segala kemampuan baik materi atau bahkan nyawa kita untuk membela agama allah dan melawan musuh allah dan rasul nya
6383706 musuh sudah jelas walaupun tidak tampak yaitu syaithan jalan sudah ada yaitu jihad saya akan mulai dengan berniat lillaahi taala sebab amal perbuatan akan sia sia di mata allah jika tidak dilandasi dengan niat yang benar innamal amalu bin niyyaat

6383714 supaya publik tahu bahwa selama ini memang penyuapan sudah bagian dari cara kerja bpk di lapangan ketika mengaudit
6383715 kpk harus menuntaskan kasus tersebut agar tidak terjadi bola liar
6383716 ketegasan penuntasan kasus tersebut sangat penting demi penegakan hukum dan demi hukum yang berkeadilan
6383717 bagaimanapun nama miranda sudah disebut dan jangan sampai ada bola liar karena semakin tidak jelas masyarakat semakin curiga
6383718 ini semua agar masyarakat masih percaya pada penegakan hukum di indonesia

6383722 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6383723 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6383724 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6383725 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage

6383740 i thought it was possible to beat her as long as i was full of confidence because shes a defensive player
6383741 they must be positive and have belief in their abilities against whatever opposition they come up against even if they are playing against 11 messis or maradonas they must believe they can win after all it is just 11 players versus 11 players on the field of play
6383742 one luck they have is that the mood of their win against belgium would have boosted their confidence which is a good omen for the final game
6383743 this may sound strange but i can tell you that even they argentina are afraid of us the way we play our football is different from most other countries

6383874 i think acre is a very significant addition to farm policy particularly at this point in time because it is designed to help farmers manage the risk they now face
6383875 when i talk to farmers i get this very conflicted statement from them im both excited and scared
6383876 the traditional suite of farm programs assumes it knows we will have chronically high farm surpluses and low farm prices if prices get low enough they trigger a payment
6383877 acre is a revenue price times yield program not a price program more importantly acre does not presume what the market is going to be it just follows the market if prices or yields decline dramatically acre provides support given the market conditions we are in at the time
6383878 its conceptually a fundamentally different program both acre and traditional programs are risk management programs but they manage different kinds of risk traditional programs help manage the risk of chronic low prices acre helps manage the risk of a decline in revenue over the short period of a few years producers need to understand that they cant look at acre through the same eyes they looked at traditional programs and that will be a real challenge
6383879 if you choose acre for corn you must also choose it for wheat and soybeans however this is not a whole farm situation in terms of calculating payment
6383880 acres payment calculation is specific to an individual crop a farmer can receive a payment for corn but not for soybeans
6383881 you are going to give up 20 percent of your direct payments if you choose acre for most corn and soybean farmers that is going to be 2 to 6 an acre per year you are giving up
6383882 i think that the central question that every producer is going to have to answer is is this 20 percent reduction in direct payments more than compensated for by the improved management of risk that acre provides relative to the countercyclical program in todays market of high and volatile prices
6383883 farmers are used to put options on prices this program establishes a put option on state revenue the value at which the revenue put option is established which is acres state revenue guarantee equals the following calculation 90 percent times the 2 year moving average of u s market year price times the 5 year olympic moving average of state yield the use of moving averages of yield and price is why the acre revenue guarantee moves with the market
6383884 current programs do not require that an individual farmer experience a loss farmers can receive a counter cyclical payment and still have record revenue thats not going to happen under acre
6383885 if prices continue to go up then payments under the traditional suite of programs will be greater than under acre why because you are giving up 20 percent of the direct payments and if prices keep going up acre will never trigger a payment
6383886 on the other hand if prices drop substantively acre payments are likely to be larger acre provides you protection in particular to short steep declines in revenue
6383887 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan

6383895 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6383896 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6383897 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6383898 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the starts we will be okay
6383899 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6383900 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6383901 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6383902 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6383903 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6383904 we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there

6383930 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6383931 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6383932 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6383935 the scale of the failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of increasing dependence on foreign energy sources as north sea oil supplies run down
6383936 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas
6383937 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired
6383938 thats why today i am setting out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon

6383947 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6383948 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6383949 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care

6384011 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6384012 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6384013 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6384014 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6384015 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6384016 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation

6384024 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabratrin induced satiety in these animals
6384025 when we gave gvg they would steadily lose weight and when we took them off gvg they would steadily gain weight
6384026 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6384027 a fairly significant proportion of subjects who are obese suffer from something called binge eating disorders they binge eat based on cues they see a cake they smell a hamburger and they crave and they start to eat one of the great things about this drug is it stops this
6384028 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6384029 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6384031 some of the games have been re fixed for the weekend and others will be played during the week
6384032 we were very disappointed with the weather but there was really nothing we could have done there was two feet of water on omoore park at the weekend so we had to put holes in the wall to let all the water out
6384033 we were sceptical about it but after seeing it in action i have to say that its a wonderful machine
6384034 there is very little we can do if a player wants to go and play aussie rules
6384035 it is like a job to them and we cant do anything about it at all it would be very disappointing to lose a player of his calibre
6384036 we gaan als toernooi verder met spelers onder 23 jaar maar zullen het toernooi op de internationale kalender plaatsen
6384037 teams have more to worry about than the county manager especially teams that are struggling
6384038 the point i have is its more important to get a person of the right calibre there seems to be a terrible rush on getting someone in there should be a more serious thought on this
6384039 you hardly expect a club to headhunt a high profile manager
6384040 but a lot of young players were blooded in the past season liam kearns his backroom and selectors andy shortall and dermot murphy gave a lot of dedication this year
6384041 i would appeal to everyone to get behind this fundraiser
6384042 this will be one of our last fundraisers of the year so its important for us

6384045 this sort of behaviour it is putting entire regions along the murray darling basin on their knees
6384046 but at the moment for the people who are up the top of the basin it is first in best dressed showing no concern for anyone down lower it is un australian
6384047 we are going to be running out of water in the next few weeks there will be water for critical human needs and that is it everyone is starting to get very anxious
6384048 we know river systems dont respect state borders surely in the middle of one of the worst droughts in our history we can get our institutional structure in place to recognise that reality
6384049 the desperate need to accelerate the purchase of environmental water so we can secure the health of those river systems
6384050 we have also committed to working with state governments to co fund the purchase of appropriately located irrigation properties and their water entitlements to enhance environmental outcomes in the northern basin
6384051 public storage facilities had enjoyed inflow and rivers have run at their best for several years providing extended opportunity to harvest water
6384052 which demonstrates the highly variable way that streams can run in queensland
6384053 breaks out into floodplains or alternatively feeds into terminal wetlands resulting in a great loss of this water
6384054 this means that the scope for substantial volume to flow through to the murray is very limited
6384055 we need to implement an interim basin plan within months so that we can start managing this system given the circumstances we currently find ourselves in
6384056 the river systems and the agricultural systems are collapsing and our institutional response needs to match that reality that nature has imposed on us
6384057 we are not really pointing the finger at the irrigators up there you do what you are allowed to do
6384058 water is a shared responsibility if the states cant handle it and cant agree it has got to move to federal control
6384059 we probably did take a fair bit of water in queensland this year simply because the river ran for a long period of time
6384060 towns almost died up here everybody just stopped spending money
6384061 most farms let most of their staff go seven dry years it was past anything anyone could ever believe
6384062 a lot of sorghum and sunflowers and soybeans there is a bit of wheat in now

6384069 i have no words to describe it it is an unbelievable thing it is a very important step and undoubtedly the greatest of my career
6384070 beyond my year loan they have an option to buy and of course they have to observe me
6384071 i think everyone needs to have a long hard look at themselves
6384072 we need to think of what we accomplished last year that was hard work and we cant throw it all away
6384073 against sevilla we played with lethargy and without spark that makes us inferior from the outset
6384074 then against valladolid we had a decent first half but in the second period we made errors that a primera side cannot get away with
6384075 the liga starts now and we cannot go forward with this attitude if we play at a walking pace rather than the way we did last year we wont win at all yes fatigue is normal but all teams have it

6384080 im a huge football person and to have been the chief executive of the fa was a very special thing
6384081 im really proud to have been able to do the job and i think weve moved the organisation on leaps and bounds and thats really important to me
6384082 this has been an absolute privilege to lead an organisation of this status and ill take away a lot of warm memories
6384083 its a very different place from when i took over and i am very proud of that
6384084 if i have a genuine legacy the stadium we were sitting in last night is probably one of the finest in the world
6384085 the respect programme is very special to me i always think in these situations and this sort of job you have an opportunity to make a difference and if i in a very small way can improve behaviour on and off the pitch thatll do for me
6384086 i also think in fabio capello we have got an absolute world class coach
6384087 im a friend of brians and also of the chairman
6384088 on behalf of everyone at the fa i would like to express my sincere thanks to brian for the stability and growth that he has brought to the organisation
6384089 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6384090 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6384091 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6384092 but we will give 110 to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6384093 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6384094 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6384095 i had a lot of touches first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6384096 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6384097 what people have got to realise as well is it is the early days of the season the lads are still getting fit and sharp
6384098 everyone needs to improve we want to win every game as the other games come along i am sure the lads will be a lot fitter and a lot sharper so we shouldnt have a problem
6384099 the manager said it was another step forward we know we have to improve we are going to improve no doubt about that i keep saying it is early in the season we have played only one league game

6384152 alles in der ddr war durch angst untermauert noch heute tr ume ich manchmal dass ich unschuldig ins gef ngnis komme
6384153 ihre vertreter sind mir unsympathisch gysi und lafontaine geb rden sich als starke m nner bleiben dabei unkonkret und populistisch
6384154 das grundproblem ist sicherlich dass in athen 2004 die leistungsbilanz entt uschend war und man daraufhin die mittel gek rzt hat
6384155 mit weniger geld k nnen sie nur sehr schlecht bessere leistungen produzieren
6384156 zu lange bis die verbesserungen die beschlossen sind auch materiell umgesetzt werden
6384157 dass es schwer f llt sich auf ein solches ereignis genau so vorzubereiten wie wir uns das w nschen
6384158 nicht wichtig dass man in peking kontrolliert wird sondern es ist wichtig dass der gesamte trainingsprozess mit kontrollen begeleitet wird

6384175 wir haben eine klare nutzfahrzeug strategie und an der halten wir fest
6384176 in vielen mobilfunk bersichten werden eher die anbieter der ersten stunde oder die mit einem gro en kundenstamm ber cksichtigt doch auch anbieter wie penny mobil oder ja mobil die erst sp ter auf den markt gekommen sind und mit weniger werbung arbeiten warten mit vergleichbaren konditionen auf
6384177 entscheidet sich der nutzer f r ein produkt wie viva mobile bei dem sms und mms sehr g nstig sind muss er sich auch der deutlich teureren minutenpreise von 18 cent ins festnetz bewusst sein diese liegen leider so gar nicht auf schn ppchenniveau
6384178 die angebote von unbekannteren mobilfunkanbietern sind nicht unbedingt f r jeden interessant gem seinen vorlieben sollte sich der nutzer den richtigen tarif raussuchen
6384179 lo m s urgente es acelerar todo el proceso de las autopsias y la identificaci n de los cad veres

6384208 estas cifras reflejan la fortaleza de nuestro modelo empresarial en un periodo complicado para la industria a pesar de que muchos bancos estar an contentos con un crecimiento de beneficios de un 57 esper bamos conseguir unos resultados a n mejores
6384209 el desarrollo empresarial ha sido inferior a lo esperado y todav a no estamos donde quer amos en t rminos de eficacia en ejecuci n y procesos a pesar de ello estamos llevando a cabo una acci n decisiva para asegurarnos que seguiremos mejorando en los pr ximos 12 meses nuestros ltimos nombramientos de directivos confirman nuestro compromiso con este plan

6384213 no es cierto que cobre por encima del precio real
6384214 en m s del 95 de los casos las tarifas son las mismas ya sea porque existe un acuerdo que garantiza que el precio es el mismo que en la web de la compa a a rea o bien porque se compra directamente a trav s de la p gina de la compa a a rea

6384228 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6384229 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6384230 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6384231 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires

6384233 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s it is different in that bolt has a bigger edge than owens in his finals
6384234 bolt in a way if he maintains that in the future will bring a mark like jesse owens
6384235 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6384236 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6384237 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is catch me if you can you dont do that
6384238 do not forget that he is still young he is a young man bolt will learn that sooner or later he is a great athlete of course
6384239 the list of the exhibits used by the accused includes a cutlass with blood stains one hammer a green rope an electric wire and one electric stove
6384240 that will also allow the accused person to bring his counsel to the court if he has any
6384241 i think the less said about asbestos the better off we are
6384242 very decent about not reprinting the english articles which substantiated the health hazards of asbestos exposure
6384243 starting with a mixture of quartz and asbestos would certainly suggest you have all the ingredients of a first class hazard
6384244 men handling the bags of material should be required to wear the respirators approved by the bureau of mines
6384245 we know that you will never lose sight of the fact that perhaps the greatest hazard in our plant is men handling asbestos because just as certain as death and taxes is the fact that if you inhaled asbestos dust you get asbestosis
6384246 it is great news that the number of students passing their gcses has again increased this is especially welcome following the successes of the a level results last week
6384247 good exam results are vital if our young people are to successfully compete in this increasingly competitive world the world is changing now at such a fast pace and we now rely on technology that hadnt even been heard of ten or fifteen years ago
6384248 i am in the fortunate position of being invited to visit schools and chat to students on a regular basis i am constantly impressed by the quality and depth of the questions they ask about current affairs
6384249 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6384250 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6384251 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6384252 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6384253 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here

6384264 this looks like a statement of fact doesnt it but ask yourself how many chinese people is this person talking about all of them most of them there are a billion chinese how could this person possibly know that they cannot be trusted and of course they cant
6384265 people are often skeptical of statistics and for good reason there are many ways statistics can be used to mislead
6384266 they would have had to go out and actually count some dogs to see how many of them are brown statistics that are not supported with data should not be trusted at all

6384346 we need to rethink our whole approach to preventing teen risk
6384347 adolescents are at an age where they do not have full capacity to control themselves
6384348 as adults we need to do some of the controlling
6384349 i dont believe the problem behind teen risky behavior is a lack of knowledge the programs do a good job in teaching kids the facts
6384350 education alone doesnt slide 22 work it doesnt seem to affect their behavior
6384351 kids will sign drug pledges they really mean that but when they get in a park on a friday night with their friends that pledge is nowhere to be found in their brain structure theyre missing the neurological brakes that adults have
6384352 people look at risk statistics and theyre more or less steady it looks like things arent getting that bad but risk behaviors have been ratcheted down to younger and younger ages
6384353 what the parents may have dealt with at ages 16 and 17 the kids are dealing with at 11 12 and 13
6384354 it is good research for policymakers to consider but we shouldnt infer from this research that all our past efforts have been ineffective
6384355 im not in favor of just doing education but im also not in favor of not doing it either we need to do some of both
6384356 ten years from now the driving age will be higher than it is now the price of cigarettes will increase
6384357 many families with teenagers find it useful to sit down and draw up a contract with their teenagers the contract should include really basic and important rules to provide for the safety of the teenager and the well being of the family and it should state clear consequences for any broken rules
6384358 if im negotiating or contracting with a teen in a parenting role were going look at whats involved with our relationship with our living situation
6384359 by doubting we come to inquiry and by inquiry we perceive the truth

6384365 for me a form is never something abstract it is always a sign of something it is always a man a bird or something else for me painting is never form for forms sake
6384366 i dont work from drawings or color sketches my painting is direct i want to express my feelings rather than illustrate them when i am painting i have a general notion as to what i am about i can control the flow of paint there is no accident just as there is no beginning and no end

6384375 more likely to be pressured into having sex more likely to get a sexually transmitted disease and more likely to experience an unwanted pregnancy
6384376 there is discrepancy when it comes to willingness to perform oral sex with 22 of sexually active girls say ing their partner never performs oral sex on them while only 5 of boys say their partner never does
6384377 often havent achieved the emotional even neurological maturity necessary for making autonomous and self aware sexual choices
6384378 we tend to focus on the health consequences of having sex like pregnancy and stds but we also need to talk to them about all the emotional consequences
6384379 teenagers are not mature enough to know all the ramifications of what theyre doing
6384380 teens are less prepared to think about if i do this today what will happen to me tomorrow
6384381 at particular risk for experiencing negative social and emotional consequences of having any type of sex
6384382 provided with anticipatory guidance about the mental health risks of these behaviors
6384383 early timing of sexual initiation is important for two reasons
6384384 if we are indeed headed as a culture to have a total disconnect between
6384385 the kids dont even look at each other its mechanical dehumanizing
6384386 particularly are suffering from the new regime i e casual sex and are having some lasting problems
6384387 all the experts who talk about teen sexuality maintain that its impossible
6384388 what many teens come to find out on their own even if sexual activity seems casual it often is not
6384389 a casual hookup on a friday night might not feel that way a month down the road
6384390 pretending to say its just sexual and nothing else thats an arbitrary slicing slide 18 up of the intimacy pie its not healthy
6384391 early initiation into sexual behaviors is taking a toll on teens mental health
6384392 to trust or share or know how to disagree and make up
6384393 they dont learn to build that emotional intimacy before they get physically intimate in the long term that develops bad relationship habits they may grow up not knowing how to connect with a partner on an intimate level
6384394 i think they can develop a kind of negative attitude about life in general that things arent that special and they arent that wonderful and whats the big deal about a lifelong commitment and a family commitment
6384395 theyre disappointed probably because they werent mature enough to understand the meaning of it and its kind of made them kind of cold to the idea of commitment in other ways teens believe that oral sex is less risky to their emotional and physical well being than vaginal sex 43 but experts at the university of california do not believe this conclusion is warranted
6384396 if a substantial number of young people are having oral sex as these numbers indicate this is a big concern
6384397 they do so without pleasure usually to please their boyfriend or to avoid the possibility of pregnancy
6384398 7 of youth used alcohol the first time they had sex and 6 used alcohol the most recent time they had sex
6384399 numbs the experience for them making it less embarrassing and less emotionally painful
6384400 who waited longer than average may be developing friendships and relationships that can help protect them from potentially troublesome behaviors as they become young adults
6384401 found a direct relationship between the amount of sexual content children see and their level of sexual activity or their intentions to have sex in the future
6384402 the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control
6384403 teenagers who watch a lot of tv and movies are more likely to accept stereotypical sex roles and to believe that the unusual sexual behavior that is presented on talk shows is realistic
6384404 healthier aspects of human sexuality such as answers to questions about what it means to be a man or a woman when is sexual activity appropriate what a healthy body self image is and how pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease can be prevented
6384405 who were sexually active were much more likely to say they got information about sex from their friends and partners
6384406 that even well intended contraception policies can be self defeating
6384407 even though there does not exist strong evidence that any slide 30 particular abstinence program is effective at delaying sex or reducing sexual behavior one should not conclude that all abstinence programs are ineffective after all programs are diverse fewer than 10 rigorous studies of these programs have been carried out and studies of two programs have provided modestly encouraging results in sum studies of abstinence programs have not produced sufficient evidence to justify their widespread dissemination
6384408 estimated 600 000 to 820 000 men women and children are trafficked across international borders each year approximately 70 percent are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors
6384409 falling short of the mark an international study on the treatment of human trafficking victims
6384410 canada has ignored calls for reform and continues to re traumatize trafficking victims with few exceptions by subjecting them to slide 54 routine deportation and fails to provide even basic support services

6384417 more likely to be pressured into having sex more likely to get a sexually transmitted disease and more likely to experience an unwanted pregnancy
6384418 profound shift in the culture of high school dating and sex
6384419 sexual behaviors and attitudes change from generation to generation but the explosion of sex without meaning or substance signifies more than yet another generations effort to stake its claim by shocking its parents in this case parents often too jaded to be shocked

6384431 an individual may change his behavior especially his social actions either to protect his interests under new external conditions or simply to promote them more effectively under existing conditions
6384432 it is by uttering the same cry pronouncing the same word or performing the same gesture in regard to some object that individuals become and feel themselves to be in unison it is the homogeneity of these movements that makes the group exist
6384433 taking off your hat to escape the heat is different from taking off your hat to satisfy an obligation the former is a regularity and the latter is a norm
6384434 new norms are thought to emerge when costs of compliance with existing norms become too high relative to the rewards
6384435 people will approve of actions that result in positive outcomes for them and disapprove of those that have negative consequences

6384475 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6384476 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6384477 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6384478 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6384479 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6384480 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6384481 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6384482 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6384483 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6384484 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6384485 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6384486 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6384487 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6384488 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction

6384490 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions

6384503 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6384504 the biggest question now is what is going to happen to household energy bills in the future todays news of a key gas pipeline being shut and wholesale gas prices increasing as a result does not augur well for consumers
6384505 unfortunately all the evidence points towards a steady climb upwards for energy bills this will be cold comfort to households this winter
6384506 consumers should look to pay by direct debit and move to an online plan where possible to get the best available prices
6384507 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back

6384520 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6384521 these enormous price hikes will be a huge blow to millions of people already wondering just how theyre going to pay their bills this winter
6384522 we are extremely concerned that the one in three pensioner households likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of the year will feel forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
6384523 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action to ease the pressure on millions of households
6384524 as an emergency measure to help alleviate the problem this winter the government and energy companies should be working together to offer fuel vouchers to the poorest pensioners
6384525 but in order to stand a real chance of helping the poorest pensioners the government must make it mandatory for energy companies to offer social tariffs at the cheapest rates

6384553 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6384554 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6384555 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6384556 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6384557 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6384558 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports

6384626 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6384627 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6384628 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and that we are overdependent as many people now realise because of the crisis in georgia on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable

6384664 non voglio unaltra consulente ti conosco da anni so che nel tuo lavoro sei molto brava ed io pi che mai ho bisogno della tua professionalit tu dici che un progetto nel quale perder io dico che con le idee giuste posso guadagnare bene io ho fiducia nelle tue idee tu devi aver fiducia in me poi se proprio non ne hai allora pensa semplicemente che ho un sacco di soldi da buttare e voglio buttarli in questo modo voglio acquisire quellazienda ristrutturarla e farla tornare vincente sul mercato so che tu puoi aiutarmi in questo ti chiedo solamente di lavorarci su
6384665 non ho cambiato idea andrea sappi questo per me acquistare quellazienda un errore tuttavia se un piano di riorganizzazione che vuoi te lo preparer ma ho bisogno di tempo e soprattutto di entrare in contatto con le persone che lavorano in azienda
6384666 non posso credere che neanche quella consulente sia riuscita a dissuaderti dallacquisto non pu aver dato un parere positivo solo un pazzo lo avrebbe dato e poi adesso devi spiegarmi perch proprio quellimpresa perch non costituirne una nuova costerebbe di meno piuttosto che far fronte a tutti i suoi debiti in essere
6384667 ho preparato un piano di rientro per i debiti mentre per il piano di riorganizzazione ci vorr ancora qualche giorno vorrei fissare un appuntamento se per te va bene domani pomeriggio passo in ufficio da te
6384668 ok ora ho fame che ne dici se ordino una bella pizza e ce la mangiamo tra un discorso e laltro
6384669 a dire il vero questa sera ho la lezione di spinning in palestra quindi preferisco non mangiare non vorrei appesantirmi anzi forse il caso che io vada domani mi aspettano a milano per lavoro quindi possiamo vederci dopodomani se per te va bene intanto do tutto questo materiale alla mia segretaria cos metter in ordine queste cartacce
6384670 ah va bene per mi farebbe piacere passare una serata insieme magari ti cucino qualcosa io una di queste sere
6384671 tu che cucini no via andrea non scherzare e non fare tentativi azzardati non vorrei aver mal di pancia per giorni o peggio essere avvelenata da qualche strana salsa che ti inventeresti per loccasione
6384672 ah e questa la fiducia che hai in me grazie sono veramente lusingato per devo ammettere che in parte i tuoi timori sono giustificati quindi propongo un piano b ordino tutto gi fatto che ne pensi
6384673 cos gi va molto meglio allora mi auto inviter in una di quelle sere nelle quali non avr voglia di cucinare
6384674 ti fanno male tutti questi caff ti rendono nervoso ed a farne le spese poi sono io che lavoro con te
6384675 si si un agnellino spennacchiato se continuerai a mettere il gel nei capelli
6384676 ludo oggi con questi tacchi di dieci centimetri quasi tocchi il cielo con un dito
6384677 buongiorno ludo come vedi senza la mia adorata collaboratrice sono perduto dove hai messo il fascicolo rosso
6384678 ferma sei matta ad alzarti cos di scatto poi tu che soffri di pressione bassa con questo caldo devi stare ancora pi attenta
6384679 certo come potrei dimenticarlo destate succedeva spesso di telefonarti e di non ricevere risposta perch ti eri chiusa in camera con laria condizionata al massimo nel tentativo di rianimarti e tutte le volte il tuo cellulare squillava invano per ore
6384680 non ero lunica a scomparire ogni tanto signorino le ricordo che lei era un maestro in materia di sparizioni ma forse era proprio quello il bello di noi due no quel non farci problemi a vicenda quel vivere ogni cosa come due incoscienti come due ragazzini
6384681 eravamo due ragazzini io in modo particolare ero un immaturo
6384682 eri un immaturo tu sei ancora un immaturo ti ricordo che stiamo lavorando alla ristrutturazione di unazienda solo perch tu sei un immaturo
6384683 ma perch non sei rimasta a casa fuori ci sono quaranta gradi soffri di pressione bassa ed hai alle spalle solo due ore di sonno cos vuoi vincere un nobel per la resistenza oppure vuoi far vincere a me il premio per il miglior accompagnatore allospedale coraggio signorina ora il capo ti ordina di andare a casa farti una bella doccia ed riposarti e se fai la brava stasera ti porto pure la cena che ne pensi
6384684 penso che ho un capo molto gentile e premuroso ma ho ancora da finire alcune cose qui in ufficio pertanto appena avr completato il tutto mi dileguer e per questa sera niente cena voglio semplicemente un letto sul quale dormire fino a domani mattina
6384685 ci tengo alla salute dei bambini che un giorno avr
6384686 non serve arrivare fin sotto al locale e parcheggiare se si trova parcheggio prima perch impazzire nel cercarlo meglio qualche passo in pi a piedi a patto che non piova e che non faccia freddo
6384687 e allora un uomo non pu aver freddo non pu volersi difendere da un mal di gola
6384688 quando ero insieme a roberto lui mi diceva sempre oggi sei qui con me domani non si sa imprevedibile come sei
6384689 una margherita senn ti appesantisci non digerisci e se non digerisci non dormi e ti lamenti per tutta la giornata seguente ho fatto bene
6384690 ok visto che sei qui ed hai arbitrariamente deciso che non devo dormire ti propongo un filmone uno di quei thriller che ti lasciano senza fiato lho preso ieri pomeriggio ed ancora non son riuscita a vederlo ti va
6384691 io non ho minimamente capito chi possa aver rubato i soldi mentre tu sembri gi saperlo confessa hai gi visto questo film non da te non agitarti e rimanere cos calmo attendendo la conclusione del film
6384692 assolutamente no come fai a pensare che possa gi aver visto il film
6384693 semplice ti conosco per anche se ho capito che lo hai gi visto ti punisco per non avermelo detto prima e ti costringo a vederlo fino alla fine ma ti proibisco di dirmi anche una sola parola che possa farmi capire chi sia il furbo
6384694 che ci fa una come te perennemente a dieta sempre attenta alle calorie con del tiramis a casa
6384695 sapevo che saresti venuto e cos prima son passata a prendere il dolce lo facevamo sempre no tu portavi la pizza ed io pensavo al dolce
6384696 ti ho gi risposto ma tu sei sempre alla ricerca delle risposte che pi ti piacciono senza mai accontentarti di quelle che ti vengono date
6384697 d la verit il tuo ultimo uomo stato un avvocato e ti ha lasciato lamaro in bocca ed oggi odi la categoria intera
6384698 ci sono state volte in cui ho desiderato dessere un uomo per poterti stare accanto come non potevo pi fare avrei solo voluto continuare a condividere con te la mia vita in amicizia ora bello averti ritrovato e bello sentire questo abbraccio cos forte
6384699 tu un uomo no per favore sarebbe stato davvero un peccato perch non avrei pi potuto abbracciarti cos stringerti accarezzarti i capelli n tanto meno avrei pi potuto baciarti e coccolarti
6384700 non tremi pi mentre ti bacio un tempo lo facevi
6384701 ed io e te dovevamo essere amici anche questa volta
6384702 e stato bello andrea e stato bello far lamore con te oggi stato diverso perch non mi sento pi la bambina impaurita di qualche anno fa non ho inibizioni dubbi avevo solo il desiderio di star con te solo questo
6384703 non mi va di riprendere un altro aereo possibile che mi debbano sempre fissare gli appuntamenti senza un congruo preavviso cos credono forse che io abbia solo il lavoro a cui pensare credono forse che non abbia una mia vita
6384704 ed io che ti credevo una donna solo lavoro invece hai anche una vita privata eh chiss quanti uomini ti attenderanno a roma dispiaciuti chiss quanti ne fai soffrire
6384705 hezbollah is practicing a calm policy of overture toward the sunni political and religious forces especially since last may against the sunni future movement to save the image the party has developed in the past as an islamic resistance in the arab and muslim world including in the arab gulf jordan egypt saudi arabia and the palestinian territories
6384706 this move didnt come out of the void but after many meetings away from media between representatives of hezbollah and some salafist groups
6384707 but we have some reservations concerning the attack against the sunnis in may

6384718 and have tried to come off them on many occasions only to find myself back to my original dose of 30mg because of the horrible withdrawals i was assured when talked into taking anti depressants in the first place that they were one of the mildest and non addictive so called wonder drugs in modern psychiatry
6384719 this drug has been promoted for years as safe and easy to discontinue
6384720 the fact that it can cause intolerable withdrawal symptoms of the kind that could lead to dependence is enormously important to patients doctors investors and the company dizziness occur in up to 7 of patients according to the the warning also mentions anecdotal reports of agitation sweating and nausea and tells doctors to consider restarting treatment if symptoms become i would say seroxat worked to start with
6384721 i was totally devoid of all human emotions it was so frightening i felt like a wild animal
6384722 i am a seroxat user since 1999 for the last two years i have been dropping doseage with liquid seroxat down to 2 5 ml not able to drop any lower ive tried and ive cried and cried pushing the ugly overpowering thoughts of death once again maybe for the 100th time away from my weak self the thoughts come from nowhere they are just all of a sudden there and so real so overpowering so easy to act upon i know this only through experiance i feel i am not the person i used to be and dont know if i will ever find my old self again i long to be me again i need to be me again you see i have a four year old son who is not living a full life and missing out on so so much because i am his full time parent and caregiver and there is so much i cant give him because ive lost too much of myself physicly emotionally and mentally cant think straight cant remember things cant make decisions cant go out cant wake up dont like bright lights loud noise too many people talking around me sends my head into a twirll cant have a conversation without forgeting what i am talking about need to think about what i shoul d be thinking about i could go on and on and on but im done in now writing this was hard going please excuse any mistakes with spelling maybe gsks top dogs could put a family member each on seroxat even for a short period of time to prove to everyone how safe it is to take and how safe and problem free it is to stop would they be happy to let a family member play russian roulette because thats what taking seroxat is like it might just kill you honestly or is that what they are trying to do goodbye for now
6384723 hello i am sitting herewith tears streaming down my face it has been 11 days since my last seroxat tablet my dosage was 50mg and i have been taking this for two years my reason for stopping i have had severe reactions prob 10 occasions when drinking alcohol i have been told that one minute i am fine and the next it is like a switch going off and i effectively go mad becoming aggressive and generally not a nice person to be around
6384724 del accidente en el que s lo hubo 19 supervivientes
6384725 previsiblemente la semana que viene ser el momento de tener ya un recuerdo manifestado de una forma participada por los representantes de los ciudadanos
6384726 son muchos canarios y sobre todo muchas familias completas algunas familias que incluso con sus ni os como premio de fin de curso hab an viajado a la capital de espa a el pasado lunes para estar diod as y conocer los parques tem ticos
6384727 ahora lofundamental es estar al lado de las v ctimas y los familiares para que no se sientan solos en estos momentos complicados y dif ciles y yavendr un momento en el que la investigaci n tendr que alumbrar cu leshan sido las causas de este tr gico accidente
6384728 como tantas otras personas profundamente consternada por lo ocurrido el alcalde est puntualmente informado de las medidas que hemos adoptado y ma ana estar en madrid compartiendo el dolor de los familiares de las v ctimas
6384729 se sumen a la convocatoria del mediod a del jueves para manifestar su pesar y su dolor ante esta tragedia
6384730 en una tragedia de la magnitud de este tipo pedimos la m xima celeridad porque hay que dar una respuesta mucho m s r pida que en otras circunstancias a todos los afectados y a la sociedad
6384731 que se esclarezcan cuanto antes las circunstancias en las que tuvo lugar este despegue que no se hizo con las suficientes garant as
6384732 nuestra prioridad es la atenci n a las v ctimas tanto a las que est n hospitalizadas como a los familiares y seres queridos que han quedado rotos y traumatizados por esta tragedia
6384733 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6384734 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
6384735 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6384736 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6384737 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6384738 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6384739 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
6384740 from father to son a private life in the public eye
6384741 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6384742 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6384743 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
6384744 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6384745 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6384746 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
6384747 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6384748 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
6384749 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
6384750 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
6384751 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
6384752 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
6384753 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
6384754 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a hip fracture
6384755 we conclude that low serum vitamin d concentrations are associated with an increased risk for hip fracture in community dwelling women the mechanism of association is unclear
6384756 if you dont have adequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
6384757 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
6384758 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
6384759 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
6384760 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements
6384761 seems like a pretty major omission for a service thats specifically aimed at roaming users
6384762 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6384763 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6384764 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6384765 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realise that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6384766 as a former eeo director i have a particular interest in the federal eeo complaint system it is my goal to improve the quality and efficiency of the federal sector process and help to make the federal government a model workplace i look forward to seeing continued improvement in work force diversity and complaint processing
6384767 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6384768 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
6384769 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
6384770 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
6384771 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
6384772 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
6384773 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
6384774 as producers of kcriverfest 2008 eventpros cut costs negotiated contracts with vendors and initiated a very successful media plan they worked with friends of the river kansas city to successfully reinvigorate the festival putting it on a firm footing to continue for years to come
6384775 we are very excited about the prospect of working with eventpros to make each succeeding kcriverfest bigger and better
6384776 eventpros is honored to accept this unprecedented offer from friends of the river
6384777 its gratifying that our work has been embraced by this great organization we are very proud to be their partner in making kcriverfest not only the fourth of july destination of choice but ultimately the premier annual festival in kansas city
6384778 under the direction of festival chairman chris gutierrez the eventpros team is already developing some exciting ideas that will make 2009s fourth of july more memorable for the entire community
6384779 the port authority of kansas city has made berkley park into a fantastic community resource and kcriverfest is a great way to show it off the skys the limit for our next festival
6384780 if the history of the katrina recovery were written today it would be a tragedy far too little progress has been made despite the remarkable effort and ingenuity of the people of the region who are fighting to restore their homes and their lives
6384781 much of the progress has come at the hands of gulf coast residents in spite of significant hurdles placed in front of them by the federal government the next administration must act quickly to remove those hurdles so gulf coast residents can truly and finally recover from the storms
6384782 we had 110 women enrolled in the program last year
6384783 women wishing to ensure themselves a spot in this years workshop should register soon kdwp is grateful to have the best corps of volunteer outdoor skills educators in the state as partners in this program many of them have been with us since the beginning
6384784 because he wants to help win the eastern conference said joel bell ratliffs agent
6384785 because he knows coach maurice cheeks knows the city and believes the team is going to be good bell said
6384786 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players sixers president general manager ed stefanski said in a statement
6384787 this is a great feeling but if it wasnt for the soul organization and the team playing to the level we did this year i probably wouldnt have been noticed
6384788 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6384789 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6384790 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6384791 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6384792 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6384793 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6384794 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6384795 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6384796 what would you think of a man who not only kept an arsenal in his home but was collecting at enormous financial sacrifice a second arsenal to protect the first one what would you say if this man so frightened his neighbors that they in turn were collecting weapons to protect themselves from him what if this man spent ten times as much money on his expensive weapons as he did on the education of his children what if one of his children criticized his hobby and he called that child a traitor and a bum and disowned him and he took another child who obeyed him faithfully and armed that child and sent it out into the world to attack neighbors what would you say about a man who introduces poisons into the water he drinks and the air he breathes what if this man not only is feuding with the people on his block but involves himself in the quarrels of others in distant parts of the city and even in the suburbs such a man would clearly be a paranoid schizophrenic with homicidal tendencies
6384797 every government is run by liars and nothing they say should be believed
6384798 how many does it take to metamorphose wickedness into righteousness one man must not kill if he does it is murder but a state or nation may kill as many as they please and it is not murder only get enough people to agree to it and the butchery of myriads of human beings is perfectly innocent but how many does it take
6384799 an apt and true reply was given to alexander the great by a pirate who had been seized
6384800 practically speaking no government knows any limits to its power except the endurance of the people
6384801 dat maxime zon lieve jongen is maar toch niet zo vlot alles kan en heel weinig of slecht spreekt
6384802 to ending the occupation in iraq and bringing our troops home
6384803 the use of united states armed forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the united states
6384804 we will not cut off funding for the troops absolutely not let me remove all doubt in anyones mind as long as our troops are in harms way democrats will be there to support them
6384805 this is absolute nonsense in truth the history of the conflict is not over occupation and never has been it is over the fundamental right of israel to exist
6384806 israels qualitative military edge will be empirically assessed on an ongoing basis
6384807 ensuring the security of israel and the entire world demands that we do more to convince iran to give up its nuclear ambitions and cease its support for terrorist groups
6384808 thank you for lobby ing on behalf of bipartisan legislation introduced by congressman ackerman
6384809 i took impeachment off the table a long time ago you cant talk about impeachment unless you have the facts and you cant have the facts unless you have cooperation from the administration i think the republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda
6384810 violat ing his constitutional oath to faithfully execute his office
6384811 preserve protect and defend the constitution impos ing a police state and military dictatorship ramming the totalitarian usa patriot act and other repressive legislation through congress trying to suspend the constitutional writ of habeas corpus mass round ing up and incarcrat ing foreigners kangaroo courts depriving at least two united states citizens of their constitutional rights by means of military incarceration interfer ing with the constitutional right of defendants in criminal cases to be represented by lawyers violating and subverting the posse comitatus act allowing unlawful and unreasonable searches and seizures violating the first amendment rights of free exercise of religion speech assembly and to petition the government for redress of grievances packing the federal judiciary with hand picked totalitarian minded judges violating the third and fourth geneva conventions us war crimes act un convention against torture the universal declaration of human rights
6384812 to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the united states
6384813 expedited path to legalization in the form of green cards
6384814 terrorize immigrant workers driven here by bipartisan support for unfair free trade and structural adjustment policies
6384815 basic human right from infants in day care centers to students in universities
6384816 bring ing home our troops from all countries where they promote occupation corporate greed and empire
6384817 corporate profiteers to avoid proper oversight and health and safety regulations reinstating glass steagall that separated investment from commercial banking and insurance operations
6384818 multiple ownership of newspaper cable broadcast internet and all other media operations
6384819 privatize and contract out jobs that threat en the nations workforce
6384820 babar i know what you may be thinking but i am glad that you are walking with me slow as the world dont stop for slow movers
6384821 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6384822 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6384823 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6384824 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6384825 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6384826 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6384827 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6384828 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6384829 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6384830 omdat bij jou nu pas de schellen van de ogen zijn gevallen
6384831 moet daarom nu iedereen die in die jaren actief was verantwoording gaan afleggen
6384832 wij zijn kennelijk niet meer in staat te begrijpen dat dergelijke acties bij een manier van politiek hoorden die eigen was aan links
6384833 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6384834 i thought it was a bit harsh to send the youngster off in the circumstances as the match was a friendly
6384835 the first challenge was enthusiasm thats all and no one was hurt but the referee has made a decision and we have to live with that
6384836 i am just disappointed for the boy because he did extremely well he will remember what happened for the rest of his life
6384837 on the one hand he was delighted to make his senior debut but on the other hand he is hugely disappointed with the decision
6384838 but that is part of being a professional player ryan has an old head on young shoulders so he will deal with this very quickly
6384839 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6384840 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard with the two wide men and david healy playing up on his own he worked his socks off i dont think he has that much match fitness so it was a credit to him
6384841 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land
6384842 i cant say how far well go finland are in the driving seat at the moment
6384843 this was a game that gave us an opportunity to win against slovenia at home and now we have a lot to play for because denmark play finland the next day
6384844 they havent played that many competitive games together some of them only one or two
6384845 some people would say that you must go in and win the ball but if youre against big boys and the deliveries are good then theres nothing you can do about that
6384846 we did really well to cope with the threat that they had
6384847 they are big boys and they had good delivery so they are going to do that they didnt get free headers and we kept them on their toes
6384848 we had a lot of possession and we won the game
6384849 i was delighted with the goals we had good control in the game and great chances you cant really ask for more than that
6384850 james and kenny lacked that little bit of a cutting edge up front when you put a team under pressure at home you need to put the ball in the net but we lacked that edge we needed to win the game
6384851 there is still a lot of work to be done on their partnership but they work hard it takes time for any partnership to form at home we want to play with two up front and put the opposition under pressure
6384852 they both worked their socks off and did well at times we were unfortunate not to get a goal in the second half when james had a point blank effort saved if that goes in we win the game and you say the partnership worked
6384853 to be honest i genuinely didnt expect to be in the squad id been asked during pre season if i was hoping to get back in and i was thinking to myself that i seem to have had the same conversation every pre season
6384854 it had got to the stage i was not expecting anything you just get on with things and thankfully it has come along a bit sooner than i might have hoped
6384855 all i can hope is that i keep up my form for hearts maintain the good start i have had and keep knocking on the door
6384856 the gaffer burley spoke about staking a claim for a shirt if you got that chance to take it so hopefully i have not done myself any harm
6384857 with a new manager if you are in there from the start you are able to maintain that position a lot more easily rather than trying to fight your way in from the outside im grateful that hes obviously been looking at me now theres only one thing i can do concentrate on kicking on from where i have left off with hearts
6384858 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6384859 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6384860 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6384861 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6384862 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6384863 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6384864 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6384865 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6384866 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6384867 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6384868 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6384869 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6384870 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6384871 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6384872 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6384873 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6384874 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6384875 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6384876 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6384877 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6384878 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6384879 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6384880 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6384881 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6384882 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6384883 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6384884 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6384885 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6384886 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6384887 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6384888 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6384889 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6384890 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6384891 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6384892 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6384893 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6384894 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6384895 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6384896 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6384897 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6384898 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6384899 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6384900 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6384901 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6384902 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6384903 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6384904 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6384905 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6384906 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6384907 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6384908 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6384909 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6384910 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6384911 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6384912 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6384916 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6384917 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6384918 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6384919 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6384920 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6384921 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6384922 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6384923 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6384924 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6384925 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6384926 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6384927 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6384928 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6384929 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6384930 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6384931 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6384932 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6384933 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6384934 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6384935 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6384936 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6384937 invisions unique design makes it at amp ts smallest mobile phone to feature mobile tv
6384938 walking around town with live tv in your pocket has never been easier

6384942 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6384943 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6384944 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6384945 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6384946 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6384947 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6384948 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6384949 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6384950 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

6384957 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6384958 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6384959 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6384960 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6384961 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6384962 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6384963 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6384964 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6384965 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6384966 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6384967 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6384968 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6384969 should the woman herself wish to make contact either by herself or through a third party this would be good because we merely need to check that she and her child if indeed one was born is in receipt of appropriate medical care
6384970 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6384971 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6384972 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6384973 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6384974 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6384975 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6384976 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6384977 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6384978 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6384979 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6384980 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6384981 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6384982 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6384983 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6384984 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6384985 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6384986 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6384987 wir sollten als u 23 turnier weitermachen es aber in den internationalen kalender integrieren
6384988 you do not need to spend six years as an apprentice
6384989 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6384990 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6384991 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6384992 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6384993 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6384994 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6384995 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6384996 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6384997 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6384998 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6384999 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6385000 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6385001 they told me there are going to be resources here
6385002 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6385003 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6385004 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6385005 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6385006 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6385007 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6385008 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6385009 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6385010 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6385011 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6385012 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6385013 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6385014 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6385015 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6385016 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6385017 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6385018 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6385019 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6385020 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure

6385025 were trying to get the case submitted to them through the university of cincinnati by tomorrow night if we can were planning on working all night to get this done
6385026 were giving them additional information about the injury itself we have an expert a physician whos going to explain the injury the medical picture
6385027 the ncaas procedures allow for its hearings to be reopened in certain circumstances such as to hear new evidence not previously available
6385028 the ncaas preference is always to explore all possible administrative remedies rather than have a court try to intervene in decisions of its member schools representatives as our member representatives have the expertise and experience to best deal with such situations
6385029 ben is very pleased and very hopeful that they give him a fair shake
6385030 if the staff agrees with us hes back on the field
6385031 were trying to get the case submitted to them through the university of cincinnati by tomorrow night if we can were planning on working all night to get this done

6385040 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6385041 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6385042 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6385043 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6385044 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6385045 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6385046 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6385047 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6385048 its a beautiful day i think ill resign and go fishing
6385049 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
6385050 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6385051 endeavoring to cause prospective defendants to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
6385052 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
6385053 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
6385054 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
6385055 president bush underwrote mr musharrafs dictatorship but says nothing of the example bush himself set including rigging elections as musharraf did
6385056 despite an intensifying squeeze on household budgets the uk consumer is down but by no means out
6385057 by increasing our exposure through this issuance to these new markets where we believe there are plenty of investors as well as businesses that may not be interested in the mtn programme itself but may be interested to collaborate with us to do something else
6385058 in china for instance there are good opportunities that have become available or will become available soon there are property developers over there that may find it no possible to borrow anymore and they are therefore in a position to take in new investors or the creditor bank may persuade them to sell out
6385059 what i want to say to people like me who were oppressed or will be oppressed dont be afraid to speak out or to come out in the open
6385060 let us fight for our rights we are not alone we need to face people who abuse us and our weaknesses because if we do not speak up they will continue to abuse us
6385061 i was not angry about the way you see things
6385062 i heard you say that you were angry at all of humanity and that you dont want me to even question that and i know youre upset and angry it just kind of pressed my buttons i guess i am actually with vocal stress on those three words a human being
6385063 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6385064 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6385065 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6385066 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6385067 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6385068 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon

6385070 we continue to believe apple will need to reposition the ipod touch line in conjunction with its anticipated new product announcement in early to mid september now that the iphone acquisition price is lower

6385076 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6385077 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6385078 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6385079 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6385080 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6385081 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6385082 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6385083 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

6385090 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6385098 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6385099 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6385100 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6385101 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6385102 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6385103 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

6385107 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6385108 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6385109 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6385112 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6385113 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6385114 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6385115 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

6385127 we want to raise awareness in rural communities of how registering land modernises and simplifies existing information reduces the amount of title paperwork and may save time and money in future by reducing the need for legal administration
6385128 we are delighted that 60 of land in wiltshire somerset and dorset is now registered and would urge all other landowners and farmers to think about registering their land
6385129 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6385130 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6385131 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6385132 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6385133 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6385142 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6385143 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6385144 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6385145 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6385146 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6385147 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6385148 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6385149 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6385150 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6385151 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6385152 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6385153 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6385154 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6385155 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6385156 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6385157 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6385158 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6385159 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6385160 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6385161 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6385162 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6385163 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6385164 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6385165 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6385166 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6385167 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6385168 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6385169 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6385170 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6385171 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6385172 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6385173 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6385174 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6385175 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6385176 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6385177 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6385178 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6385179 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6385180 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6385181 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6385182 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6385183 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6385184 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6385185 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6385186 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6385187 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6385188 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6385189 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6385190 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6385191 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6385192 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6385193 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6385194 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6385195 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6385196 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6385197 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6385198 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6385199 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6385200 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6385201 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6385202 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6385203 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6385204 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6385205 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6385206 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6385207 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6385208 one of my mentors once told me that a programming language is just a programming language it doesnt matter if youre a good programmer its the syntax that matters
6385209 were hiring like crazy but were not having an easy time were just looking for attitude and aptitude kids right out of school that know net or even java because with that we can train them on net
6385210 dont get fixated on one or two languages when i started in 1969 fortran cobol and s 360 assembler were the big tickets today java c and visual basic are in 10 years time some new set of languages will be the in thing at last count i knew have learned over 24 different languages in over 30 years
6385211 high speed scripting with caching augmented with compiled code plug ins such as can be done with perl and php is where the future is building web apps from scratch using c or cobol is going the way of the dinosaur
6385212 learning c which is just java with a different name plate is critical if you heavily use microsoft
6385213 the demand for ajax knowledge is huge because its so damned hard to learn
6385214 if microsofts atlas tool is successful it would bring the extreme complexity and annoyance of ajax to the average worker
6385215 learning some form of scripting language such as perl or php is critical if you are doing web apps
6385216 learning c is crucial once you learn c making the jump to java or c is fairly easy because a lot of the syntax is common also a lot of c syntax is used in scripting languages
6385217 it is currently dominating in adoption and that is where all the work is
6385218 like any true fan the new films are dead to me didnt exist never happened
6385219 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina

6385221 if someone comes down to the highcross centre anytime on the day of the launch there will be something going on to see
6385222 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6385223 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6385224 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6385225 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6385226 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6385227 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6385228 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6385229 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

6385231 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6385232 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6385233 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6385234 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6385235 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6385236 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6385237 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6385238 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6385239 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6385240 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6385241 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6385242 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6385243 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6385244 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6385246 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6385247 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6385248 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6385249 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6385250 vouchers for work is a sustainable approach that enables the local community to prioritise the infrastructure needs of their community they participate in rehabilitation by providing labour
6385251 in the beginning it was reasonable to distribute free seeds and tools to idps however as people began to return home it was imperative that sustainable approaches were adopted to ensure that the local communities participate in their own development
6385252 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6385253 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6385254 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6385255 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6385256 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6385257 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6385258 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6385259 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6385260 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6385261 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6385262 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6385263 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6385264 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6385265 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6385266 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6385267 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6385281 this is an example of how the growing market in russia is having a positive impact on the port of gothenburg
6385282 our aim at the port of gothenburg is that within eight years we will be handling twice the volume of goods growth is vital if we are to retain our position as the largest port in the nordic region and if we are to continue to offer the whole of swedish industry good effective sea transport each new agreement is an important step towards achieving this goal
6385283 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6385284 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6385285 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6385286 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6385287 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6385288 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6385292 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6385293 one hundred and forty tibetans are reported to have been killed but the figure needs to be confirmed
6385294 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of tibetan capital lhasa alone
6385295 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families
6385296 just a little bit every day however much you can manage after school
6385297 and dont look so grumpy the days are shorter and shorter
6385298 looks like youre near the center though thats pretty cool
6385299 hard to tell at this angle are they heading for us
6385300 whered they even go i mean really are they just hiding back there until we leave
6385301 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6385302 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6385303 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6385304 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6385305 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

6385313 the bnp is trying to hold a festival of hate we must expose them for what they are nazis who want to repeat the holocaust
6385314 we believe that localised campaigning on broader issues than racism fundamental as racism is is the key to turning back the british national partys electoral advance
6385315 his arms and legs were bound with duct tape behind his back
6385316 we are losing one of the best young boys in our community
6385317 it is heartbreaking i feel as though i lost my own child
6385318 this has happened in at least five stores in our community
6385319 the bulk of the conversation was about public safety and violence in their neighborhoods
6385320 if i had any of my own i would want them to be like him
6385321 its so sad and so unfair because he didnt deserve that
6385322 slave state that fought beside the north thats only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way
6385323 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts without an indian accent
6385324 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6385325 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6385326 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6385327 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6385328 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6385329 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6385330 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6385331 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6385332 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6385333 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6385334 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6385335 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6385336 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6385337 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6385338 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6385339 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6385340 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6385341 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6385342 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6385343 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6385344 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6385345 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6385346 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6385347 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6385348 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6385349 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6385350 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6385351 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6385352 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6385353 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6385354 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6385355 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6385356 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6385357 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6385358 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6385359 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6385360 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6385361 i hope to play as many games as possible and with a smaller squad hopefully therell be more opportunities
6385362 because i havent played at full back for some time especially with the new law variations
6385363 supporting documents relating to this inquiry were deposited in duns library rather than eyemouth library which had been the location agreed at a pre enquiry meeting
6385364 it is unclear at this stage how the mistake happened but we will be looking into this
6385365 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6385366 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6385367 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6385368 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6385369 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6385370 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6385371 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6385372 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6385373 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6385374 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6385375 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6385376 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6385377 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6385378 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6385379 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6385380 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6385381 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6385382 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6385384 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6385385 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6385386 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6385387 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6385388 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6385389 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6385390 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6385391 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6385392 a florida surgeon and fitness freak with a black belt in karate he runs 50 miles a week and flies a cherokee arrow 200
6385393 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6385394 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6385395 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6385396 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6385397 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6385398 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6385399 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6385402 you on the other gt hand are apparently not aware
6385403 im trying to focus down to a specific technical point that we might be able to resolve
6385404 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6385405 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6385406 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6385407 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6385408 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6385409 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6385473 it is evident that the original objective of the partnership which is to address nigeria s energy challenge while guaranteeing germany short and long term energy security has been properly addressed
6385474 while assuring you of the readiness of all relevant federal government functionaries not only to buy into but also to provide the requisite impetus for the process i wish to congratulate all who have contributed to evolving this partnership for a job well done

6385478 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
6385479 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6385480 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
6385481 the military presence in tibet is old but the frenzy of new construction in the amdo and kham regions makes me say that this colonisation by the army is designed to last

6385491 that was just another risk reduction step to prove the aircraft was not leaking fuel and the engines were behaving nominally
6385492 it was a full functional check flight of about 55 minutes
6385493 we asked them point blank if they noticed any difference in performance and they said it was a non event
6385494 in other words they couldnt tell the difference the aircraft behaved the same
6385495 well have two more sorties then the robins engineers will put their final analysis and reports together
6385496 hopefully they will grant us the certification to use the fuel operationally if need be
6385497 weve scheduled an aerial refueling demonstration aug 28 between both aircraft
6385498 both will be flying on the synthetic blend and the kc 135 will be passing it to the f 22 in flight
6385499 were trying to get them through the process as expeditiously and safely as possible we want to prove that our fleet can use a different fuel so that we can encourage industry to develop alternative sources
6385500 the test was very well thought out and very well run by the engineers the maintenance team and the pilots flying the aircraft

6385504 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that

6385509 since genesis has been providing the sd feed for wfn almost from its inception it was logical to use the same fiber network for delivery of the new hd service
6385510 thanks to advancements in global fiber working in concert with the industrys leading edge uplinking and transmission services hd content is becoming available to cable and satellite subscribers with just about any interest from fishing to home improvement

6385524 i thought i knew the marine corps and what they were about

6385602 new version is out remember to read the included documentation if you encounter any problems
6385603 im looking for the good news in the human genome
6385604 headlines for the last 20 years have really been about the triumph of biomedical research in finding disease genes which is biologically interesting genetically important and frightening to people who get this information
6385605 i became obsessed with trying to decide if there is some other class of information that will make people want to look at their genome sequence
6385606 our studies have convinced us that there is a lot of variation in the population in these enzymes and a lot of it affects function and a lot of it is responsive to vitamins
6385607 i wouldnt be surprised if everybody is going to require a different optimal dose of vitamins based on their genetic makeup based upon the kind of variance they are harboring in vitamin dependent enzymes
6385608 our soldiers like top athletes operate under extreme conditions that may well be limited by their physiology
6385609 were now working with the defense department to identify variants of enzymes that are remediable and ultimately hope to identify troops that have these variants and test whether performance can be enhanced by appropriate supplementation
6385610 and more than half interfere with the function of the enzyme producing a hundred fold range of enzyme activity the majority of these can be either partially or completely restored to normal activity by adding more folate and that is a surprise
6385611 in those people supplementation of folate in the diet can reduce levels of that metabolite and reduce disease risk
6385612 there are over 600 human enzymes that use vitamins or minerals as cofactors and this study reports just what we found by studying one of them
6385613 what this means is that even if the odds of an individual having a defect in one gene is low with 600 genes we are all likely to have some mutations that limit one or more of our enzymes
6385614 every individual would harbor approximately 250 deleterious substitutions considering only the low frequency variants these numbers suggest that the aggregate incidence of low frequency variants could have a significant physiological impact
6385615 if you dont give people a reason to become interested in their genome and to become comfortable with their personal genomic information then the benefits of much of the biomedical research which is indexed to particular genetic states wont be embraced in a time frame that most people can benefit from
6385616 so my motivation is partly scientific partly an education project and in some ways a partly political project
6385617 looked at in one way bruce found that you can cure a genetic disease in bacteria by treating it with vitamins
6385618 there should be people who are genetically different in terms of the amount of vitamin needed for optimal performance of their enzymes
6385619 now that we have the complete genome sequences of all the common model organisms including humans its obvious that the defining challenge of biology in the 21st century is not what the genes are but what the variation in the genes does
6385620 that is a new principle that may be applicable to drug design

6385654 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6385655 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6385656 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6385657 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6385661 if you score a good goal and make four or five assists then you havent done a bad job
6385662 its a shame that i cant test that guy against a professional club with real strong defenders he does have specific qualities though and is a player i would love to have in our group
6385663 friendly matches are in the domain of fifa it is not uefas responsibility
6385664 unfortunately this is not a new thing but there are no sanctions we can impose
6385665 we ran a successful campaign during the european championships to get fans to respect their opponents national anthems
6385666 its about education and we can only hope that respect is shown
6385667 the sfa is obviously disappointed that a minority of of our fans chose not to respect the visitors national anthem
6385668 the tartan army have a richly deserved reputation as fantastic ambassadors for their country
6385669 i have a good feeling after the recruitment we have made
6385670 we have everything at our disposal to finish very high up now we must no longer make the same errors we made last week at rennes and continue the way we played in the second half against auxerre
6385671 i hope the championship will be tight until the end it would be good for the public and for french football as a whole
6385672 i spoke with madrid sporting director pedja mijatovic and with madrid president ramon calderon and they told me that robinho has to stay that he cannot leave
6385673 so we cannot do anything because he has two years on his contract with real madrid
6385674 robinho never said that he is not happy at madrid but the fact is that he has a more interesting economic offer thats all
6385675 yes i have to say that until august 31 anything is possible until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed
6385676 it was important to start well with a goal and i managed it so i am happy
6385677 i was also able to score a goal on my debut with fiorentina too
6385678 i want to keep hold of this shirt and not let it go again
6385679 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6385680 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6385681 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6385682 but we will give 110 to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6385683 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6385684 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6385685 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6385686 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6385687 what people have got to realise as well is it is the early days of the season the lads are still getting fit and sharp
6385688 everyone needs to improve we want to win every game as the other games come along i am sure the lads will be a lot fitter and a lot sharper so we shouldnt have a problem
6385689 the manager said it was another step forward we know we have to improve we are going to improve no doubt about that i keep saying it is early in the season we have played only one league game
6385690 at the moment ive only read and heard of these things and up till now theres been nothing official
6385691 until i find out any other information im a torino player
6385692 it was a hard fought triumph but mexico were clearly the superior team
6385693 we played better than the hondurans but had no luck we surely will have more in the next game
6385694 they perhaps didnt play brilliantly today but they are very young
6385695 bearing arms for a lawful purpose is not a right granted by the constitution
6385696 has no other effect than to restrict the power of the national government
6385697 prohibits a state from depriving any person of life liberty of property without due process of law but this adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another
6385698 the act was passed for the purpose of disarming negro laborers it was never intended to be applied to the white population and in practice has never been so applied
6385699 vijay wir befinden uns in der zweiten saisonh lfte was sind die ziele des teams f r diese periode
6385700 das getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung ist unsere letzte weiterentwicklung f r 2008 jetzt schalten wir den fokus ganz auf 2009 um es werden sich trotzdem noch gelegenheiten bieten und wir m ssen diese nutzen force india hat bewiesen dass das team unter rennbedingungen konkurrenzf hig ist und dass wir unter den richtigen umst nden punkte holen k nnen wenn es ein bisschen zu unseren gunsten l uft auf stadtkursen waren wir auch immer stark daher k nnte der letzte saisonabschnitt eine gute gelegenheit f r uns sein wir brauchen eine hundertprozentige zuverl ssigkeitsquote damit wir unsere chancen auch nutzen k nnen
6385701 wie werdet ihr die ressourcen f r 2008 und 2009 aufteilen
6385702 auch wenn 2009 nat rlich eine gro e gelegenheit ist sind auch dieses jahr noch punkte zu vergeben vor uns liegen einige potenziell gute chancen und wenn wir in der konzentration nachlassen k nnten wir einige gute zielank nfte verpassen gleichzeitig werden wir gegen saisonende die arbeiten f r 2009 massiv erh hen damit wir bereit sein werden
6385703 die formel 1 f hrt am kommenden wochenende erstmals in valencia freust du dich schon darauf
6385704 ja nat rlich ich halte valencia f r einen gro artigen schauplatz f r ein rennen ein bisschen wie monaco ich habe die pl ne f r die strecke gesehen und sie sieht so aus als w rde sie durch die neueren teile der stadt f hren ich denke es wird ein tolles bild abgeben wenn die autos im hafen und an den jachten vorbeifahren ganz hnlich wie im f rstentum es wird ein toller event f r das team die fans und die sponsoren

6385710 well since we had some free time on our hands we were thinking why not record some new stuff and put a second album out somewhere around spring 2009 doesnt sound bad does it i know first album was just released and european tour with
6385711 amberian dawn will follow the same path with the second album we are so happy of the feedback what our debut album river of tuoni has received thank you all so much for you support so far 13 songs have their drums and guitars recorded heidi parviainen has done also some vocals still long way to go but better be early than late
6385712 our finnish label suomen musiikki has defined amberian dawn s music as fantasy metal but as always the genre borders are very thin and hard to define our music has definitely fantasy in its lyrics but melody and rhythm are the key components
6385713 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6385714 i spoke with madrid sporting director pedja mijatovic and with madrid president ramon calderon and they told me that robinho has to stay that he cannot leave
6385715 so we cannot do anything because he has two years on his contract with real madrid
6385716 robinho never said that he is not happy at madrid but the fact is that he has a more interesting economic offer thats all
6385717 yes i have to say that until august 31 anything is possible until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed
6385718 the governor will discuss the logistic cooperation with the chinese company especially the security side
6385719 it was a special game with a new coach for which it was important to win and to have good feelings its clear that i will never forget these two goals with the national team
6385720 i felt very good and as such things have gone a lot easier i will try to continue working to count on the confidence of the coach
6385721 nothings closed now the league is about to start and we are going to monitor that also the under 21s have beaten russia and obtained a great win
6385722 the base of the squad is that which came to denmark but well see what happens after the first round of league matches
6385723 in wien sind es etwa 300 euro pro familie und jahr in ober sterreich aufgrund des geringeren restm llanteils und der unsicheren datenlage sind es etwa 200 bis 300 euro
6385724 im schnitt sagt uns die statistik braucht ein haushalt in ober sterreich rund 300 euro pro monat f r lebensmittelausgaben wenn wir also die eink ufe eines monats wegwerfen dann ist es zeit nachzudenken
6385725 hoy no jugamos bien especialmente en la recepci n y tuvimos problemas con el saque
6385726 if we allow things to continue unchanged and we dont take action today it would destabilize human society
6385727 developing countries will do what they can but it was clearly understood and laid down in the framework convention on climate change in 1992 that the developed countries will take the first steps frankly theyve done nothing at all and thats really tragic
6385728 we came up with the kyoto protocol in 1997 but it got ratified only in 2005 it took so long to give substance to something which had been agreed on in 1992
6385729 i hope that in the next year and a half and particularly in december 2009 when we hopefully will come up with an agreement on what to do beyond 2012 globally that we show a certain resolve and aspiration to do things that are required for the benefit of the human race
6385730 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event

6385740 we appeal to president medvedev the federation council and state duma of the russian federation to recognise our independence
6385741 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6385742 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6385743 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armoured personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6385744 now the hard work starts evaluating the needs and dealing with protection issues
6385745 they are visiting the main hospital which was damaged and evaluating the state of facilities
6385746 some knew their family had gotten out and reached safe shelter and wanted to re establish contact others were saying they didnt know what happened to their loved ones
6385747 overnight they heard isolated shooting as well as explosions which it seems were part of demining efforts it has got residents on edge
6385748 store shelves appear to be empty but they got the impression that the russian government was very present and providing assistance and meeting basic needs
6385749 det r en fr jd att vara n ra leoparder
6385750 by the end of 22 august all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6385751 norway notes that russia has decided that for now it is freezing all military co operation with nato and allied countries
6385752 we expect that this will not affect planned activities in the areas of coastguard operations search and rescue and resource management because on the russian side these are handled by civilian authorities
6385753 theres no doubt that our relationship to russia has now chilled
6385754 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6385755 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past ten years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability
6385756 the decision to move harry potter and the half blood prince was not taken lightly and was never intended to upset our harry potter fans
6385757 devil may care is a period book which is set in the 1960s and it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been making recently
6385758 were trying every tool i cant tell you how many conversations ive had with diplomats and others i keep stressing to the russians that there are american children who are trapped
6385759 yesterday it was like 20 to 25 miles from us now its 10 miles 10 to 15 miles
6385760 of course we know that the danish military is a lot weaker than the u s so you know who well have to call russia theyre the only military that can stand up to the u s think about it
6385761 we are buying military equipment aircraft ammunition to be ready to liberate our territories our military budget has reached 1 3 billion and will continue to grow force is the decisive factor
6385762 a youth movement that aims to funnel transdniestrias young people into constructive activities such as nato baiting
6385763 moldovas relatively new commitment to a western oriented policy is opportunistic rather than deep rooted
6385764 had a sort of presentiment that the olympiad would match the mediocrity of the town
6385765 it represents an expenditure in the last eleven years of 50 000 000 and 5000 lives and a mortifying humiliating failure without a jot of compensation
6385766 it is something existing in the world to name your enemy as a terrorist as the british colonialists called the somali hero mohammed abdullah hassan
6385767 for instance the apartheid era south africans said that nelson mandela was a terrorist and his people know him as a hero
6385768 he said to me we never committed any crime against americans why are they looking for us
6385769 we said its because you are hiding the people who bombed the u s embassies in nairobi and dar es salaam
6385770 mad mullah kills 800 tribesmen slaughtered towns razed and vast areas laid waste
6385771 it makes no difference what the motivation its a very serious matter
6385772 some songs are bloc party at their most wildly experimental while other tracks are simply classic bloc party fitting in seamlessly amongst fan favourites helicopter banquet and so here we are
6385773 good arrows is set in south wales in the world of professional darts it is a satire on the most vacuous and self defeating foible of our times the cult of minor celebrity we have a tight funny and edgy script and have been fortunate to recruit brilliant performers and a highly talented crew who will execute it with aplomb
6385774 the earth will be destroyed by the greed of the people that already have too much and the stupidity of people that think they need more
6385775 we strive to maintain the compatibility of lightzone with the latest and most popular cameras
6385776 our goal is to keep ahead of the trends in digital photography and offer the best tools for digital photo editing bar none
6385777 theres as much likelihood of that happening as there being commercial space flights
6385778 it was both fun and horrible its like having a girlfriend that you have always been in love with and youll always be in love with but you dont quite get along with
6385779 youre still in love with her and every time you get together you end up throwing food at each other
6385780 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie

6385785 this problem occurs approximately one time in every 500 restarts therefore you usually experience this issue only when you are running restart tests however the risk of this problem occurring increases significantly if the following conditions are true you apply hotfix 952681 on the computer you insert pci express cards that do not fully support aspm into all available pci express slots

6385804 hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty
6385805 he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
6385806 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway

6385959 orwell expounded on the importance of honest and clear language and conversely on how misleading and vague language can be a tool of political manipulation in his 1946 essay politics and the english language the language of orwells nineteen eighty four is newspeak a thoroughly politicised and obfuscatory language designed to make coherent thought impossible by limiting acceptable word choices another phrase is big brother or big brother is watching you today security cameras are often thought to be modern societys big brother the current television reality show big brother carries that title because of nineteen eighty four the same novel spawned the title of another television series room 101 the phrase thought police is also derived from nineteen eighty four and might be used to refer to any alleged violation of the right to the free expression of opinion it is particularly used in contexts where free expression is proclaimed and expected to exist doublethink is a newspeak term from nineteen eighty four and is the act of holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously fervently believing both

6385964 when i thought of poverty i thought of it in terms of brute starvation therefore my mind turned immediately towards the extreme cases the social outcasts tramps beggars criminals prostitutes these were the lowest of the low and these were the people with whom i wanted to get into contact what i profoundly wanted at that time was to find some way of getting out of the respectable world altogether
6385965 he had a phobia against rats we got used to them they used to gnaw at our boots during the night but george just couldnt get used to the presence of rats and one day late in the evening he caused us great embarrassment he got out his gun and shot it the whole front and both sides went into action

6385982 comenzamos mal el encuentro y pudimos ir al descanso por debajo en el marcador dinamarca fue mejor que nosotros en el primer tiempo pero supimos reaccionar bien e hicimos un gran encuentro ante un gran rival
6385983 tenemos que reconocer que si no hubiera sido por carles puyol e iker casillas nos habr an hecho alg n gol pero la confianza de los jugadores y su habilidad nos permiti superar el pobre comienzo de partido y llevarnos la victoria tenemos dos partidos de la fase de clasificaci n para la copa mundial de la fifa a la vuelta de la esquina y no nos podemos permitir lujos somos los favoritos para ganar pero no podemos cometer errores sobre todo en los partidos de casa
6385984 con los jugadores que tenemos en el equipo tenemos que seguir jugando de la misma manera que es la que mostramos en el segundo periodo ante dinamarca hay un mont n de j venes jugadores en este equipo y no hemos llegado a nuestro tope queremos que siga el mismo progreso que comenzamos en la uefa euro 2008 y con del bosque parece que va a ser f cil poder mantenerlo

6385988 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6385989 wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6385990 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice
6385991 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6385992 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6385993 it has very little to do with logic and certainly nothing to do with compassion
6385994 the 15 year programme will ensure that the united kingdom has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6385995 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6385996 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6385997 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6385998 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6385999 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6386000 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6386001 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6386002 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6386003 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6386004 we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6386005 im so proud with the way i saved those match points
6386006 i need those kind of matches under my belt its good for my confidence
6386007 i had to dig deep if i can get through those kind of matches i can get through anything
6386008 the thing im most proud of this year is that ive remained consistent throughout
6386009 my goal was to break the top 50 ive done that the rest of the year is bonus for me
6386010 joy satisfaction its been a busy summer we worked so hard its nice to see its paying off
6386011 if it was not clear last night whether the latest algerian attack was a suicide bomber the slovenly algerian press agency declined to say which probably means it was the target foreigners working on a dam project spoke for itself
6386012 ive just started my a new website and thought you might like to write about it
6386013 im holding a golf outing in rio linda california and wanted you to know about it
6386014 i would like to congratulate all irish competitors and in particular the three boxers who have already secured bronze medals at least
6386015 while the achievements of the irish boxers in particular have created a good feeling around the country it is also appropriate that we take the opportunity to ask whether enough is being done to promote sport particularly among young people
6386016 increased heroin seizures in recent months coincide with news of significantly increased numbers of addicts seeking treatment
6386017 it is imperative to the fight against drugs that adequate funding for addictions services is provided by the government and that these services are not affected by cutbacks as the economy continues to slow down
6386018 i would urge the hse to quickly bring to an end its dispute with drugs taskforce staff in clondalkin so that they can get back to their important work at maximum capacity as soon as possible
6386019 sapevo che prima o poi sarebbe arrivato il rigetto del gossip anche io ho avuto una crisi di rigetto nei confronti del pettegolezzo pur essendo stato insieme a roberto dagostino un antesignano del settore ma allora a met degli anni 80 era molto chic occuparsi del gossip spicciolo

6386021 ventanni fa lapproccio era diverso il gossip per un certo periodo stato un fenomeno di costume capace di interessare persone attive in ben altri settori tra questi ci sono stati grandi registi come sergio corbucci o marco ferreri anche luca di montezemolo gareggiava con noi a chi sapeva pi cose sui personaggi famosi o su chi per esempio era pi aggiornato sulla vita di orietta berti
6386022 s lattuale presidente della fiat era un grande esperto sapeva tutto di amenit varie delle vicende familiari di gino bramieri o delluomo di milva era singolare a quel tempo che gente di questo livello invece di ragionare sui massimi sistemi si dilettasse con le news gossipare ci divertiva sapere prima degli altri le cose scherzavamo sul cattivo gusto di certe persone
6386023 nel nostro libro facevano bella mostra di s tanto per ricordare qualcosa la foto di claudio villa in mutande e quella della villa di mario merola il cui stile finto veneziano era davvero terribile

6386029 its a uniformly standard practice of laboratories doing dna testing
6386030 fewer than 15 known incidents of staff contamination over seven years isnt the kind of thing that holds up lab operations
6386031 there were a lot of people who respected each other on both sides of the issue unfortunately it had a sad ending
6386032 but with a reconstituted board and some new members hopefully we can put the hospital system and the medical school back on track

6386034 the governor has made appointments that he believes will serve the long term interests of the medical system and the doctors researchers students and support staff that have made the university of maryland medical system what it is today
6386035 when you pass that decision to someone in annapolis i dont think thats the best process
6386036 if you look at the history of medical systems across the country a huge number of failures come from a lack of independence on how you allocate capital

6386061 this is the century of women and one of the best things the prime minister has done has been to name so many women
6386062 at downing street upon the stair i met man who wasnt blair he wasnt blair again today oh how i wish hed go away
6386063 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6386064 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6386065 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6386066 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6386067 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6386068 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6386069 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6386070 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6386071 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6386072 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6386073 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6386074 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6386075 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6386076 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6386077 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6386078 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6386079 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6386080 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6386081 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6386082 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6386083 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
6386084 i spoke with madrid sporting director pedja mijatovic and with madrid president ramon calderon and they told me that robinho has to stay that he cannot leave
6386085 so we cannot do anything because he has two years on his contract with real madrid
6386086 robinho never said that he is not happy at madrid but the fact is that he has a more interesting economic offer thats all
6386087 yes i have to say that until august 31 anything is possible until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed
6386088 the decree can be defined as original or creative at best
6386089 even the judge who issued the decree states that no infringing material is hosted on the pirate bay which provides just a tracker search engine
6386090 the judge tries to create a sort of contributory infringement accusation against the pirate bay
6386091 we will bring all our arguments before the tribunal and we are confident of the tribunals decision
6386092 it is clear that this decree has been strongly backed up by fimi the italian ifpi
6386093 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6386094 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6386095 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6386096 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6386097 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6386098 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6386099 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6386100 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6386101 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6386102 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6386103 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6386104 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6386105 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6386106 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6386107 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6386108 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6386109 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6386110 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6386111 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6386112 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6386113 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6386114 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6386115 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6386116 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6386117 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6386118 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6386119 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6386120 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6386121 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6386122 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6386123 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6386124 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6386125 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6386126 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6386127 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6386128 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6386129 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6386130 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities
6386131 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6386132 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6386133 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6386134 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6386135 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6386136 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6386137 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6386138 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6386139 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6386140 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6386141 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6386142 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6386143 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
6386144 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6386145 isto porque eles j tinham conhecimento por informa es dispersas que iria ocorrer um atentado de um lado elas davam conta de que seria pelo mar de outro lado que seria um ataque a reo se houvesse integra o com certeza o ataque teria sido evitado
6386146 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6386147 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6386148 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6386149 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6386150 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6386151 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6386152 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6386153 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6386154 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6386155 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6386156 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6386157 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6386158 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6386159 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6386160 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6386161 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6386162 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6386163 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6386164 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6386165 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6386166 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6386167 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6386168 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6386169 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6386170 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6386171 this is a planning took where all things are going
6386172 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6386173 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6386174 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6386175 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6386176 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6386177 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6386178 thats what it was and it needs to stop the us is going to defend its interests its going to defend its allies
6386179 the single greatest threat to the kind of middle east we all want to see
6386180 it was provocative and that kind of provocation is dangerous
6386181 i would sincerely hope that the iranians would refrain from any such activity
6386182 the united states under this president has sent a very strong signal that america has strong interests in the gulf that the united states will continue to defend its interests in the gulf and this goes back for decades
6386183 the director general elbaradei will visit tehran on january 11 and 12
6386184 during the visit elbaradei will meet with a number of high officials he hopes that the visit will develop ways and means to enhance and accelerate implementation of safeguards in iran with a view of resolving all remaining outstanding issues and enabling the agency to provide assurance about irans past and present nuclear activities
6386185 the minister was on his way to parliament when his white toyota land cruiser vehicle was hit by a claymore his vehicle has been badly damaged
6386186 we havent had anything major accident wise slide ins and minor property damage but no serious injuries or fatalities
6386187 the roads arent quite as ice covered but were still telling people not to drive unless they have to the interstate is still slick and the rural roads are really bad
6386188 i know its the holidays but we hope people use some common sense when traveling
6386189 there are a lot of people saying ill just leave that much earlier but still the roads are not favorable for traveling
6386190 organizing scheming or acting to subvert the political power of the state and overthrow the socialist system
6386191 incitement to subvert the political power of the state and overthrow the socialist system by spreading rumors slander or other means
6386192 the all china federation of trade unions shall be established as the unified national organization
6386193 fabricating or spreading false information regarding emergencies and government efforts to cope with emergencies
6386194 provide coordinated accurate and timely information on the emergency and its development
6386195 we tried to play too much football though and pass pass pass not get in behind which is what they did and we were punished for it
6386196 you have to be defensive sometimes in this league which is something they perhaps dont understand yet ledesmas a young lad and theres already a few ball players like him in the team such as hogan ephraim and lee cook
6386197 you have to earn the right to play its important to have people tracking back which is something the new lads are not used to but they work hard in training and theyll learn
6386198 we had a lot of the ball at united and on it we did well from a neutral point of view it was good but from the managers point of view they didnt work hard enough sheffield united is not an easy place to go and you need to put out a side that can battle and get a result
6386199 mikele leigertwood tracked all the time and once they do that sort of thing itll be better
6386200 itll be a shock going to places like blackpool on a tuesday night you get games like those but as long as they learn from them thats all that matters
6386201 the gaffer pulled me to one side and told me i was the best player against barnsley but that he was going to keep the same midfield that ended the first league match
6386202 he wanted to keep the same system and pass united off the park i wasnt happy one minute im captain on the opening day and then im dropped but thats football
6386203 hes a top top coach as a bloke and as a coach he is great for this football club and will prove that given time
6386204 the people ive spoken to tell me they like to get the ball down and pass it
6386205 they play attacking football and the momentum from last season has carried into this one as often happens
6386206 you hear about other clubs expectations like birmingham but we dont think about it weve a new squad with a new manager and new ideas
6386207 we just need to work hard to get results and gel the new lads in
6386208 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against he can talk all he wants about britney and paris but i dont have time for that mess
6386209 weve played the same team and done well so far but i dont have a problem in changing things if the occasion warrants it
6386210 theyve added some italians and spanish players but they are also very strong in certain areas and we have to be aware of that
6386211 i have never thought that you should be too fixated on your opponents because for me it is always how we perform that matters most
6386212 but at the same time you have to take everything into account when you prepare for games
6386213 they were both trying to take responsibility and these things happen thats football
6386214 we are still on a learning curve and finding our feet in this division and we will have more than a few setbacks on the way
6386215 weve coped quite well so far and we can be proud of that but
6386216 it will be interesting to see if brazil lets lucas travel back to england or if he will be forced to sit and watch the bronze medal game on friday
6386217 its absolutely disgusting and wildly inappropriate it wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so big but you just cant avoid it when you drive or walk past its one of the most sexually explicit images they could have possibly chosen without it actually being pornographic
6386218 my goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces
6386219 the weak are not loved and not heard they are insulted and when we have nuclear parity they will talk to us in a different way
6386220 when we build they build when we cut they build
6386221 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6386222 the withdrawal has started at a pace that will have all the russian federations forces behind the line of our zone of responsibility by the end of august 22
6386223 hell on there tomorrow and before the game saturday if everyone hasnt been sorted
6386224 if there are no stupid questions then what kind of questions do stupid people ask do they get smart just in time to ask questions
6386225 then after i order you and all troops that are along with you to be obedient to allah
6386226 i believe that what we called in the past left and right is something that belongs to the past
6386227 we decided that time is against us that time is against the moderates and that stagnation is not an option for the israeli government
6386228 nobody nobody can afford in the region a terror state a failed state or an extreme islamic state between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea
6386229 this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
6386230 it is of mutual interest of israel of russia of the pragmatic leaders in the region not to send these kinds of long range missiles to syria
6386231 esto era lo que yo so aba de peque a ser una aut ntica princesa y estoy muy agradecida de todo lo que me est pasando ahora mismo
6386232 todos los personajes que he interpretado han sido distintos a bella todos han sido muy rockeros y de repente tengo que ser una princesa de disney
6386233 giving popular schools the freedom to expand does not mean they will do so to the extent that a schools position in the league tables depends on the attainment of its intake schools may be unwilling to increase and potentially to dilute the quality of their student body
6386234 everyone knows that there is a strong association between social class and achievement and that this association works very much to the disadvantage of economically disadvantaged students
6386235 the california research however had the virtue of demonstrating that this disadvantage was exaggerated as school size increased
6386236 a fost gasit ciobanu daca la prima intrebare nu va pot oferi un rapsuns la a doua va pot spune un da categoric
6386237 there are doubts over the osces role during the initial stage of the conflict they were notified by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but did not warn russian peacekeepers
6386238 this fact makes us reconsider our relations it is an obligation of the osce to report on troop movements and they must answer for it
6386239 dont be angry with me please all that you say is true how well i know look at my wise penelope she falls far short of you your beauty stature she is mortal after all and you you never age or die nevertheless i long i pine all my days to travel home and see the dawn of my return and if a god wreck me yet again on the wine dark sea i can bear that too with a spirit to endure much have i suffered labored long and hard by now in the waves and wars add this to the total bring the trial on
6386240 esteban is a good sized hard throwing right handed pitcher who is someone weve projected to have a very bright future at the division i level
6386241 esteban is a very intelligent young man he has very good arm action its just a matter of how quickly hes going to mature and adapt to division i were very pleased that he has joined our program as a freshman
6386242 were excited about esteban coming in joining our squad and being a spartan
6386243 we expect that esteban will continue along the same lines as some of our other young guys from last year he should have a good role and be a solid addition for us hopefully he will be a contributor right away
6386244 we are very happy with the guys we have coming in this fall
6386245 we have worked hard to again find not only quality players but just as importantly excellent students and excellent people we have a good mix of guys joining us with pitching and fielders and i think that they will definitely be in a good position to contribute quickly and continue with the success from the guys last year

6386247 no facts regarding the obstacles put toward contenders have been delivered to cec some contenders evaluate a common obstacle as forejudged attitude towards them
6386248 i asked him to show me facts however i have not received anything so far

6386251 daniel how is it that we always show up during some sort of
6386252 we dont i usually just ask if theyd mind doing something special to entertain you
6386253 i suppose so jack its a big universe most ancient earth cultures based their festivals around a celestial or lunar calendar we tend to avoid planets during harsh seasons for safety reasons that probably increases our chances of arriving during some ceremony or celebration longest day of the year harvest planting first day of spring fertility rituals
6386254 hold on there professor back that up this isnt a fertility ritual is it cause i dont really want to explain to hammond how you knocked up carter or tealc
6386255 thats what it is more or less its a month long gathering of all the local villages both to exchange news and to sell wares there are also contests games and other entertainment
6386256 maybe well just forgo the hands on approach this time around
6386257 building a better mousetrap or more accurately an epihad trap
6386258 its a large rodent native to the plains apparently they chew through the food storage huts during the winter and can easily consume the rations of an entire village if left unchecked
6386259 so these epihads theyre only a problem in the winter
6386260 the warm weather sends them back to their mating grounds on the plains youre perfectly safe no need to arm yourself
6386261 i wasnt worried daniel i was considering the value of hunting one down for some of your flora and fauna people to study
6386262 i have been asked to participate in some sort of contest i believe it is a test of strength
6386263 according to nemung its a test of endurance i dont quite understand the details there are some words that dont seem to translate
6386264 come on daniel lets show the locals what the sg 1 boys are made of
6386265 without your pants what kind of contest requires no pants
6386266 it appears that this endurance contest is one of a sexual nature
6386267 the drink was something called erweckev its meant to prepare us for the contest the object is to see who can umm
6386268 the women are here to try to speed things up no touching is allowed but the contestants can use any other method to try to win
6386269 come on jack weve already agreed to this by accepting the erweckev besides i thought you wanted to show the locals what the sg 1 boys are made of
6386270 sure listen to me now this isnt exactly what i had in mind you know
6386271 it is unfortunate that i had to win in such a manner daniel jackson
6386272 i think daniel and the colonel are going to be just fine just remember to leave out the nature of their disqualification in you report
6386273 the fall in the number of children taking foreign languages is of concern particularly as we know from last years results that there is wide regional gap in those taking these exams
6386274 there are areas where fewer than one in four children are entered for a modern foreign language and it is the most disadvantaged families that are worst affected
6386275 our message to young people is to stay on in education or training whatever your results and go on to fulfil your full potential
6386276 once again we have seen a welcome increase in results at gcse despite the lowest entry for five years this is evidence of the hard work of the students and the continued dedication of their teachers
6386277 the core subjects at gcse continue to dominate and still account for almost half of the full course entry
6386278 those schools in very challenging circumstances who continue to achieve remarkable results for their students should be singled out for praise even if they dont meet arbitrary national targets for achievement at a c
6386279 the drop in the total number of entries would suggest that many schools are now turning their backs on gcses particularly in maths

6386283 es un tema complejo en su definici n desde el punto de vista pol tico porque si bien no hay ning n tipo de roce ni nada que se parezca con mis compa eros s hay cuestiones de fondo
6386284 algunos han tomado la decisi n pol tica teniendo congresales que responden a ellos de no apoyar la amnist a de aquellos que tomamos la decisi n de participar electoralmente con otro partido pol tico
6386285 estamos dentro de un frente electoral y nos vamos a tomar el tiempo necesario para tomar una decisi n
6386286 estamos evaluando otras alternativas que tiene que ver con el propio partido uni n y libertad o sino otros partidos pol ticos con los que tenemos gran afinidad a nivel nacional como la uni n popular que responde a eduardo duhalde
6386287 cuando estuve en la c mara de diputados m s all de haber entrado por el frente de unidad provincial trabaj muy ligado a sectores del duhaldismo y mantuvimos contacto en todo este tiempo

6386289 uno no sabe si duhalde va a ser candidato o no a presidente
6386290 es una alternativa que se est dando dentro del peronismo con la que algunos est n m s o menos identificados yo tuve la posibilidad de trabajar con ellos y estamos evaluando eso
6386291 despu s del congreso de lan s hubo un quiebre en el justicialismo en todo el pa s porque en aqu l momento los candidatos a presidente eran todos de ra z justicialista y esto llev a que se rearmen estructuras partidarias pero con ra ces peronistas y el partido uni n y libertad viene de una ra z peronista
6386292 we knew the specialist had done a lot but when they said i was the 1 000th person to have this operation i was surprised

6386296 deocamdata am digitalizat intreaga diagnosticare in imagini de la radiografii la tac investind suma de 120 000 de euro dar economisind 60 000 de euro fiindca nu mai sunt cumparate lichidele pentru developarea filmelor din nefericire realitatea sanitara in italia este foarte complexa unele regiuni nu reusesc sa faca fata din cauza deficitului si nu reusesc sa acceada la proiecte cum sunt cel european privind banca sanitara digitala
6386297 we shall undertake a restructuring exercise to improve efficiency and productivity when this is done many things happen staff get promoted and new jobs are created that bring in new staff
6386298 to remove redundancies and avoid duplication some who cannot get absorbed elsewhere are laid off
6386299 the fuel arrived in july and the marketers got it this month which means that what we buy this month will be used later this year
6386300 whether it goes down drastically or not we can only cut prices after some analysis and consideration of the other controlling factors
6386301 we cannot react on a daily basis since it takes time for us to feel the changes
6386302 we are very happy that the government has come out to be part of the initiative every person is a road user whether you have a car or not we want to get professional and disciplined drivers through this initiative
6386303 our main aim is to educate enforce and create awareness in the public about road safety with the support from various partners the rampant road carnage will hopefully reduce

6386310 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6386311 nos encontramos con el mismo planteo que se nos hiciera a principios de a o cuando en realidad nuestra intenci n era poder tomar conocimiento formal sobre una serie de importantes temas que trascendieron por los medios es m s la reuni n se diluy cuando la gobernadora se retir porque ten a una reuni n con alan clutterbuck de la empresa alpargatas
6386312 tarifaria corta se est n recaudando 17 millones por mes ese incremento no se ve reflejado en el ingreso mensual por rentas
6386313 plante el tema de aerol neas para conocer cu l era la estrategia pol tica del gobierno a trav s de los diputados y senadores oficialistas ante el tratamiento del proyecto de reestatizaci n en el congreso pero no hubo ninguna definici n concreta sobre el particular
6386314 sobre la preocupante situaci n que ya se vislumbra en el sector industrial con despidos en f bricas textiles o del pl stico o con el enfriamiento de la econom a provincial
6386315 creci en un 40 pero argumentaron que ello era responsabilidad de los compromisos asumidos por la anterior gesti n y que ellos tuvieron que cumplir
6386316 como conclusi n podr a decirle que a nuestro bloque esta reuni n no le dej nada ya que no se habl de aquellos temas que consider bamos importantes y ni siquiera se nos plante cu ndo nos van a remitir formalmente las cartas de intenci n que ya firmaron
6386317 ya que por un lado nos hablan de la necesidad de mejorar los ingresos por la v a de la recaudaci n tributaria pero por el otro no quieren hablar de temas que involucran potenciales y muy importantes nuevos recursos econ micos para la provincia
6386318 it is the owners responsibility to ensure that their property is secure
6386319 allerdale council has asked the owner to secure the property on several occasions in 1999 2000 august 2005 and november 2005 all of these requests were complied with
6386320 this is a long term dilapidated property which was put onto the councils hit list of 20 such sites in 2007
6386321 further to this in february this year it was selected one of four properties from the list to be specifically targeted for action by the council we wrote to the owner to inform him of this
6386322 i was reading something from alan hansen during the summer and it really brought it home to me
6386323 you cant criticise much of what liverpool teams of the past did when hansen was playing obviously they were the best team around but it was interesting to read him say that sometimes liverpool won the league even though they didnt have a particularly great side
6386324 he went on to say that there is no possible way you could do that today it struck a chord with me and i thought it was a fair point
6386325 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6386326 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6386327 look at the other top sides in the premier league even the full back positions are filled with the best full backs in the world now
6386328 years ago you could probably get away with carrying the odd player here or there
6386329 it was good for me to hear that from someone who actually played back then rather than it coming from current players where itd probably just sound like an excuse
6386330 basically what hansen was saying was that its more difficult to win the league now than in his day the standards have been raised much higher over the past five to 10 years especially with the chelsea situation and whats happening there
6386331 some people got loans to develop the plots and the banks are on our necks
6386332 it has become a custom to resist development in kampala especially by sitting tenants and some politicians but development is irreversible whoever stands in the way will be defeated
6386333 the land act stipulates that if a land owner kcc is going to sell land the sitting tenant has to be given first priority in this case we the traders are the sitting tenants
6386334 while credit is possible the process of accessing it is more difficult
6386335 garbage is a problem in the municipality we shall clean up the town for healthy and economic development
6386336 the records of the former fighting forces and armies are being verified so that payments are made to the right people
6386337 hell have further assessment in melbourne but it doesnt look as bad as initially feared
6386338 no we dont need one i dont want one where would i even put one no no no please no
6386339 the problem was getting out of hand we used to receive about 10 people with major injuries due to accidents daily
6386340 accidents are not only hurting our bodies but also the economy something has to be done and now
6386341 between january and may about 65 people were seriously injured each month either their legs or spinal cords were cut or broken
6386342 we have started examining details of the northern bypass and will probably produce a report in two weeks the details are so complex that even some insiders find it difficult to explain them
6386343 it has been unfinished for too long and needs to be settled
6386344 ik ben heel erg verrast dat er al een naam circuleert ik heb niet eens de offici le voordracht ontvangen die zou ik volgende week krijgen rond 1 september zou ik dan een besluit nemen
6386345 im a million different people from one day to the next
6386346 eu n o sou o nico nem o mais importante e reconhe o meus limites
6386347 i was probably a little too relaxed i didnt have that real race head on me
6386348 i probably shouldnt say this but even though we had all day i ended up having to get out of the boat half way up the warm up lake and walked over the middle section carrying his kayak just to get to start line on time maybe that was a like too laid back
6386349 if you have a set goal the goal is olympic medal type thing
6386350 in a way it does take the pressure off a little but it doesnt take the pressure of trying to grab one of those medals
6386351 you think have a crack at it while i am here i am not here to bake cookies

6386414 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6386415 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution

6386440 one possibility is that a suboptimal immune system may predate the onset of both respiratory disease and mental disorders

6386448 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6386449 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6386450 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6386451 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6386452 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem mr harrison said

6386591 so if you believe that the media covered up for john edwards then you also believe that major american news organizations should take reporters away from the campaign trail or pull them off stories about where the candidates stand on the gasoline crisis or afghanistan so they can spend months and thats how long it takes to definitively prove whether mccain was having sex with vicki iseman or to look again into the discredited charges made against obama or even though hillary clinton has dropped out of the race i think prove that bill is still having sexual relations with those women
6386592 if you think the media is covering up for edwards but should not aggressively be probing these stories including the sex life of john mccain then you are being a hypocrite
6386593 proof of what the press corps suspected all along that edwards politics were not genuine that he is a self aggrandizing phony it is apparently of a piece with his expensive haircut and garishly sprawling mansion his phoniness and his love of money how infidelity fits into the confusing claim that theres something hypocritical rather than admirable about a rich politician attempting to raise taxes on himself and his class in order to better fund social services for the poor isnt quite clear but never mind that theres another truth on display here one that has little to do with rielle hunter the political establishment really really hates john edwards
6386594 that is because theres no ache to tarnish mccains sainthood no desire to construct a narrative incorporating the keating five and personal infidelity and dizzying ideological shifts keyed to political ambitions into some sort of incoherent whole that wrecks mccains reputation with edwards by contrast there is in 2004 running as a cautious and quiet centrist he was a darling of the establishment but his populist reinvention enraged them unlike mccains transformation from an unpredictable renegade who almost joined the democrats in 2002 to a doctrinaire conservative who out reaganed the competition in 2008 edwards drift to the left cast immediate doubt on his basic integrity from there it was almost a competition to decisively prove his essential phoniness his 400 haircut was somehow far more damning than mccains 500 loafers
6386595 astounded to see that the measure could predict aggressive behaviour in a real world setting
6386596 if someone was given the choice of one of two opponents to compete against who differed on the basis of the facial metric would the facial metric predict the less aggressive opponent

6386717 its hard to pick but i know that my place is probably in the goal but its nice to get a chance every now and then
6386718 we know the level of plays going to stay the same whoever is in there

6386726 you just go to the state fair as if its the grand prize because you dont just compete with the people in your county youre competing against the whole state of maryland its really enjoyable
6386727 i think the fair now teaches kids about agriculture because they dont know as much about farming as they did when i was growing up
6386728 its local producers involved with maryland food and its pretty neat kind of a unique place
6386729 the university of maryland is bringing cattle in which is something they havent done in many years theyre doing a promotion for their dairy and other things that they have going on
6386730 theres the birthing center and the petting zoo so kids can see these animals and its just a learning experience for them
6386731 ive been coming to the fair since i was born
6386732 its kind of the end of the summer to me i enjoy seeing the people and what theyve done throughout the year
6386733 its like the sound of the sirens leading odysseus to his death

6386735 i was working with a native american undertone with this project
6386736 and i wanted to capture a natural light from the sun and shadow i wanted to achieve that sonically i wanted to go after what comes from the organic natural world once i knew the elements this woman getting to know the soul of america i had a research team to pull everything together to make it air tight its probably the most time ive spent writing and researching a record
6386737 what i needed to achieve was to get people to develop a relationship with the land separate from those who were using the land its what i saw in peoples eyes on sept 11 scarlet went on this search to discover who this creature america is
6386738 but i was more interested in what stevie wonder was doing

6386752 financial markets are frazzled and the jobs situation is getting worse but there is a surprising bit of good news for the economy in the months ahead
6386753 prices for global commodities oil of course but also a variety of metals agricultural products and other raw materials have been falling steadily since mid july after reaching record highs prices are still elevated pinching consumers and businesses alike but these modest declines should offer some relief to stretched american pocketbooks in the months ahead and help reverse some of the steep rise in inflation that occurred in the spring and early summer
6386754 the price of oil closed at 114 98 a barrel yesterday down from 145 18 on july 14 that drop is starting to trickle down to the price americans pay for gasoline according to aaa the average nationwide price was 3 99 a gallon yesterday down from 4 34 a month ago there have been similar declines in natural gas gold corn and many other commodities
6386755 as prices for crude oil and other commodities ease consumers have gotten a small dose of relief at the gas pump but dont expect less pain at the grocery counter
6386756 food inflation is here to stay and will probably get worse for some things
6386757 thats because retail prices for cereal eggs cheese and meat generally lag by several months or longer world prices for wheat corn and soybeans the raw ingredients of so much of our food some food items may come down modestly as commodities prices cool off others might not budge a cent and some may actually increase
6386758 another factor keeping food prices high though commodities prices have fallen from record levels theyre still well above historical levels
6386759 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away said ephraim leibtag an economist with the u s department of agriculture who tracks retail food prices
6386760 we cant even buy there said barton who added that rising food and energy costs have almost doubled rome based wfps annual budget to feed hungry people from 3 1 billion to 6 billion
6386761 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away barton said
6386762 looking ahead to next year economists see a mixed bag for american consumers while falling grain prices should slow the rate of increases for baked goods the usdas leibtag says people can expect to pay more for other items like
6386763 thats because as grain markets took off the cost of corn and soybean based animal feed skyrocketed now livestock owners who spend half or more of their production costs on feeding their animals have had to thin the size of their herds and flocks to deal with the increases cow slaughter has jumped 22 percent over last year while hog slaughter is up 10 percent
6386764 commercial pork production next year is expected to be about 23 billion pounds 2 3 percent below production this year
6386765 usdas august forecast for the 2008 2009 average farm price of corn is 4 90 5 90 per bushel compared with julys forecast of 5 50 6 50 the lower expectations for corn prices next year reflect more positive supply conditions than were anticipated earlier in this growing season
6386766 at issue is an indicator few people beyond the chicken ranch follow eggs set colloquially called egg sets this measures the quantity of eggs set into incubation one of the earliest steps in chicken production for the week ended aug 16 egg sets declined 4 from a year ago according to the agriculture department the trend is expected to continue when the next batch of numbers is reported next week
6386767 for struggling chicken producers such as tyson foods and pilgrims pride that math equals potentially plumper profits even if the companies cost structures dont change ms jones heather jones at bb amp t capital markets says higher prices should be pure flow through to earnings
6386768 but restaurants could feel plucked chicken is generally one of the three top commodity expenses for eateries and rising costs for a key menu ingredient exacerbate the pain as other commodity costs are rising and restaurant sales are shrinking amid a slack economy
6386769 u s consumers should brace for the biggest increase in food prices in nearly 20 years in 2008 and even more pain next year due to surging meat and produce prices the agriculture department said on wednesday
6386770 food prices are forecast to rise by 5 percent to 6 percent this year making it the largest annual increase since 1990 just last month usda forecast food prices would climb between 4 5 and 5 5 percent in 2008
6386771 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july usda economist ephraim leibtag who prepared the forecast said in an interview
6386772 a broad range of commodities posted record highs this year including corn and soybeans prices have since backed off as concerns over smaller crops due to a wet spring in the u s midwest have largely dissipated
6386773 in its first estimate of the fall harvest usda last week forecast a corn crop of 12 29 billion bushels the second largest on record
6386774 despite the near record crops farm gate prices for this years corn wheat and soybean crops while lower than earlier forecasts will still set records
6386775 wheat prices jumped above 9 a bushel wednesday on expectations that warm dry weather in argentina and australia will hurt crops and tighten world supplies wheat for december delivery surged 29
6386776 wheats rally boosted other agriculture futures december corn added 10 5 cents to settle at 5 95 a bushel while november soybeans rose 24 cents to settle at 13 a bushel
6386777 also boosting prices were concerns about midwest corn and soybean crops which have shown mixed results after a late growing start caused by severe june flooding
6386778 iran this summer resumed buying u s wheat after a 27 year hiatus a sign of the limited options for importers seeking large quantities of high quality grain
6386779 since the 2008 09 marketing year began on june 1 iran has bought more than one million tons of hard red winter wheat directly from the u s which is a very large amount said bill nelson analyst for wachovia securities
6386780 drought is expected to slash irans domestic production by one third this year iran is forecast to produce 10 million tons of wheat this year down from 15 million tons in 2007 08 and to import 4 5 million tons up from 200 000 tons last year according to the u s department of agriculture
6386781 before its recent purchases iran hadnt imported any wheat from the u s since 1981 82
6386782 iran cant look to australia for large amounts of wheat as domestic supplies there have been drained after two years of poor production because of drought
6386783 australias 2008 09 crop looks better but the full scale harvest wont begin until the fall argentinas crop meanwhile is suffering from dryness and wont be cut until later this year canadians and europeans are in the process of harvesting their winter wheat though there are some concerns about quality in parts of the eu
6386784 the united states chief trade envoy on wednesday said washington would support the struggling global trade talks regardless of which party wins the upcoming u s presidential election
6386785 u s trade representative susan schwab said she still hoped to reach a breakthrough in the seven year world trade organization negotiation before leaving her post when u s president george w bushs term ends january 20
6386786 but should a long sought agreement to open up farm and industrial markets around the world remain out of reach she said the next american administration under republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will continue to fight for a deal
6386787 schwab who clashed with top negotiators from china and india over the emergency farm tariffs said any new push would still depend on advanced developing countries making appropriate concessions given their increased importance in the global trading system and the gains they would secure in any trade treaty
6386788 one of those issues was u s subsidies to american cotton farmers which some countries pointed to after the july collapse
6386789 schwab said the u s stands by a commitment it made to cut cotton subsidies as part of a deal deeper and faster than for other agricultural commodities but the 153 nation wto first needs to finalize terms for corn soybean wheat and those other products before the u s can address cotton she said
6386790 watching barges slowly work their way up and down the ohio river is familiar enough for many people in southern indiana but the opposite perspective standing on the barge and watching as the towns and trees go by is something else entirely
6386791 on monday a few hundred local farmers elected officials and other invited guests were given a three hour tour on the river by the indiana corn growers association and the indiana corn marketing council
6386792 the unquestioned highlight of the cruise was the unique perspective of the river it provided however the trip was really intended to encourage support for river transportation a major factor in how much money it takes to grow and transport corn and other crops
6386793 two u s congressmen including indiana 8th district rep brad ellsworth and minnesotas collin peterson spoke on the importance of river transportation
6386794 the newburgh dam was a point of interest for many of the corn growers from illinois who took the tour it is a model of the modern type of locks and dams theyd like to see built on the mississippi where many of the dams are more than 70 years old
6386795 its so much easier to be happy my love its so much easier to choose to love the things that you have and you have so much instead of always yearning for what youre missing or what it is that youre imagining youre missing it is so much more peaceful
6386796 be bold and courageous when you look back on your life youll regret the things you didnt do more than the things you did
6386797 theres something seriously wrong with these people who worship wave hankies get teary eyed and curtsy in the face of royalty i would recommend psychiatric therapy to these people while taking away their right to vote till theyve passed a constitutional test and proven their adulthood in ways other than arriving at a particular numerical age being able to hold down a job or be legally eligible to bear children
6386798 i dont like those formulae that tell you there have to be eight offensive linemen and five wide receivers and so forth
6386799 i have always felt you have to keep the 53 best players you have and the rest will sort of take care of itself
6386800 there is still a way to go in the preseason and anything such as injuries can happen i am convinced that we will keep the best players
6386801 all these players have played in the super 14 and are a mix of youth and experience

6386840 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

6386882 sterreichweit ist dieses modell einzigartig und wird nun auch von den anderen bundesl ndern bernommen
6386883 die vielen lehrlingsma nahmen die in k rnten gesetzt werden fruchten sehr die derzeitigen schlechten zahlen resultieren einfach daraus dass sich viele jugendliche nach dem abschluss des 9 schuljahres noch nicht entschlossen haben welchen weiteren bildungsweg sie einschlagen m chten erfahrungsgem melden sich viele jugendliche zum schulschluss sowohl in schulen als auch als lehrstellensuchende an das hat zur folge dass derzeit sehr viele lehrstellensuchende gemeldet sind welche im herbst wahrscheinlich wieder die schule besuchen

6386900 wir m ssen das projekt europa allen b rgerinnen n her bringen hier haben die regierungen der letzten jahre kl glich versagt statt zu informieren einblicke zu gew hren und ehrliche ffentliche diskussionen zu f rdern hat rot schwarz die eu leichtfertig als spielball f r die eigenen interessen missbraucht wie zuletzt die sp mit ihrer inszenierten kehrtwende in der eu politik solche darbietungen halte ich f r bedenklich das zukunftsprojekt europa verdient eine faire politik

6386903 als folge der unrechtm igen spekulationsgesch fte beim personal einzusparen ist der falsche weg
6386904 die einzelnen gesellschaften die in diese spekulationen involviert waren beginnen ein gigantisches sparprogramm zu fahren wie immer in erster linie auf kosten der besch ftigten
6386905 wenn vorstandssprecher klugar glaubt die verfehlungen des managements auf dem r cken der besch ftigten austragen zu k nnen so fassen wir betriebsr te das als kriegserkl rung auf mit der wir gut umgehen k nnen
6386906 klar ist dass sich hier die ausgaben in eine unverantwortliche art und weise entwickeln der vorstandsvorsitzender sollte hier einmal f r einen vern nftigen umgang mit den ressourcen sorgen und kr ftig einsparen
6386907 i suppose they thought they were an easier touch but it was such a crass attempt at fraud anyone could see there was something a bit odd as far as we know no one fell for it

6386909 es besteht eine prinzipielle bereinkunft der oppositionsparteien die sondersitzung wird demn chst beantragt es ist bezeichnend dass die sp wieder einmal njet gesagt hat
6386910 danke herr h upl die sp ist in sachen sozialpolitik und inflationsbek mpfung nicht mehr ernst zu nehmen ich fordere die wiener sp ein letztes mal dazu auf den antrag auf abhaltung einer sondersitzung zu unterst tzen und das valorisierungsgesetz abzuschaffen dilettieren sie nicht sondern handeln sie einmal

6386928 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6386929 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6386930 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend

6386945 working with her was definitely a dream of mine and when it came to actually doing it it was everything youd think it would be
6386946 it was great and it was bad and it was cool and it was tedious sometimes and it was fun and we went down into the valleys together and we came out on top of mountains

6386966 there is still work to do but were making progress
6386967 we are operating as if this sort of environment will be around for another year or so
6386968 if you are complacent you are going to get hurt in this economy
6386969 today were living with the financial crisis aftermath and tightness of credit
6386970 that means a lot of retail real estate deals are not going to happen
6386971 in many prime retail areas like rancho cucamonga you have seen a fairly dramatic increase in rental rates in the past five or six years
6386972 were now seeing a point where retail sales cant sustain these rents
6386973 we look at our new store openings as a long term commitment and long term opportunity
6386974 retailers are looking to clean out marginal stores but will invest in the best locations
6386975 ive heard a rumor that youre going to pick a pro life vp is that true
6386976 life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6386977 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6386978 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6386979 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6386980 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you therell be another one of these firestorms
6386981 any choice he makes for vice president will have pros and cons

6386983 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6386984 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6386985 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6386986 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6386987 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6386988 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6386989 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6386990 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6386991 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6386992 california led the way into our culture of car dependence so it is only appropriate that the state lead the way out
6386993 es ist die zeit gekommen unser system der rechts und amtshilfe im bereich der steuern auf eine neue grundlage zu stellen
6386994 the devil finds work for idle hands and that is why this government is committed to giving our young people positive things to do with their lives we want to show them that there is more to life than drink drugs and offending
6386995 basketball as a street game can help stop kids from getting into trouble or up to mischief its a game they watch on tv and see in other media outlets now they are getting a chance to play it
6386996 in my early years i made some bad decisions which almost cost me my life
6386997 i worked my way through some difficult times because of this i have a good understanding of the challenges which face young people on the streets in scotland
6386998 all of us at the rocks are looking forward to being involved in this expansion programme
6386999 sport has the ability to dismantle cultural and territorial barriers to change attitudes and to inspire our young people
6387000 i suppose they thought they were an easier touch but it was such a crass attempt at fraud anyone could see there was something a bit odd as far as we know no one fell for it
6387001 we understand how frustrating it can be for our passengers for their journeys to take longer than usual and we want them to know that we are deploying staff to monitor the situation
6387002 unfortunately in these circumstances there is very little that anyone can do and everyone travelling on these routes will be affected by these works car drivers other bus operators delivery drivers and other road users
6387003 happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony
6387004 a slip of the foot you may soon recover but a slip of the tongue you may never get over

6387006 its not work its a burning passion thats never dissipated in me
6387007 se introduciamo la politica nel csm e mi pare evidente che si miri a questo rischiamo di richiamarci ad un modello autoritario ovverosia quello fascista dove la magistratura non indipendente dal potere politico e quindi non tutti i cittadini sono garantiti allo stesso modo
6387008 per ora parlare di un viaggio del papa in cina del tutto prematuro tuttavia le parole del vescovo li shan manifestano che tutti i cattolici cinesi amano e rispettano il papa ne riconoscono lautorit e sarebbero lieti di incontrarlo e questo certo un aspetto molto positivo ed incoraggiante
6387009 lintervista del vescovo li shan pu essere considerata ha commentato lombardi ai microfoni di radio vaticana uno dei segnali con cui da parte cinese si risponde alla disponibilit e allauspicio manifestato dal papa nella sua lettera di un anno fa per cercare una normalizzazione dei rapporti tra cina e santa sede
6387010 he is universally well regarded and is a wonderful wonderful man
6387011 its an unprecedented opportunity to be so close to the law that governs the united states and in many ways influences the world
6387012 it was professor david obriens constitutional law seminar that first got me interested
6387013 its hard to imagine something that holds a candle to this
6387014 if there is an opportunity to invest we will look at it
6387015 growing with our blue chip companies and our direct investment activities temasek now owns a net portfolio of about 185 billion singapore at market value as at end march
6387016 it was a pretty difficult period in global equity markets for sure i suppose they were pretty clever
6387017 even the singapore dollar was strong during the period so it wasnt as if they got a big boost from the currency
6387018 our total shareholder return measuring changes in shareholder funds including dividends paid and excluding new capital is a healthy 17 per cent compounded annually since inception

6387020 weve never see that before anywhere else weve looked in the ocean
6387021 maybe the viruses that these bacteria are harbouring have genes that are aiding the bacteria in surviving in this harsh environment
6387022 when you network you are trying to create a positive reputation business contacts and business referrals
6387023 affiliate marketing what is affiliate marketing it is simply a form of internet marketing that rewards the affiliates for driving traffic to the advertiser or for other transactions
6387024 we think newspaper stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry
6387025 we expect mcclatchy to see 4 7 annual revenue declines over the next five years and only irregular profitability
6387026 this administration has used all these tools to stop new attacks
6387027 and these tools will be available for future administrations to protect the american people for years to come
6387028 its a great sport this theres carnage all all the track
6387029 held separately under the control of the malta lotteries and gaming authority and cannot be seized by any court
6387030 will in effect bring down boss medias operation in their licensed jurisdiction of malta
6387031 in the extremely unlikely event that any malta operations would be affected boss media have high performance back up systems in place to ensure continued service to all our customers and their players
6387032 poker trillions recent comments are a reckless attempt to support a legal action that is without merit and initiated as retribution for their dismissal from the boss media network they have since then repeatedly tried to disrupt the boss media business through the dissemination of groundless rumors
6387033 the allegations were false but typical of the type of tactics employed by poker trillion
6387034 it should also be noted that despite appeals from boss media weve been successful in every one of our applications that weve filed with the courts in malta and this includes having our initial garnishee order increased from 5million to 20million earlier this month
6387035 it doesnt matter whether youre dealing with sound recordings pictures software or written text the courts have consistently ruled that p2p peer to peer and other unauthorized uploading and downloading inherently amount to copyright infringement and therefore constitute a crime
6387036 there is no solid line between fair use and illegal use
6387037 to paraphrase an old clich one mans fair use is another mans infringement
6387038 on a lot of these social networking sites adolescents put up much of the content and they often do not understand the implications of their actions
6387039 historically if you take a small bit say a few lines in a song that was generally not considered significant enough to warrant any action
6387040 the new media outlets are threatening to put traditional television and newspapers out of business
6387041 if there are a lot of mishaps and the mission is not going as planned then unfortunately we are really busy
6387042 when the mission is going well then we tend to not be working so much which is good
6387043 its something that has to be done as it gives closure and the proper respects that they deserve for paying the ultimate sacrifice out here
6387044 its so emotional out there and nobody else in the band gets to experience this but us we take a lot of pride in what we do and every time we go out there it needs to be perfect
6387045 some of them are young 19 year old trumpet players who have to grab their gear meet some folks that they probably dont know down at the helipad jump on a helicopter and just show up and play taps
6387046 i dont know that any of us even understand what goes though their minds
6387047 i feel its an important job but its also something that you dont want to do
6387048 if you have to go on a mission if you have to play taps it means that someone went down
6387049 i could hear him he was saying wheres daddy wheres daddy and it was rough because thats why we were there to play and render honors for him the childs father
6387050 we got shelled during the ceremony right before i was going to play taps
6387051 when you are doing a lot of memorials it can weigh on you and your emotional state is out of sorts you know what you are doing youre going on a mission to render honors to a fellow soldier who has paid the ultimate sacrifice
6387052 its also very humbling and its an honor to be there doing this
6387053 its been just sort of calm like everything is going well from a soldiers perspective
6387054 from our perspective you can definitely correlate how well things are going based on how busy our buglers are
6387055 i really dont think about the big picture too much
6387056 when i get notified that i have a mission i just try to focus on that i dont really try to equate it into the big picture just focus on what i have to do
6387057 i just focus on taking care of my guys making sure everybody has what they need and they take care of me just as much as i take care of them
6387058 he is very motivated i would say that he sets the right example and is the epitome of professionalism he always sets the example tactically and technically on the horn
6387059 as an nco and as a leader hes phenomenal along with sgt rivera its like i said theyre a unique breed and hes the epitome of that
6387060 even within the band he stands out he could be an infantry soldier and he would be just fine hes got that mindset
6387061 even though its hard to deal with as buglers you can never complain about what you do
6387062 even if i had to do one hundred memorials in a month each one would be done to perfection every time it means so much to us that we render the proper military honors for our troops out here we put everything we have into it we put our soul into it
6387063 setanta and his manager met with myself and carlton coach brett ratten this morning to discuss the operations available to assist his treatment and recovery
6387064 we believe this is the best option available to ensure setanta is able to fully recover from this injury
6387065 bobos away with guinea on international duty at the moment so we cant take things any further until he gets back
6387066 but we are hopeful a deal could be done to be honest weve looked at a million centre backs and balde is still the one who stands out
6387067 his physical presence is superb and he also has experience of playing at the top level i dont like to talk too much about transfer deals particularly as its very early days
6387068 all these players have played in the super 14 and are a mix of youth and experience
6387069 with overseas offers an attractive lure for our players we dont underestimate how important it is that the guys have all indicated that they want to continue playing rugby here
6387070 our franchises also deserve credit for creating a supportive environment and pathway which gives the chance for our players to develop
6387071 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6387072 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace

6387076 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6387077 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
6387078 in the next 6 12 months facebook is developing the ability for advertisers to throttle usage and engagement in areas they care about marketers will be able to pay to accelerate usage they find valuabel to dial up and down actions that people take on applications as part of the social ads program for instance news feed uses an algorithm to communicate a users actions to the friends who would find it most interesting marketers will be able to pay for increased or enhanced distribution above and beyond what news feed already provides
6387079 facebook is exploring ways to make it completely transparent which actions are commercially accelerated on the platform essentially in similar way to which google color codes sponsored search links above its organic search results
6387080 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse
6387081 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6387082 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6387083 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6387084 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6387085 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6387086 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6387087 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6387088 its a good time for the team to really jell together because after the third one its two more weeks and youre playing for real

6387106 this is the most depressed housing market since the great depression
6387107 how are they going to sell these houses in a timely fashion and not leave us with a hole in the ground
6387108 i think mcniff is sort of the last man standing
6387109 weve got something the neighbors like and the city likes
6387110 its worth a shot there are many ways to prevent a hole in the ground
6387111 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6387112 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6387113 we realize that codeine is very useful for many women the point here is to be much more sensitive and not assume that it is safe
6387114 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6387115 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6387116 i havent had any money yet i think its something to do with

6387119 its not as glamorous as people think it has its ups and downs
6387120 its not partying all the time sometimes when i get the chance i am too
6387121 the honor didnt hit me until i saw who i would be sharing the stage with

6387126 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6387127 there were the hull sides and bottom and then all the detail work
6387128 now its sound and safe and coast guard approved this is something ive always wanted to do
6387129 once youve done it its relatively easy to stay on top of it
6387130 ive been doing this for 20 years my dad was a lifelong woodworker it was the movie on golden pond that sparked my dads interest he found an old chris craft that had never been finished
6387131 since then weve bought every one we can find at one point we had a lot of boats and none of them worked but now were making momentum i estimate we have 15 total boats
6387132 i love everything about them the sight the smell the sound they have a lot of dimensions that will keep me coming back for more
6387133 i have a long time interest in supporting the heritage show
6387134 you never can tell what will drive through those gates
6387135 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it
6387136 he practiced tuesday and just felt like he couldnt get up and go full speed
6387137 other guys will have to step up for the time that hes out
6387138 a zoologist should not propose a name that when spoken suggests a bizarre comical or otherwise objectionable meaning
6387139 you would be surprised how many people come just to watch the greased pig contest
6387140 weve had several adults say hey we would like to do this
6387141 its kind of like the last thing before the kids go back to school
6387142 you hear a lot of good things back from people
6387143 they approve us doing it its something you can do for family thats not expensive

6387145 antes de salir ha habido un momento en el que me he emocionado mucho porque sab a que iba a nadar para eso para la medalla y que seguramente cuando acabara tendr a la sensaci n esa
6387146 el secreto ha estado en entrenar m s en acertar m s con las coreograf as arriesgar m s buscar cosas nuevas marcarse objetivos y mantener esa ilusi n

6387151 esto es una maniobra de ultim sima hora que antes coloquialmente se llamaba calienta braguetas primero se toma una iniciativa unilateral al margen de la unidad de acci n entre los partidos catalanes que podr a haber complicado la vida al gobierno catal n en su negociaci n y despu s la acaba retirando a cambio absolutamente de nada de humo
6387152 el presidente de icv ha generado unas expectativas y ahora las ha defraudado no entendemos esta nueva actuaci n unilateral a menos de 24 horas de una diputaci n permanente en el congreso donde estaba previsto pedir la comparecencia del presidente espa ol
6387153 una separaci n clara entre el papel del govern de la generalitat y el de los partidos
6387154 en calidad de qu joan saura ha negociado con la vicepresidenta del gobierno mar a teresa fern ndez de vega para que sea el ministro de econom a pedro solbes quien comparezca en el congreso para explicar por qu se ha incumplido el estatut y en qu consiste el anuncio de una nueva propuesta de financiaci n para el mes de noviembre
6387155 the defendant was arrested as he was placing a bomb inside the house that belonged to a displaced family in the neighbourhood
6387156 the warrants accused him of murder and displacing people in al adel neighbourhood
6387157 we strongly denounce this heinous act we are shocked by this barbaric action that was carried out by executive bodies against national figures
6387158 it is an attempt to target me as i am always demanding the release of prisoners and talking against sectarianism
6387159 no doubt that mendis performance in the on going india sri lanka series is very good but media has highlighted him a bit too prominently it is too early to say if he will continue to perform like this for long
6387160 so far mendis has done extraordinary well and launched his cricket carrier in a marvellous way but indian batsmen are capable enough to tackle his bowling
6387161 government should concentrate to all sports if india likes to improve its tally in the medal list of olympic
6387162 hal dll is missing or corrupt i also used to get a invaild boot ini but i have fixed that now
6387163 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free
6387164 both of these expansions are rich in content and adventure and will provide our players with hours of excitement as they explore the online world of norrath
6387165 happy purple day to you happy purple day to you happy purple day dear super stars
6387166 what counts is to show the world that the ctbts verification system really works
6387167 the integrated field exercise is a major priority for us in 2008 its important for preparing for the entry into force of the ctbt
6387168 the former soviet nuclear testing site of semipalatinsk where 456 nuclear explosions were carried out between 1949 and 1989 is an ideal site for conducting the exercise
6387169 its features such as radioactivity or boreholes make it an ideal location for our experts as foreseen by the treaty the area to be searched for signs of a recent nuclear explosion will be limited to 1 000 square kilometres
6387170 since our company is undergoing rapid growth we needed a solution that would give us the ability to make real time changes
6387171 incontact created a cost effective means to consolidate three telephony and communications systems that manage the phone long distance calling and outbound dialing into a single application
6387172 a robust range of tracking and reporting has been paramount to how we manage our center
6387173 this is not the first time ucn has successfully replaced an existing hosted solution the breadth of functionality provided by incontact coupled with our depth of experience as a network infrastructure provider puts us in a position our hosted competitors cannot match our enterprise grade acd and redundant server centers in los angeles and dallas offer a best in class platform designed to increase productivity improve performance insights and reduce overall operational costs
6387174 sunderland are a huge club and their fans are amongst the most passionate in the country
6387175 they live for the game in the north east and there is no doubt that sunderland are a club on the up
6387176 it has been flattering being linked with sunderland and while i have not been angling for a move from fulham you never say never in football
6387177 for anyone it would be a big challenge playing for a club like sunderland
6387178 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6387179 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6387180 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6387181 im really excited about the next stage of my career hopefully helping arsenal to glory
6387182 the clear evidence is now that there is in fact a serious dissident threat to the lives of police officers
6387183 it is the federations view that the optimistic view of 2006 when the agreement was made no longer pertains
6387184 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6387185 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard
6387186 i wouldnt say it was my best performance in a northern ireland shirt we should remember it was only a friendly
6387187 its nice to receive a big bottle of champagne but its not going to get drunk in celebration ill simply put it in a cabinet
6387188 im content though with my display it was really nice to play at centre half
6387189 i dont think though it gives the manager a selection headache with aaron coming back hopefully for the slovakia game
6387190 the good thing is we are well served in defence
6387191 i am really excited this is obviously my first time playing at senior level and my first time playing at ravenhill in a while so yes i am really excited and looking forward to it in truth i cant wait for friday night
6387192 i will be really proud when i run out on friday night ulster is the team i always supported when i was growing up and obviously with david playing for ulster for ten years i have been a regular attendee to the games
6387193 matt williams talks a lot about the honour of playing for ulster rugby and wearing the red hand it is really easy to pick up on that if you are from ulster
6387194 the foreign players have to buy into it but once they see the dedication from the players and staff and the massive commitment and passion shown by the supporters it isnt hard for them to realise what it means to play for ulster matt talks about it but we are all aware of it and know it ourselves it is a great honour
6387195 clinton has a wealth of experience and what we are looking from him is that leadership as well as knowledge about the elvs
6387196 ed odonoghue is also an experienced guy who has been about a bit and is an abrasive player
6387197 we were pleased with the performance on friday against bath but we have a lot of work still to do and these friendlies are a great opportunity to see how the players are progressing and give the younger guys a chance as well
6387198 the magners league is just weeks away and we are determined to make a vast improvement on our results from last season we didnt have a good time last season winning the magners league and getting to the knock out stages of europe isnt beyond this squad
6387199 im still single im not seeing anyone im too busy most of the time to be honest
6387200 i got back home at the start of august and im here for a month this is like a holiday for me as it means i get to catch up with all my friends and family its brilliant seeing everyone again
6387201 im still with the same model agency and theyre great to work with so im heading back for the september season its all going really well
6387202 it is a very different scene and its a lot harder over there than in dublin but im absolutely loving it
6387203 while the highs of the job are really high there are also lots of downsides being a model is a very unstable job and when you do land big campaigns for vip clientele the pressure can be incredible
6387204 if youre at all insecure modelling can crush your self confidence every one thinks models must be really big headed but in reality it magnifies your insecurities ive learned not to take it personally though
6387205 david was always going to sign it was just a matter of him putting pen to paper
6387206 he is on a short term contract and both parties are happy with that
6387207 its now just a matter of david playing games and building up his fitness in the reserves and then well see when he is ready for the first team
6387208 we played a full scale practice match in training on tuesday night and david played half of that which will help him
6387209 no matter where he has been since he came back to linfield from liverpool and then onto crusaders david has scored goals
6387210 he doesnt have anything to prove to me he is a goalscorer and i expect him to keep doing that but there will be no pressure on him
6387211 he will be ready in his own time and be pushing for a place in the first team
6387212 that will give competition for places and that will be healthy for us
6387213 ryan was feeling really low after the match but i thought he had a fantastic debut up until the sending off
6387214 it was a harsh decision and the referee i suppose could have turned a blind eye yes there was contact after he came across the player but there was cover
6387215 hell just have to learn from the experience and its a really tough lesson he should be very proud of his performance as he handled himself very well on a difficult stage
6387216 the lad up until the sending off came through his debut with flying colours handled himself well looked composed and i can tell you he will get better and yes could follow the example set by jonny evans
6387217 i was so proud of the boys especially after going down to 10 men
6387218 we had key players missing and still played exceptionally well david healy and steve davis have hardly played in pre season and in the league but they were brilliant
6387219 we defended well and it was great to come away with a clean sheet something we talked about before the match because we havent recorded one in a while
6387220 now its decision time for the manager especially after jonny evans performance last night what does he do
6387221 aaron should be fit but its going to be very difficult for jonny not to be in the side for the game against slovakia jonny is so versatile that he gives nigel so many options
6387222 i was due to be with rangers for a week but at the end of that the reserve team manager tommy wilson asked me if i would like to stay on because they thought i had done well and there was potentially something on offer to me but they wanted to see more of me
6387223 i had been training at morecambe and was told they were going to make me an offer but then i pulled my hamstring in a match against preston
6387224 as it turns out that might have been a blessing in disguise
6387225 i had the chance to go to a couple of other clubs in england but when my agent rang me and said that rangers were interested in taking me for a week or two i jumped at the chance
6387226 i have supported rangers since i was a kid and it would be a dream come true for me to play for the club
6387227 i played a couple of games on tour down in england and have trained with the first team once or twice as well
6387228 i have enjoyed myself and i feel that i have been in good form while i have been here
6387229 now it is a waiting game for me i am booked into the hotel until saturday so i expect to find out one way or another by then
6387230 toen ik 17 was wilde ik graag zon tocht maken liefst nog over de axalp heen jullie zijn mietjes
6387231 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6387232 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6387233 i think theres a 10 million shortfall somewhere in their negotiations and theyre looking for a way to do that
6387234 its got to be something that the increased value thats generated by the stadium would be used to offset the cost
6387235 lighting science is honored to be part of new york citys project to test long lasting eco friendly lights to illuminate our world renowned streets and boroughs
6387236 we are proud to play an integral role in realizing this important carbon reduction goal we expect this project will herald a new era of led adoption and the continued greening of new york city
6387237 the new streetlight is the first of its kind and will set the new standard of lighting for city streets worldwide
6387238 the long lasting properties of led technology enhances security minimizes maintenance and the energy savings can be considerable as the technology develops rather than outdating itself in 20 years the lighting solution can evolve with technology and improve with age becoming less costly and consuming less energy over time

6387241 canadians stayed away from car dealer lots in june forced to spend much more of their hard earned cash at gas stations
6387242 softer job conditions a cooling housing market still high gas prices and a raft of dire headlines have hammered consumer confidence pointing to more modest spending growth in the months ahead
6387243 even so the outlook remains less downbeat than that facing the ultra stressed u s consumer
6387244 good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy this congress must act to encourage conservation promote technology build infrastructure and it must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil
6387245 our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improving the environment applause i have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation to develop cleaner technology and to produce more energy at home
6387246 consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run so i urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system promote conservation and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy
6387247 keeping america competitive requires affordable energy and here we have a serious problem america is addicted to oil which is often imported from unstable parts of the world the best way to break this addiction is through technology since 2001 we have spent nearly 10 billion
6387248 for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil
6387249 our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil
6387250 and so we discussed a variety of strategies about how to affect the supply of oil and one way that we can affect the supply of oil is to increase access to offshore exploration on the outer continental shelf once they solve this problem they can allow us to drill in northern alaska

6387259 they were young guys who started the hard way as caddies who were thrilled by a sport that they could not afford
6387260 my father learned discipline and intense concentration from the sport
6387261 it kept him healthy alert and very sharp right until his death
6387262 es war einfach ein einmaliges erlebnis hier zu sein nat rlich h tte es sportlich besser laufen k nnen aber olympia bleibt f r mich dennoch immer ein absolutes highlight das kann man mit einer welt oder europameisterschaft einfach nicht vergleichen 10 000 athleten in einem dorf das ist ein unglaubliches gef hl
6387263 wir sportler haben ja die h lfte der feier leider verpasst weil wir im benachbarten turnstadion auf den einmarsch warten mussten
6387264 da habe ich jetzt sehr viel zeit dar ber nachzudenken sicher werde ich erst einmal einige zeit nicht mehr spielen nach diesen olympischen spielen ist es einfach sehr schwer f r mich noch einmal die richtige motivation zu finden aber ich habe jetzt genug zeit dar ber nachzudenken und werde einige gespr che f hren um meine perspektiven in der deutschen mannschaft auszuloten da ist noch nichts definitiv entschieden aber jetzt z hlt erst einmal die nba
6387265 das war nat rlich sehr entt uschend in den letzten beiden minuten stand das spiel auf der kippe da h tten beide teams gewinnen k nnen da gab es sicher einige schiedsrichter entscheidungen die sehr zweifelhaft waren aber egal unsere leistung hat einfach in diesem turnier nicht ausgereicht und deshalb sind wir ausgeschieden wir haben unser gro es ziel das viertelfinale verfehlt das ist bitter
6387266 nat rlich waren alle spieler sehr entt uscht wir haben versucht die niederlage zu analysieren aber das ist nicht so einfach da berwiegt der frust ich konnte in der nacht danach bis f nf uhr nicht einschlafen weil mir immer wieder die entscheidenden szenen durch den kopf gegangen sind aber es hilft alles nichts es hat nicht gereicht
6387267 50 punkte unterschied ist nat rlich viel zu viel aber f r uns ging es einfach auch um nichts mehr die motivation war weg und das china spiel steckte uns noch in den knochen dennoch darf man so hoch eigentlich nicht verlieren auf der anderen seite sind die amerikaner bei olympia auch so b renstark dass sie niemand gef hrden wird die werden gold gewinnen ganz sicher
6387268 bevor ich nach peking kam h tte ich niemals gedacht was hier los sein wird und welche popularit t basketball in china hat ich werde hier auf der stra e erkannt und bei jedem spiel wurden wir von den chinesen angefeuert es ist ein sch nes gef hl auch hier so bekannt zu sein
6387269 am mittwoch war ich mit einigen spielern aus der mannschaft an der chinesischen mauer wirklich ein beeindruckendes erlebnis diese mauer muss man einmal im leben gesehen haben sonst hat man wirklich etwas verpasst wie die chinesen damals die mauer in die berge bauen konnten das wird mir immer ein r tsel bleiben ansonsten war ich nat rlich bei einigen anderen sportarten wie leichtathletik schwimmen oder beachvolleyball es macht einfach spa auch die anderen sportler zu unterst tzen und ihre sportarten bei olympia aus der n he zu erleben
6387270 ich habe das gl ck erst ende september wieder zur ck nach dallas zu m ssen
6387271 meine schwester hat gerade ein kind bekommen und ich bin zum zweiten mal onkel geworden ich freue mich tierisch darauf das neue baby zu sehen um das werde ich mich k mmern und schlichtweg versuchen mich zu erholen um f r die n chste nba saison topfit zu sein
6387272 nat rlich z hlen f r mich jetzt nur noch die nba und die dallas mavericks wir waren vor zwei jahren so nah dran an der krone hatten damals schon eine 2 0 f hrung in der finalserie diese scharte m chte ich unbedingt auswetzen daran setze ich alles
6387273 wir haben jetzt mit rick carlisle einen neuen trainer und haben einiges vor vielleicht kommen ja noch ein paar neue spieler dann sind wir allemal so stark um ernsthaft um den titel spielen zu k nnen

6387278 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6387279 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6387280 we are gratified to see that the hard work and dedication of our entire team continued to pay off in the second quarter
6387281 we expect that consumer purchasing power will continue to be pressured by ongoing weakness in the economy and we are maintaining our focus on offering great color great outfitting and great fashion at a tremendous value

6387298 nu mi se pare normal ca o companie care desfasoara afaceri pe teritoriul romaniei sa isi bata joc de statul roman si de cetateni este o forma de a ne forta mana pentru majorarea comisionului de la 4 la 6 si nu pot accepta
6387299 petrom lezeaza interesele publice pentru ca o mare parte din veniturile cnadnr provin din vanzarea rovinietelor astfel petrom lezeaza interesul public de mentinere a calitatii drumurilor

6387321 ministro lei alla farnesina da pochissimo e mi piacerebbe capire quali sono i punti che ha maggiormente condiviso della politica di chi lha preceduta penso allon massimo dalema e quali invece i punti sui quali il suo giudizio diverge in che modo cambier se cambier la politica estera italiana in medio oriente rispetto a quella del governo prodi
6387322 in primo luogo bisogna dire che la politica estera dellitalia ha avuto sempre degli assi portanti fondamentali e questi assi portanti lhanno caratterizzata direi indipendentemente dal colore politico dei governi
6387323 molto chiaro potrei proprio agganciarmi a questo scenario mediorientale le differenze emergono senza dubbio nel rapporto con hamas e anche sulla questione hezbollah ma per esempio la questione della risoluzione 1701 sembra mostrare almeno a detta di israele non tanto una questione di regole dingaggio quanto piuttosto di logica costitutiva della risoluzione stessa lei stesso poco fa vi accennava rispetto alliniziativa non solo militare ma pi propriamente politica che riguarda la situazione libanese questo governo che interlocutori intende assumere e che iniziative intende prendere
6387324 ma noi lo diciamo con grande chiarezza crediamo che lattuazione delle risoluzioni onu sul libano debba essere pi efficace di quanto non sia stato finora
6387325 sospendiamo i negoziati per formare il governo fino a che il quadro dellaccordo di doha non sar rispettato
6387326 senta spostando un po lattenzione dal quadrante mediorientale e ponendoci con una logica pi di fondo rispetto al problema delle risoluzioni onu un tema che si ripropone anche il recente vertice fao lha riproposto sui giornali lefficacia la congruit rispetto ai problemi degli organismi internazionali da questo punto di vista lei sa che i radicali ne hanno fatto un cavallo di battaglia soprattutto per quel che riguarda la parte istitutiva dellonu e la sua attuazione unorganizzazione delle democrazie dibattito che in questo momento appassiona anche il new york times e gli americani lei cosa pensa di questo aspetto del fatto che poi le decisioni vanno prese con paesi che non rispettano i diritti umani
6387327 ma guardi io su questo sono molto simpatetico da sempre con la posizione che i radicali hanno espresso quando fui ministro degli esteri laltra volta tra il 2002 e il 2004 rilanciai proprio allonu durante la presidenza italiana dellunione europea nel 2003 quella che allora nacque come la community of democracies che una grande rete globale di paesi democratici che si mettono insieme non per frustrare gli obiettivi dellonu ma per dire con grande chiarezza che noi crediamo nel multilateralismo ma vogliamo che sia un multilateralismo efficace basato sui diritti della persona sulla democrazia e quindi sulla promozione della democrazia nel mondo a questo concetto io resto ancora legato io credo che rilanciare la comunit delle democrazie come strumento non contro lonu ma per rafforzare lonu sia indispensabile io devo dire sinceramente che uno dei punti che vedo nella riforma dellonu non anzitutto il consiglio di sicurezza con un seggio permanente in pi o in meno ma il ruolo dellassemblea generale e della sua democraticit perch se c un blocco di paesi non democratici se c un paese che offende ogni secondo i diritti umani e poi mette il veto alla presa di decisioni che in qualche modo toccano grandissimi problemi beh questo un problema allora riflettendo sulla riforma delle nazioni unite questo aspetto della democraticit delle istituzioni io credo debba essere lanciato
6387328 si appena spenta leco delle polemiche sulle ultime affermazioni di ahmadinejad su israele in iran paese molto importante per litalia non solo economicamente esiste una societ dalle incredibili potenzialit il 70 della popolazione ha meno di trentanni non ha dunque vissuto n lepoca dello sci n i giorni della rivoluzione islamica ed sempre pi lontana nei sogni e nei desideri da chi la governa quale sar la vostra politica con liran idealismo realismo pragmatismo come procederete ci saranno contatti con i riformisti che negli ultimi anni hanno creato una sponda elettorale con il partito dellex presidente rafsanjani e con larijani nuovo presidente del parlamento e possibile avversario di ahmadinejad alle presidenziali del 2009
6387329 mah io credo che si debba distinguere tra il presidente delliran e il suo popolo il presidente delliran non pu essere per noi un interlocutore perch evidente che chi proclama la distruzione di israele o chi chiama grande satana i nostri amici americani pone un muro tra noi evidente che io distinguo il presidente dal suo popolo perch il popolo iraniano un popolo che ha con litalia unantica tradizione i nostri tecnici i nostri imprenditori che hanno fatto unesperienza di lavoro e la fanno tuttora in iran hanno intorno a s un ambiente di persone che apprezzano litalia quando il contesto iraniano era diverso noi avevamo contatti regolari con liran fummo tra quelli che sostenevano la necessit di negoziare un accordo commerciale e organico con leuropa io visitai tehran varie volte quando cera khatami presidente delliran quindi le componenti riformiste e progressiste delliran possono essere nostri interlocutori certo il presidente del parlamento neoeletto che sicuramente assai lontano dalla rigidit del presidente ahmadinejad un personaggio a cui noi guardiamo con interesse debbo dire con sincerit per altro che mentre in una prima fase ricordo ad esempio il cosiddetto movimento degli studenti sembrava poter emergere un movimento riformista davvero antagonista le ultime elezioni hanno dimostrato probabilmente sono gli effetti di un regime duro anzi durissimo che questa opposizione vera stata ridotta fortemente quindi fare certamente uno sforzo perch riemergano le forze dialoganti questo un obiettivo assoluto noi abbiamo bisogno di un dialogo con liran ma in queste condizioni lunica possibilit seria quella di seguire la strada che i grandi paesi europei francia germania e gran breta gna e gli stati uniti hanno seguito di rigore e di credibilit nelle sanzioni dicevamo prima del ruolo delle nazioni unite su un tema del genere le nazioni unite si giocano la loro credibilit esce un rapporto della genzia sullenergia atomica che ci dice che probabilmente violazioni ce ne sono state e molte e non accade nulla non si pu accettare se le sanzioni debbono esserci e credo che debbano esserci debbono essere poi anche attuate allora ecco perch litalia assume una posizione pi netta che nel recente passato alla fine negli ultimi giorni dello scorso governo il mio predecessore aveva forse finalmente compreso limportanza di dare un convinto sostegno a una linea che non fosse quella seguita da prodi di dialogo con ahmadinejad ma di fermezza pi noi saremo fermi pi io credo il popolo iraniano avr una possibilit di capire che lisolamento internazionale un danno per il popolo non so se sia un bene per il presidente di quel paese ma certo per il popolo un grande danno
6387330 a proposito di difesa di israele come vedrebbe un rapporto se non un ingresso di israele nellunione europea
6387331 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency the commission has delivered on that promise
6387332 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to an open internet
6387333 the communications act has long established the federal agencys authority to promote the competition consumer choice and diverse information across all communications platforms
6387334 extended these rights to internet users including the right to access the lawful content applications and services of their choice
6387335 the internet is a world wide system that does not belong to any one operator
6387336 the design of the internet protocols specifies clear limits on what operators can and cannot do happily the fcc recognized and exposed comcasts transgressions of those limits

6387347 we are not going to renew it and that shouldnt come as a surprise to anybody
6387348 not to be an i told you so but i was in jackson square and i predicted that new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city
6387349 our investigation has so far linked offences dating back to march 2007 with the most recent offence occurring at dartford in june this year
6387350 steve has had a little bit of a setback nothing major
6387351 we hoped he would be training this week but it looks likely to be next monday now
6387352 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6387353 and i can tell supporters that the rest of the season will be as exciting as this game because of the way we play this is our style we did it last year and we will do it again this year
6387354 but we didnt need this win to bring us belief we can compete at this level the belief might come from the outside after this but it has always been there on the inside
6387355 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
6387356 by bringing marek in i was trying to create competition in all areas of the pitch
6387357 it is important that paul robinson has genuine competition for his position and maybe the fact that marek cech was at the club contributed to the fact that paul gave such an outstanding performance on saturday
6387358 i have spoken with pedja mijatovic and with ramon calderon and they have said to me that robinho has to stay that he cant leave so we cant do anything because he is in contract for two more years at real madrid
6387359 robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that
6387360 so i have to say that until 31st august everything is possible until the transfer window is closed i cant say where robinho will play this season
6387361 were hoping to have one or two more players back from injury this weekend so we will wait and see
6387362 according to agreements the club spurs had until august 18 to send their proposals
6387363 they might be foreign but its important to bring in players who know the premier league
6387364 we didnt use the loan deal too much last year but this time we have been looking at that
6387365 paul jewell did make a bit of a joke about it saying i had only been at derby county for a month and already he had turned me into an international player
6387366 it has been a bit of a whirlwind moving to a new club and then getting the call up
6387367 i have spoken with pedja mijatovic and with ramon calderon and they have said to me that robinho has to stay that he cant leave so we cant do anything because he is in contract for two more years at real madrid
6387368 robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that
6387369 so i have to say that until 31st august everything is possible
6387370 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6387371 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6387372 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year
6387373 officially im on my last year of my contract ive had preliminary talks about extension and theres been interest from elsewhere
6387374 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6387375 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6387376 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6387377 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6387378 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
6387379 dougie did a good job for us last season there is no doubt about that
6387380 but hes 34 is an east london boy hes got four kids is happily married and hes obviously not going to move his family up here for what would be only a one or two year contract it would not be fair to ask him to live in a hotel for 12 months
6387381 we have to look forward not back our future is in youth
6387382 we need to improve on one or two things from saturday of course we do
6387383 im taking it steady and leaving nothing to chance but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
6387384 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever
6387385 the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked
6387386 well assess the situation on thursday where george is concerned
6387387 its his thigh mainly but this is a guy who almost went off in a neck brace and then collapsed needing oxygen in the changing room
6387388 this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
6387389 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100
6387390 dougie did a good job for us last season there is no doubt about that
6387391 but hes 34 is an east london boy hes got four kids is happily married and hes obviously not going to move his family up here for what would be only a one or two year contract it would not be fair to ask him to live in a hotel for 12 months

6387401 nana and i are very good friends we have been in touch after we worked together in pak pak pakaak when i get friendly with someone i make it a point not to lose contact

6387405 islamic courts troops and some local militias clashed today tuesday
6387406 although the fighting has ceased and calm has returned the town is still tense
6387407 i dont know its on its last legs but it deserves to be replaced whether its for something else in edinburgh or the east of scotland
6387408 i dont know if my actions could contribute towards saving a facility in scotland its not in my hands right now
6387409 but put it this way all i can say to you categorically if it wasnt for meadowbank i wouldnt be sitting here talking to you now in the first place

6387414 apakah kamu menganjurkan kebaikan kepada orang lain tetapi melupakan dirimu sendiri
6387415 ketika malam isra saya melihat orang orang yang digunting bibirnya dengan gunting dan ketika aku bertanya pada jibril siapakah mereka itu ya jibril jawabnya mereka pemimpin pemimpin dari ummatmu yang menganjurkan orang lain berbuat baik tetapi lupa pada diri sendiri padahal mereka membaca kitab allah s w t tetapi mereka tidak memperhatikan dan mengamalkannya
6387416 were hoping to have one or two more players back from injury this weekend so we will wait and see
6387417 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6387418 they might be foreign but its important to bring in players who know the premier league
6387419 steve has had a little bit of a setback nothing major
6387420 we hoped he would be training this week but it looks likely to be next monday now
6387421 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6387422 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6387423 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year
6387424 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
6387425 i have spoken with pedja mijatovic and with ramon calderon and they have said to me that robinho has to stay that he cant leave so we cant do anything because he is in contract for two more years at real madrid
6387426 robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that
6387427 so i have to say that until 31st august everything is possible
6387428 to look at the humanitarian situation with a special eye and how to help people who are suffering across the country

6387430 trabalhei tanto no meu salto com vara e outras atividades e quase como se isso n o importasse ningu m v isso ningu m me v
6387431 its a very different map than what weve looked at in the past were looking at states like alaska and georgia odd places for those of us who have been stuck in the map of the polarized american politics
6387432 i think its pretty clear that obama has his own set of strengths and his own set of weaknesses that make his candidacy not just historical but fairly unique
6387433 thats why this race is so close nationally despite the political environment totally going his way the fact this is a very close race nationally underscores challenges obama faces and not being seen as a leader
6387434 what he had to do to win the nomination has lost him a great deal on the other hand obama does have important advantages on bringing the right kind of change being on your side restoring our respect in the world those are also important presidential attributes
6387435 toward the beginning of this thing i was thinking if a republican was going to win i wish it was him
6387436 he was probably the best candidate i had but after ive seen all this other stuff and his campaigning is bothersome too ive lost almost all respect for him
6387437 just uh when obama talks he doesnt really say what he stands for you think mccain tells you what he really thinks yes
6387438 were spending too much money and too many people are dying that shouldnt be dying
6387439 this election is about two people if you go back to 1988 and look at the selection of dan quayle it was a major media firestorm at the time but proved not to be that significant in terms of how people voted
6387440 ultimately this is going to come down to the debates and how people judge mccain and obama against each other
6387441 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6387442 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6387443 if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6387444 mr ayers was a leader of the weather underground a terrorist group responsible for countless bombings against targets including the u s capitol the pentagon and numerous police stations courthouses and banks
6387445 who can claim a right to receive the body of christ

6387467 when they made eye contact its almost like the robbers went oh and they recognized the same employees

6387473 whats your opinion of the quality of care at the 13 state schools in texas
6387474 its the minimum quality you can provide without being sanctioned by the federal government
6387475 state schools should be one of the safest most caring environments for these people that typically have no ability to take care of themselves
6387476 youre talking about neglect in terms of services like occupational therapy speech therapy physical therapy
6387477 what the department of justice is doing is theyre looking at some different items than what our surveyors or regulatory surveyors would be looking at
6387478 its embarrassing that the department of justice has to come in and look at these things and hold us accountable
6387479 we have heard from individuals that weve represented at advocacy theyre calling and saying why is this person still here
6387480 people can act like you can do more with less but all you get is less
6387481 the reason theyre there is because they love these people

6387485 in big seizures theres a very strong tendency to ship ivory out of a different country than where its poached its a bit of a red herring
6387486 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6387487 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6387488 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something
6387489 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6387490 i eat and seduce everyone theres a lot of kissing everyone boys and girls all kinds of craziness
6387491 weve never had any complaints the guys who work round here have offered to write stating they have no objections there has never been an accident or staff injured but moving the van overnight would put staff at risk
6387492 we have been told if we have been here more than eight years we cant be forced to move
6387493 we can apply for planning permission but it would only be granted for five years and after that it would be put out to tender we could lose the spot weve been in for all these years so were looking for another option
6387494 its just this one official hes got a bee in his bonnet he doesnt have any objection to us staying here at peak hours but he does to us staying here from 8pm 6am which i find very strange
6387495 i have had a street traders licence at south gyle crescent for the last 11 years the snack van i own has been in the same fixed position for over 25 years and has never moved
6387496 in my view it seems ridiculous to ask 20 plus snack vans in close vicinity all to move during peak traffic hours
6387497 surely this has a greater risk of accidents to the public than to be left stationary
6387498 the result of this crackdown is great news for road safety in edinburgh
6387499 since car tax can only be purchased with a valid mot and insurance certificate it reduces the number of potentially dangerous untaxed uninsured and unroadworthy vehicles on the road
6387500 this helps to make the roads a safer place for everyone our figures show that eight out of ten cars impounded for being untaxed are also without insurance
6387501 from a drivers perspective the number of uninsured drivers or those without licences on the roads is probably of more concern
6387502 i do have concerns that the dvla records are notoriously unreliable there have been a number of cases where cars have been destroyed because of mistakes in the dvla database or by its on street enforcers
6387503 from an international level having this one facility in glasgow is fine but from a grassroots point of view we need two three or even four across scotland because parents wont be able to take their kids through to glasgow all the time to train
6387504 all we need in edinburgh is a 200m track that can be placed inside a building it doesnt have to be international standard
6387505 this is scotlands capital city and i think the current regime has the responsibility to maintain and improve facilities for future generations
6387506 we committed to over 30m of investment in sports facilities in our last budget and i think thats a very strong sign in terms of this administrations commitment to sport
6387507 we are investing millions in new grassroots facilities across scotland helping increase participation and nurture our sporting stars of tomorrow
6387508 if new owners were to come onboard or baa were to sell glasgow we would expect that there would be substantial investment in edinburgh in order to compete effectively with glasgow especially on long haul routes
6387509 we will be looking to plan which routes to operate the boeing dreamliner aircraft we have on order a key factor when deciding whether we will fly from glasgow or edinburgh will be the services available for these long haul aircraft
6387510 there are differences in the airports infrastructure and this is likely to change if they were in competition
6387511 there are issues about the number of long haul direct flights that go into edinburgh and there has been criticism in the past that baa has been slow to invest in edinburgh in this regard
6387512 any suggestion that this airport may be sold could seriously put at risk the citys economic future
6387513 we could not welcome anything which might risk the competitive position of the city

6387518 mas eu vejo uma vontade enorme dos jogadores em sair dessa se eu n o detectasse essa entrega a cada jogo diria que o risco de cair seria grande mas pela ra a que eles est o demonstrando o santos tem tudo para sair da zona em poucas rodadas
6387519 eu dizia sempre que s passaria a ter respeito da torcida do santos caso eu provasse meu potencial em campo espero ter agradado
6387520 n o sabia que um torcedor deu soco no peito do molina que coisa feia por isso que cada vez mais os jogadores acabam saindo do brasil aqui na ucr nia os torcedores aplaudem na vit ria e na derrota

6387524 paul is excited about going on tour initially he wanted to go it alone with just his band and road crew with family flying out every now and again but now he wants nancy to be with him all the way
6387525 he says he had the time of his life on the road trip with nancy i think it really sealed things for him he enjoys nancys company so much
6387526 its just water and raw apple cider vinegar and it just cleans out your system entirely
6387527 it will be a major event that will celebrate scotland in a city like edinburgh we are used to having international performers on our doorstep but a growing number of people also want to celebrate their own history and culture
6387528 it will be a car version of the edinburgh cow parade and i think it will definitely capture the imagination as a major one off event the cow parade was a real mix of professional art and art at a community level and this should be similar
6387529 the cow parade which had the whole of edinburgh talking when it hit town two years ago showed the impact that a community art event can have and we have high hopes that the car parade will be a similar success
6387530 there will be so much going on in edinburgh next year from art exhibitions to events including the gathering when more than 8000 clansmen and women from around the world will descend on edinburgh
6387531 anti littering laws are applicable to all city residents and visitors including city of edinburgh council employees
6387532 whilst most people are law abiding individuals who drop litter can be issued with a 50 fixed penalty notice the message is simple if you drop litter you can be fined if you fail to pay the fine you will be reported to the procurator fiscal environmental wardens patrol all areas of the city
6387533 recently a member of staff from waverley court was served with a 50 fixed penalty notice and reported to the procurator fiscal for smoking related litter littering by council staff is a particular embarrassment to the council
6387534 we all represent the council during work hours and the public expect a high standard of behaviour wardens will continue to regularly patrol the areas outside council buildings
6387535 the city centre and parks teams have been working hard to clean up the city centre and improve its visual appearance we would expect this effort to be supported by staff in council buildings by being vigilant about litter
6387536 in particular we would encourage staff to dispose of cigarette litter in the bins provided managers of staff without e mail access should make sure their staff are aware of the content of this message
6387537 this person must feel a bit of a twit to be served with a fine by a council colleague
6387538 it is an embarrassment for the council council workers and councillors have to be careful not to bring embarrassment to their employers
6387539 if anyone drops litter they have to pay the consequences i can never understand why people dont put cigarette butts in the litter bins
6387540 a lot of people were given them in the 16th century but there were none left as they were all melted down except for the one worn by the lord mayor of london whose provenance goes back to 1520
6387541 but its only 10 to 20 per cent original and the rest of it has been added or repaired this one has had metallurgic tests and is 100 per cent original
6387542 its provenance had been traced to the 1700s but in tests it was found that it is gold alloy which was only used between 1546 and 1552
6387543 more than 55 000 people die in scotland each year palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers

6387547 so i typed in her name and hers was the first picture that popped up
6387548 the first thing i asked him was have you had a good life
6387549 i just want to give him a big hug and even though hes a man and not a little boy i just want to hold him until theres no tomorrow
6387550 i just didnt know how to act it was like it was the missing jigsaw to my whole life
6387551 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6387552 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6387553 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6387554 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans

6387559 campbell did it with the prevalent fuel of the day were doing it with the prevalent fuel of tomorrow
6387560 donald campbell had his massive cubic capacity engines and energy dense fossil fuels we have just the wind
6387561 but the wind will still be here in 50 or 100 years time the age of renewables has been a long time coming back but will endure
6387562 we need the weather to come right the lake is wet at the moment and it should be dry this time of year and we need the wind window which is coming any day now
6387563 the lake is 500 sq km and is a salt lake so its very flat and we can sail in any direction it has some good wind as well but its really the space we need
6387564 wind powered cars are the way of the future were going to have our prototype on the road in december
6387565 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6387566 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6387567 perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts
6387568 from roaming about on the earth and walking around on it
6387569 have you considered my servant job for there is no one like him on the earth a blameless and upright man fearing god and turning away from evil
6387570 hast thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has on every side
6387571 but put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has he will surely curse thee to thy face
6387572 behold all that he has is in your power only do not put forth your hand on him
6387573 the oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them and the sabeans attacked and took them they also slew the servants with the edge of the sword and i alone have escaped to tell you
6387574 the fire of god fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i alone have escaped to tell you
6387575 the chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword and i alone have escaped to tell you
6387576 your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brothers house and behold a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house and it fell on the young people and they died and i alone have escaped to tell you
6387577 the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
6387578 i see youve been training in the art of the druid

6387591 if i can make it there ill make it anywhere
6387592 so why did i wait to live till it was time to die
6387593 anyone who visits calton hill will realise that investment is needed in the area
6387594 but theres a combination of new business and new development coming to the area which is raising the tone and bringing life back to what has been quite a quiet and sometimes deserted area we can combine that with contributions towards physical improvements
6387595 there are a lot of people who will never go to calton hill after dusk and i can understand why but its a fantastic view they miss out on and i think everyone should be able to see it at nighttime
6387596 calton hill is an important heritage spot that attracts tourists and its iconic not only to look at but to look from
6387597 i do get representations from all over the city asking if we can do something about it
6387598 surely the squanderers are the fellows of the shaitans and the shaitan is ever ungrateful to his lord
6387599 and do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it forth to the utmost limit of its stretching forth lest you should afterwards sit down blamed stripped off
6387600 among the inmates of hell a person who has led the most luxurious life in this world will be brought up on the day of resurrection and dipped in the fire and will be asked o son of adam did you ever experience any comfort did you happen to get any luxury he will reply by allah no and then one of the people of jannah who had experienced extreme misery in the life of this world will be dipped in jannah then will be asked o son of adam did you ever experience any misery did you ever encounter difficulty he will say by allah no i neither experienced misery nor passed through hardship

6387605 he was obviously credible to the extent that he was given the keys for a red cross vehicle and as it happened an incident did take place
6387606 mr gleeson got into a car with emergency signage and blue lights and drove to this incident
6387607 it was obvious to members of the fire service there that he should not have been in attendance
6387608 we have tightened up our procedures in conjunction with the red cross to prevent an incident like this happening again
6387609 just to clarify were gonna be playing some stuff thats unfinished no one wants to hear a square boring set in somewhere like this do they

6387619 the profit before interest and tax for the continuing businesses expressed on a constant currency basis was up 9 4 per cent this increase continues the positive momentum established over the past 18 months
6387620 the strategy for pet packaging of focusing on the higher growth custom containers segment where it has a strong market position supported by industry leading technology has been correct with returns for the business increasing from 9 2 to 12 per cent over the past two years
6387621 the business has made substantial progress in recovering these increases via contractual pass throughs
6387622 earnings for the year were up strongly as the business continued to lower its cost base improve product mix and recover raw material cost increases
6387623 the short term outlook for raw material input costs is for stability at the current high levels in the medium term lower cost polymer capacity is scheduled to commence production and it is likely resin supplier margins will reduce at that time
6387624 this plant will be a global leader in extrusion lamination and is ideally located in a high growth low cost region

6387630 ik bestudeer het baikalmeer al heel lang aanvankelijk vooral de tektonische structuur later verschoof de focus meer richting paleoklimaatonderzoek
6387631 sinds 2000 houdt onze onderzoeksgroep zich vooral bezig met methaanuitstoten in het meer het baikalmeer is het enige zoetwatermeer waar zulke methaanbronnen met gashydraten een verbinding van ijs en gas bestaan en we hebben ontdekt dat moddervulkanen daar iets mee te maken hebben
6387632 concreet willen we bestuderen hoe die moddervulkanen precies werken hoeveel methaan ze loslaten welke invloed dat heeft op de omgeving we willen ook kijken of er specifieke fauna en flora leeft op en rond die methaanbronnen

6387639 temple hair or rather the idea of it has become fashionable in the west but you must remember that tirupati and all the indian temples together contribute only 20 out of every 100 locks of premium hair sold abroad in an extremely fast growing market
6387640 in many cases we fear women are being exploited there are growing concerns over the indian hair trade
6387641 there are no specific restrictions on the import and export of human hair and it can be done freely this is obviously an environment that breeds illegality

6387645 we think newspaper stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry

6387669 there seems to be among average churchgoers a nagging suspicion a fear that the scholars those who are really in the know have proved the faith is all wrong in the universities the laboratories and even the seminaries theyve found out the bible is mostly false and the message of christ is a big hoax but the rest of the world just hasnt quite caught on yet

6387718 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment

6387742 we have a lot of options at this position but im looking for ezinne to be the leader of our defense
6387743 along with her we have two outstanding defenders in celeste and kim they are the type of players that can shut down sideline to sideline and make it difficult for the opponent to score jenna also will have a huge role this season
6387744 one area that was addressed this year was the midfield position because we suffered some misfortunes last season
6387745 since some of our key players are coming back we have an experienced group i also think we have good players coming in can step into key situations and we will not miss a beat on offense
6387746 our strikers are very good at attacking and putting pressure on the defense
6387747 we are expecting great things from them because when their game is on they are unstoppable
6387748 were looking forward to a very competitive schedule both in non conference and conference
6387749 playing these teams confirms our commitment to building a championship program
6387750 algunas teor as dicen que los agujeros negros peque os en los c mulos globulares deber an hundirse en el centro y formar uno de tama o medio pero nuestro descubrimiento sugiere que esto no es as
6387751 si un agujero negro de tama o intermedio estuviese acretando este material no ser a demasiado grande de acuerdo con esto
6387752 pero si un agujero negro peque o estuviese acretando este material ser a demasiado para l parte del material ser a expulsado en forma de fuertes vientos

6387754 we are now eight months into these negotiations and while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6387755 negotiators in accra can break the deadlock between developed and developing countries
6387756 ultimately all nations need to tackle climate change together and in accra the rich countries can live up to their full potential ideally led by an eu that teams up with the emerging economies
6387757 each game brings it own challenges hartlepool have started brilliantly its a hard place to go and get a result
6387758 they will have a partisan crowd and wholehearted players and it will be a tough challenge for us the two points that weve picked up in the league from very respectable draws will mean nothing if we go there and lose
6387759 is creating a beautiful and expansive world for multiple platforms this fall with world of zellians

6387761 il rapporto tra noi e la lega forte e consolidato non unalleanza tattica n semplicemente numerica la lega esprime esigenze complementari a quelle di chi vota per noi i valori di riferimento sono comuni e i programmi sono omogenei
6387762 il federalismo fiscale ha detto il premier silvio berlusconi non solo un tema della lega la riforma della giustizia non interessa solo noi la lega si esprime con un linguaggio diverso dal nostro per la vedo in un ruolo complementare al nostro un rapporto che almeno in parte potrebbe somigliare a quello che unisce in germania cdu e csu
6387763 la sudditanza psicologica e politica del pd verso le frange giustizialiste sconcertante credo di non essere il solo deluso in questo da veltroni credo che altrettanto delusi siano molti dei suoi sostenitori
6387764 quanto alla giustizia si tratta di mettere in pratica molte delle idee di giovanni falcone separazione dellordine degli avvocati dellaccusa dallordine dei magistrati indirizzo dellazione penale superando lattuale ipocrisia della finta obbligatoriet criteri meritocratici nella valutazione del lavoro dei magistrati
6387765 del tutto evidente che non permetteremo mai alla magistratura di esercitare una supplenza rispetto al potere legislativo cosa che alcuni magistrati tendono a fare su questo come su altri temi

6387768 i have just been told that arsenal are interested as well but my position is clear i want to start the season with everton
6387769 what rennes are currently offering me is far behind my demands both clubs have to find an agreement to help me leave
6387770 im aware that my directors have declared i wont leave but its just a means to make my price higher i understand their position and i would do the same
6387771 its politics regarding what ive heard i know general manager pierre dreossi is ready to let me leave from my part i dont want to play for rennes anymore
6387772 personally i dont worry because english clubs have the resources to sign me when they really want a player they are ready to spent whatever amount
6387773 im hopeful it will be done by next week that kind of opportunity only happens once everton offer me 1 5 million 1 2 million whereas i dont earn the half of it at rennes
6387774 even if i owe everything to this club rennes i have a family to feed regardless the challenge which is very interesting

6387777 a elimina o na libertadores doeu bastante mas l gico que isso n o a culpa pelos maus resultados acho que n o houve um encaixe correto n o houve equil brio no esquema de jogo
6387778 mas eu vejo uma vontade enorme dos jogadores em sair dessa se eu n o detectasse essa entrega a cada jogo diria que o risco de cair seria grande mas pela ra a que eles est o demonstrando o santos tem tudo para sair da zona em poucas rodadas
6387779 eu dizia sempre que s passaria a ter respeito da torcida do santos caso eu provasse meu potencial em campo espero ter agradado
6387780 n o sabia que um torcedor deu soco no peito do molina que coisa feia por isso que cada vez mais os jogadores acabam saindo do brasil aqui na ucr nia os torcedores aplaudem na vit ria e na derrota
6387781 o shevchenko e o kaladze sa ram daqui do dynamo para o milan n o todo dia que seremos capa de jornal mas a visibilidade grande a ucr nia est no principal mercado ainda mais se conseguirmos acesso liga dos campe es

6387800 neste ano os resultados de todos foram muito vari veis e cada um ganhou provas e deixou de pontuar em outras ocasi es
6387801 n o perdemos nada por m precisamos conseguir melhores resultados de forma cont nua
6387802 a partir deste momento cada disputa ser fundamental e cada ponto muito valioso
6387803 n o podemos perder pontos dessa maneira temos que ser t o competitivos como em budapeste mas necessitamos aumentar a nossa confiabilidade n o podemos repetir certos erros j n o temos mais desculpas
6387804 nosso time n o tem aquele cara no meio que receba a bola e determine o ritmo do jogo n s n o temos meias e o ataque sofre mais por causa disso
6387805 n s temos muita jogada de ultrapassagem por isso preciso ter os piv s na rea para o lateral dar a bola e ir em porto alegre contra o gr mio isso n o funcionou tanto porque n s n o prendemos a defesa deles l dentro contra o atl tico pr foi diferente e o time inteiro joga mais
6387806 ele tem um passe muito bom e se projeta bem infelizmente como todo o nosso time ele ainda abusa um pouco da velocidade isso acontece quando voc n o tem algu m para dosar o ritmo
6387807 nosso time j mostrou que tem condi es de ganhar em qualquer local
6387808 j fiz essa fun o no s o paulo e estou pronto para ajudar da melhor forma que puder
6387809 o maxi esteve bem nos dois ltimos jogos e merece essa chance j o obina rendeu bem quando entrou durante as partidas mas n o quando come ou jogando por isso mudei
6387810 ele precisa de seq ncia de jogos esteve bem contra o santos empate em 2 a 2 no domingo e agora ter um contato maior com a torcida
6387811 fiquei sabendo que esse jogador j estava descartado mas de qualquer maneira prefiro valorizar o ygor o romeu o fabinho os jogadores que aqui est o e nos ajudando na nossa caminhada
6387812 seria anti tico se ficasse falando de um ou outro jogador diante de um grupo t o aguerrido como este do fluminense

6387814 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
6387815 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
6387816 people are being allowed through on the basis of this technology it means that 95 per cent of people wont be checked in any way other than by the machine
6387817 instead of pressing ahead with new unproven technology to replace current immigration staff the government should answer our calls to establish a dedicated uk border police which is vital to securing our borders
6387818 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6387819 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6387820 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6387821 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the starts we will be okay
6387822 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6387823 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6387824 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6387825 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6387826 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6387827 we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers

6387830 the dollar has been undermined by renewed concerns over the health of the us financial system
6387831 we might see some further scaling back of already diminished expectations for the federal reserve to raise us interest rates over the next six months

6387834 agreed to a fee award of 8 5 of the settlement to be paid in a mixture of cash and stock
6387835 a recovery that is both excellent and historic in magnitude
6387836 independent analysis of the factors laid out by the second circuit in goldberger v integrated resources inc 209 f 3d 43 50 2d cir 2000
6387837 court concluded that the requested 8 5 fee was excessive and instead concluded that a 3 fee was a fair and reasonable award
6387838 a 3 fee was consistent with fees granted in similar cases
6387839 given the district courts careful analysis of the goldberger factors we conclude that the fee award here does not fall outside the bounds of the district courts discretion
6387840 i am sorry for what i did that 25 year old man i dont think he appreciated the life he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 that i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is
6387841 for my consciences sake i felt the lord had told me to plead guilty at that time and i did

6387844 i had braces and glasses and a big curly fro
6387845 i wasnt necessarily too active in getting into the social crowd so i definitely understand not fitting in
6387846 we will miss him forever its always easier to leave than to be left
6387847 we appreciate yall being here it has not been a good day for us but theres nobody id rather be with than all my family up here on the stage
6387848 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6387849 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6387850 is there anyone who insults you or puts you down
6387851 is there anyone who has taken your money or belongings without your ok or prevented you from getting them even when you ask
6387852 is there anyone who hits kicks slaps or throws things at you
6387853 the prime minister of jamaica told me everybody is in the streets ive written history im just real proud
6387854 im looking forward to going to bed waking up and realizing im a double gold medalist ive been dreaming of breaking the 200 meter record since i was yea high
6387855 hes five to seven years from his prime if he stays healthy focused and motivated were going to see some of the most incredible things weve ever seen in sports
6387856 i could see him running the 400 meters i could see him running the 800 in six seven years his talent is virtually untapped
6387857 i dont compare myself a lot im just trying to be me he revolutionized the sport i just changed it a little bit
6387858 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6387859 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6387860 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6387861 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6387862 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6387863 this is an excellent time for an event like this its kitten season we have a lot of cats and
6387864 others including the international olympic committee arrange their rankings by gold medals won
6387865 nobody in his right mind would claim that a country winning 15 silver medals should be ranked lower than a country winning a single gold medal
6387866 would rather live in the united states as a loser than in china as a winner
6387867 while many of taiwan s people are chinese migr s from the mainland or descendants of migr s the people native to the island are taiwanese
6387868 im better than you because the country i happen to be born in had other people born in who ive never met interacted with or seen other than in the newspaper or on the internet once or twice happen to have done a little better in an international sporting event than someone in your country
6387869 see the games as between athletes not countries nonetheless placed list countries in a order based on gold number too the ranking system used by most us media outlets to me is an unnecesary show of lack of confidence
6387870 the times is doing a much better job than 99 of the american media
6387871 taiwan an island which china regards as a breakaway province
6387872 the national media of all the countries who compete at these games display the medal table accordingly with the exception of the us
6387873 i do not know why non americans are so concerned about how the american media report the olympics to their own people
6387874 the us is probably the only country that refuses to get rid of english units of measurement
6387875 hurray we won 4 gold 3 siler and 7 bronze today in beijing it is going to be one of the many olympics that usa participated and achieved scores comparable to the top 5 nations blah blah blah
6387876 mens shooting 50m free rifle 3 positions 3 40 shots
6387877 what i like most about coaching is the competition and the relationships ive built with the players
6387878 i even like practice you cant become great if you dont have practice
6387879 they pick and sing every other week he loves it bob could always sing and he taught himself how to play guitar i guess for accompaniment
6387880 he might be more laid back now but he can still get in your face if he needs to thats what i liked about him
6387881 he is an easy man to talk to and one that everyone has respect for and that says a lot about the person he is
6387882 finally my mother told reilly to make sure his grandfather really had a penny in one of his hands
6387883 as it turned out the penny was in his pocket and he was just dying from laughing so hard
6387884 my dad has the prettiest basketball shot youve ever seen
6387885 i coached against him many times and it wasnt fun
6387886 simply put he enjoys coaching and the relationships he has with coaches kids parents ex players teachers and game officials on friday nights
6387887 in our last dialogue on retiring bob said why would i want to do that
6387888 you never want to get injured but i think in the games ive played ive showed that im a top player
6387889 i dont think there is any pressure on him since we play different positions
6387890 he does what he does and i did what i did
6387891 its nice to be with the rest of the sportsmen of the world said
6387892 i have enjoyed talking to so many people from different sports that you dont know much about there is lots of respect going both ways
6387893 im having a blast in the athletes village ive gotten to know the german handball team and the mens and womens field hockey teams and our table tennis and track athletes
6387894 its such a more interesting experience than staying in a hotel
6387895 it sure beats our experience in athens when we were docked on a ship
6387896 weve mingled weve been sightseeing weve attended a bunch of other events we really feel a part of something bigger here
6387897 usc played one of their best matches of the year its like the ncaa basketball tournament you have to be able to raise the level of your play when youre up against a team having its career night
6387898 thats our motto start here end here were going to end in nebraska knock on wood
6387899 tells it straight some recruiters can be shady and promise you playing time hes not he tells you straight
6387900 back in the day it used to be usa russia russia usa all the time and were finally getting back to that level

6387906 on the one hand i guess i understand why people make a big deal out of it
6387907 but for golfers its really not a big thing its the rule and its just what you are supposed to do golfers learn that early on in a case like this if you dont call a penalty on yourself youre really cheating the rest of the field
6387908 its kind of why golf is like life in general
6387909 you are expected to do or should do the right thing
6387910 these are legitimate questions and we are aware of the concerns
6387911 the age question is one thing residency can be difficult to prove where is somebodys real permanent residence that can get tough
6387912 kalau teman teman membantah tak apa apa tetapi saya kasihan saja

6387914 i was one of the younger guys in dallas here im one of the older guys so its a different role for me
6387915 i was used to being around a group of veterans who pretty much had everything down really professional here guys are still trying to learn their way
6387916 ive been into my playbook here and trying to get our defense down once i get there well see how i feel
6387917 i can get in a receivers face get my hands on him a little bit
6387918 hes got that very good burst and thats important when youre up on guys like we like to play
6387919 the key thing is hes got what a lot of people dont have and thats speed
6387920 hes been a lot of help to me ever since he went down
6387921 hes definitely on my back all the time its starting to get annoying hes in my ear more than secondary coach dave campo
6387922 that shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that
6387923 the day he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he has stayed on me ever since then
6387924 he has great feet good technique its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there
6387925 it shows a lot of people are believing in me he said
6387926 i learned after the game when i got schooled on that in the end zone that once the quarterback rolls out of the pocket i can pretty much steer the receiver where i want to
6387927 in college you cant touch the receiver past 5 yards
6387928 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6387929 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6387930 we wanted to get a number of really good teams together in a pool play bracket tournament the first week of the season and we had a good turnout with good competition
6387931 weve been flying under the radar and not getting much recognition so far but this is a big time event
6387932 there were some good teams here and it gave us an opportunity to experiment and do some different things
6387933 that was so not real darth vader would have never turned good
6387934 what brought him in contact with those people was not part of his routine
6387935 being in that park on some type of security check was not part of his assignment
6387936 the list will concentrate no 1 on all of the people who made it happen
6387937 there are these scenes in rodanthe and you just get the wind swept austere beauty of the outer banks
6387938 its co mingled with a story that im proud to have written and that translated well to film
6387939 its not often you have a movie named after the place that it actually was filmed so weve got a lot of opportunities
6387940 if everybody switched to organic farming we couldnt support the earths current population maybe half
6387941 the more we can grow on already cultivated land the better
6387942 if i said that was a great softball game it would be an understatement
6387943 well have a fresh cat said candrea of former texas longhorns great cat osterman who pitched one inning in relief wednesday
6387944 she wasnt going to try to dance anything by me
6387945 we want to play the defending champs i mean its all about challenge argentina theyre the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6387946 im glad duke doesnt play saint marys this season u s coach mike krzyzewski said
6387947 you knew there would be no stopping them once they got rolling in the second half
6387948 he happens to be an immigrant who is in need of desperate medical attention round the clock and the hospital under federal law and i believe the laws of the state of illinois have got to provide the necessary care for this individual
6387949 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6387950 ever wished real life could be as romantic as a novel
6387951 what would i take if i was living in a caravan or a boat
6387952 oh god i have to get up now and go to work and i could have done with an extra couple of hours in bed i hate my job i wish i didnt have to go i really hate my job oh god how i hate my job

6387960 we are witnessing a shift back toward balance versus the heat everyone had felt a year ago around the facebook ecosystem that felt like it could be the next new thing with unbounded upside
6387961 while that ecosystem is still interesting its become crowded and users have shown enough signs of app fatigue that the doors are closing
6387962 whats unclear is can one application company on facebook build a few hundred million dollar business im personally skeptical
6387963 you need to be cross platform you need to control your customer you need to be on facebook myspace hi5 bebo and essentially have your app available throughout the internet
6387964 for the non web savvy a widget company invokes negative images of a commodity product
6387965 at the same time it doesnt sound from an investor perspective that youre investing in something thats shallow and not indicative of the amount of time put into the technology
6387966 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6387967 all of the language on the site will be shifting
6387968 a lot of people are skeptical about how were monetized but growth is there and theres a lot of potential upside
6387969 the best we can do is keep growing and make sure were the destination of choice for advertisers
6387970 businesses that are building traffic first have to show much larger traffic numbers or have a more thoughtful plan to monetize their business in order to be convincing
6387971 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6387972 the vcs are taking a step back but whats the reality behind this is that it takes a long time for marketers to understand where their customers are at

6387976 si on faisait des exp riences cela serait moins pr occupant mais on dirait bien que cest son quipe type certains joueurs sont m connaissables on change le manager qui prend les m mes joueurs ce sont les meilleurs mais il ne performent pas pour langleterre et on continue les prendre

6387978 were focusing our atom supply on the eee pc 901 1000 and 1000h models
6387979 they are much higher performance and a much more demanding environment
6387980 that was just another risk reduction step to prove the aircraft was not leaking fuel and the engines were behaving nominally
6387981 it was a full functional check flight of about 55 minutes
6387982 we asked them point blank if they noticed any difference in performance and they said it was a non event
6387983 in other words they couldnt tell the difference the aircraft behaved the same
6387984 well have two more sorties then the robins engineers will put their final analysis and reports together
6387985 hopefully they will grant us the certification to use the fuel operationally if need be
6387986 weve scheduled an aerial refueling demonstration aug 28 between both aircraft
6387987 both will be flying on the synthetic blend and the kc 135 will be passing it to the f 22 in flight
6387988 were trying to get them through the process as expeditiously and safely as possible we want to prove that our fleet can use a different fuel so that we can encourage industry to develop alternative sources
6387989 the test was very well thought out and very well run by the engineers the maintenance team and the pilots flying the aircraft
6387990 the marine corps does not tolerate any misconduct from its marines because its not in keeping with our core values of honor courage and commitment
6387991 if allegations are substantiated marines are held accountable under the uniform code of military justice as well as by local state or federal law
6387992 i thought i knew the marine corps and what they were about
6387993 currently were not aware of any breach in our policies or procedures
6387994 as we get more information well obviously look very deeply into it and make sure were safeguarding the safety and security of our students
6387995 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6387996 einige schl sselmitglieder unserer organisation haben eine sehr schlechte entscheidung getroffen und die schuld liegt zu 100 prozent bei uns
6387997 wir sind sehr entt uscht dar ber dass nascar auch die fahrer auf bew hrung gesetzt hat denn sie hatten keinerlei kenntnis von diesem vorfall und waren darin auch in keinster weise verwickelt
6387998 its amazing how many times youre casually in the sun without realizing it all the freckles and leathery skin thats a result of cumulative sun damage amp sun exposure there are a lot of golfers tennis players gardeners and whole lot of other people that simply wont use a topical for whatever reason which makes the sunpill a timely option for year round protection
6387999 il pilota era partito ed rientrato dopo aver avvertito qualcosa qualcosa che sar la commissione dinchiesta a stabilire

6388001 ogni anno milioni di persone si muovono per il mondo in tutta comodit e sicurezza e come scrive una rivista la possibilit di morire uguale a quella di far uscire testa per 21 volte di seguito lanciando una moneta in aria
6388002 the defendant was arrested as he was placing a bomb inside the house that belonged to a displaced family in the neighbourhood
6388003 the warrants accused him of murder and displacing people in al adel neighbourhood
6388004 we strongly denounce this heinous act we are shocked by this barbaric action that was carried out by executive bodies against national figures
6388005 it is an attempt to target me as i am always demanding the release of prisoners and talking against sectarianism
6388006 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two
6388007 accepted that much of the story published in the mail on sunday was false
6388008 he was a police driver making out he was an armed special protection officer
6388009 the authors have admitted that there were falsehoods in the original manuscript and have made amendments accordingly
6388010 die gr nde sind haupts chlich die zuwanderung aus dem s den aber auch aus deutschland
6388011 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6388012 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6388013 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6388014 apple is cool can anyone even recall a microsoft ad no
6388015 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6388016 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6388017 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6388018 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6388019 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6388020 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6388021 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6388022 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6388023 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6388024 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6388025 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6388026 fireproof picks up seven years into a marriage headed for divorce and the question is can a cold marriage revive why stay together
6388027 fireproof doesnt mean that a fire will never come but that when it comes youll be able to withstand it
6388028 ein grund liegt in der rapide angestiegenen anzahl der pekinger hotels
6388029 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
6388030 we know what messages will work and what will not
6388031 today i got an e mail from the university they want me to get an hiv test maybe it part of health insurance
6388032 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6388033 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined medical doctors and neurosurgeons from huron hospital and cleveland clinic sadly report that at 6 12 p m congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones died she dedicated her life in public service to helping others and will continue to do so through organ donations please keep her family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time
6388034 but it gets a lot of play on fox news
6388035 by combining the complementary strengths and product offerings of ericsson and st in platforms and semiconductors the joint venture is well positioned to become a world leader
6388036 the industry continues to develop at a swift pace and customers see benefits from our broad offering this partnership is a perfect fit and secures a complete offering as well as the necessary scale for technology leadership
6388037 effectively these are yesterdays migrants as well as todays migrants contributing to this high level of population growth
6388038 one is an increase in the fertility rates for both uk and non uk born mums but also its because recent migrants have changed the number of people in that age band child bearing age
6388039 als we zien dat banken wel erg afhankelijk worden van centrale banken dan moeten we ze stimuleren andere financieringsbronnen aan te snijden
6388040 er een eind is aan hoe lang je dit kunt doen er komt een punt dat je de markt overneemt
6388041 onze mannen waren niet in de positie om te reageren en vielen volgens alle aanwijzingen in de eerste minuten
6388042 inlichtingen en kennis van het terrein voor het begin van de missie zodat we het maximale kunnen doen om een dergelijke verrassende onvoorspelbare aanval te voorkomen
6388043 we moeten er over nadenken zodat het niet weer gebeurt althans niet onder deze omstandigheden
6388044 the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with never say a word then walk
6388045 this passion wont go away obama and mccain will have to answer to the women of america

6388047 make clear what the consequences may very well be for the democratic party if they do not
6388048 por la paz el rock y la convivencia entre culturas
6388049 whatever momentum that obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost it
6388050 it is not a dead heat but it is close
6388051 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains an important part of the election
6388052 each game brings it own challenges hartlepool have started brilliantly its a hard place to go and get a result
6388053 they will have a partisan crowd and wholehearted players and it will be a tough challenge for us the two points that weve picked up in the league from very respectable draws will mean nothing if we go there and lose
6388054 the reduction in pollution happens during a stage of the life cycle when the rice plant is producing grain this period is normally associated with around half of all methane emissions from rice and we found that simulated acid rain pollution reduced this emission by 24 per cent
6388055 we had similar results when exposing natural wetlands to simulated acid rain but this could be more important since natural wetlands are mostly located far from major pollution sources whereas for rice agriculture the methane source and the largest source of acid rain coincide in more urban environments
6388056 one line of investigation wed like to confirm is that the sulphate component of acid rain may actually boost rice yields this might paradoxically have the effect of reducing a source of food for the methane producing microorganisms that live in the soil
6388057 acid rain is one of several pollution problems in asia that need solving but we need to appreciate the potential consequences of that clean up one of which could be an increase in methane emissions as the effect of the acid rain wears off
6388058 there are signs that physical demand is rising sharply in response to low prices
6388059 indian jewellers for example are paying far bigger premiums to gold importers in order to meet the rise in demand
6388060 indian demand should rise rapidly over the next few months especially with the countrys main religious holidays approaching which should provide an additional boost
6388061 oil prices at current levels could attract further investment fund flows into precious metals
6388062 ok ive got three obama topics today and i had three obama topics yesterday i cant do any more obama topics
6388063 it could be much more serious than all the flooding phenomena that we normally and naturally have in the valley that leads up to grindelwald
6388064 at the start we thought there could be a problem in ten years this year we have observed that once again things are accelerating now we know that we must act relatively quickly
6388065 when the lake empties it can really create a very very big flood that at the start goes to the end of the grindelwald plain and from there it spreads out
6388066 from there it could inundate all of the grindelwald plain and affect the train station after that it would go down the whole valley
6388067 it was very active and falling all the time there is a big risk everything could collapse we cannot say when as it is all degrading quickly from all sides and considering that the volume that fell is enormous

6388093 june is always an unusual month in the broadcast calendar because most programming is re runs and summer fare
6388094 however there are still a few big network program finales that dominate the ratings such as the 2 hour finale of lost which lead the top commercials for both total viewership and timeshifted viewership interestingly u s open final golf also placed high in total viewership but is nowhere to be found on the timeshifted viewership as the vast majority of viewing occurred live
6388095 what is particularly impressive is that every commercial in the top 10 for timeshifted viewing aired during the lost season finale in fact the top 86 commercials for timeshifted viewing aired during lost the rank order of the specific commercials continues to demonstrate the choices viewers are making about which commercials to watch the top 5 spots in timeshifted viewing were all for movies with the highest spot getting a 7 7 timeshifted rating the lowest spot from this lost episode got a 2 8 timeshifted rating approximately 64 lower than the audience of the highest rated spot

6388113 the delegation expressed their appreciation for the prime ministers efforts which led to solving the issue in a civilised manner and in a way that was in the best interests of all parties
6388114 political awareness and civilised way the local community used legal channels to express their opinion about the project
6388115 maximising the role of dialogue between the government and civil society
6388116 the government needed time to conduct negotiations so that it might take the right decision the issue was very complicated
6388117 caused development projects in the governorate to be stopped however they will be resumed after a short time
6388118 the supreme council of energys decision to cancel the e agrium project and mobcos acquisition of its shares did not fulfil the demands and ambitions of the people of damietta
6388119 the decision considered the economic side of the project while ignoring the environmental one
6388120 the site of the mobco plant is very close to residential areas in ras al barr and the pollution load will remain high the environmental effects will be very dangerous
6388121 confuse people by changing the name of e agrium to mobco
6388122 what should matter are the negative effects on the environment

6388127 whether or not they grant applicants a visa and that is a matter related to sovereignty our citizens have the right to be treated in a decent manner
6388128 one of the points we made is that there should be clear guidelines to employees whether they are egyptian or not on how they treat applicants they should help them clearly specifying the documents necessary for an application

6388130 christians and muslims live side by side in peace and harmony
6388131 i am optimistic but i must stress that this is not a land dispute the media downplayed the seriousness and the implications of the conflict it is partly a complex question of property taxes that concerns the minya governorate and the municipal authorities in question
6388132 the abu fana monastery was not defended the monks were at the mercy of the bedouin arab tribesmen some of whom act as police informants and undercover security agents in the past three years there have been 18 attacks on the monastery and the police have done absolutely nothing
6388133 tuesdays settlement was a step in the right direction we do not want the media and the judiciary to treat this as an issue involving muslims and christians we want it to be viewed as a criminal matter concerning outlaws and their innocent victims
6388134 how can this be when three monks were kidnapped and tortured in the desert by bedouins
6388135 the deposit structure will not change as even if the value of the dollar increases the difference between the interest rate on egyptian pounds denominated deposits and those on dollars is almost 10 per cent higher in favour of the former

6388142 the political beggar invites the us to interfere in egypts affairs and press for his release ayman nour reveals his secret relationship with the us the prisoner appeals to the incoming us administration after failing with bushs administration
6388143 what ayman nour did by writing such a stupid letter was nothing but begging and humiliation
6388144 the us has long been using ayman nour and similar cases as pressure cards to secure concessions from the regime
6388145 i dont think the next us administration will act better than bushs
6388146 its an article written in the form of an open letter and will be published in the washington post very soon
6388147 for all the occasional ups and downs no one can deny the historic nature of the ties between syria and lebanon the two countries share the same history and geography the two nations are bound together by mutual interests marriage and economic needs
6388148 in a manner commensurate with developments and the interests of both nations
6388149 how am i supposed to reason with people like this
6388150 the psychological scars resulting from this situation would be very difficult to heal there is a lot of vengeance and vindictiveness and israel is of course the ultimate beneficiary
6388151 it is becoming increasingly clear that the persistence of crisis is an integral part of the regional order especially the overall israeli palestinian scene israel will do all it can to maintain or at least prolong the conflict between the two palestinian camps
6388152 i still favour the two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are i think that the feeling is that there are two courses taking place that are opposed to one another on the one hand there is what people are saying and thinking on both sides there is the sense that we are running out of time that if we want a two state solution we need to implement it quickly but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other

6388169 trade in paper barrels has expanded dramatically in recent years many believe that the proper functioning of futures markets has been altered by the various loopholes that effectively allow unlimited and undetected speculation far beyond the limits of healthy liquidity providing levels towards damaging price distorting ones
6388170 opec has increased its crude supply by four million barrels per day mb d since 2003 with another one mb d increase from its natural gas liquids ngls
6388171 these investments are expected to result in a net capacity increase by 2012 of over five mb d from 2007 levels
6388172 despite the extreme high growth rates for some renewables the rather low initial base makes the growth in absolute terms rather limited
6388173 growth prospects are considered to be dependant upon imports of liquefied natural gas lng and the exploitation of unconventional sources to compensate for expected falls in the production of conventional gas
6388174 while gas demand in developing countries is expected to be considerably stronger than for other regions at over four per cent p a on average to 2030 this will be at a considerably lower rate than that witnessed over the past two decades
6388175 for example the current surge in us ethanol supplies is already impacting refining economics and capacity requirements biofuels are projected to continue to grow
6388176 there is a lengthy list of announced projects the question is how much of this announced capacity will be built and in turn come on stream
6388177 this terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful coexistence in the country
6388178 i think this is part of the rise of the new salafists in lebanon and it was timed as president suleiman visited damascus because they are very against the syrians
6388179 fatah main leaders disappeared from the battlefield the military has been targeted because they see it as their main enemy
6388180 we are seeing an attempt by the new salafists to break down the new relations between lebanon and syria in the interests of saudi arabia and its supporters
6388181 the situation has been unleashed and cannot be contained by the future movement
6388182 the text is not bad it speaks about forbidding bloodshed and not scorning the different schools of thought in islam but it is politicised because it was signed with a small group that it did not have a problem with in the first place
6388183 they have a problem with us and they did not approach us to make peace
6388184 this is partly an attempt to weaken future and saudi arabia on the part of qatar
6388185 we may soon see a showdown between the salafis themselves in the north
6388186 during school there is no extra time for fun only homework study and maybe one sport once or twice a week but when school is out the sun is shining and kids are bored the key is to keep them busy but remember having fun in egypt like anything else in the country has become expensive
6388187 i dont deny that some parents enrol their kids on sports courses as a replacement for a babysitter others want their children to become champions but the majority are like me i want my children to be fit and healthy and learn basic skills if i keep them at home in summer they end up watching tv and playing computer games all the time they can end up short sighted inactive and lacking skills in the summer i restrict them to an hour of television before bedtime and send them to educational camps in the morning
6388188 as children we used to play tennis at the club but that was 25 years ago now its a mafia
6388189 an old coach trains the kids at the club school for 15 minutes each and charges le80 for three days a week then there are private groups of four kids each player gets 20 minutes individual tuition for le140 per month then there are special groups outside clubs where the kid plays alone for half an hour for three days a week a month can cost up to le700 this summer i sent my 10 year old daughter and kept the six year old at home i cant afford to pay for both on top of language and music courses i want my kids to be fit to have friends and be able to play the way we used to play as children but the cost of it all is frustrating
6388190 i cant afford to wait for a lucky chance im doing everything i can to make sure i become the father of a famous footballer
6388191 people leave their kids most of the time at the club but they develop bad habits alone they eat unhealthy junk food go to the cinema are exposed to drugs and homosexual behaviour if parents want their kids to play sports they should try to be around clubs are not a safe environment because many coaches care more about making money than the children in their charge
6388192 i love swimming though sometimes i get tired but i am not allowed to miss a day what i do sometimes in summer that i cant do during school time is go to the cinema with my friends and eat out but not for more than two and half hours maximum i cant play soccer because i will feel worn out
6388193 we start with ten minutes fitness then take a five minutes break then get half an hour on tennis skills though there are five in the group so we barely get five minutes each
6388194 because of numbers the court is divided into two of three we cant play freely and we learn the basic skills of the game wrong when dad complained about it the coach suggested giving us private lessons if dad didnt complain we would have paid money to learn nothing except greed and not doing a job properly thats what i learned from my first experience of sports this summer
6388195 i know im not privileged i come alone without my family i dont have good shoes or an expensive strip i dont have anyone to back me but i know i have talent so i wont lose hope
6388196 but when i see other kids with training suits and rich parents i think that life is not fair
6388197 the amount parents pay for private training exceeds the le7 billion they fork out on private lessons
6388198 there is a huge amount of waste of money effort human resources and talent there are families that want their kids to win because the parents did not parents and coaches should help children select sports that are best suited to their physical abilities but they are ignorant
6388199 there are too many competitions for children endurance appears just before maturity and if children are pressured earlier they will never be champions and 90 per cent of coaches are untrained or unprofessional parents coaches schools and sports bodies are not doing their job and failing the kids we see clubs crammed with children who do more than one sport but we dont have champions
6388200 kids may not seem to have worries but even the luckiest do
6388201 they may not have adult concerns but they want to be accepted by their peers please their teachers and coaches and not upset their parents however they face disappointments and frustrations while trying to prove themselves on the sport field and as they learn and grow and deal with disappointments new worries emerge we should develop their mental and physical well being as well as their skills rather than pressing them hard stripping them of their childhood denying them fun and taking the sportsmanship from sport

6388256 in our own sweet way without wasting taxpayers money im convinced we can do just as well in 2012
6388257 there is a big issue about how you move athletes around
6388258 had it been us staging the games i dont think we would necessarily have done the switcheroo with the girl with the braces
6388259 the police investigation at this stage is focusing on the coach itself rather than the road where the crash happened examination of the coach is ongoing and officers are
6388260 although our inquiries have concluded at the scene local officers will maintain a highly visible presence in the village over the next few days
6388261 id like to re iterate my thanks to local residents for their support and assistance this week i also want to express my thanks to alton towers staff who offered shelter and first aid to dozens of the traumatized passengers and arranged transport home for them their help to the emergency services on monday night was invaluable
6388262 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
6388263 the vehicle company will be also in charge of the maintenance of the vehicles and will pay the sca a monthly fee to operate them
6388264 a stable for horses and camels will also be created outside the archaeological site at the entrance gate located on the cairo fayoum road as their current location is an eyesore and contributes to the loss of the sacred atmosphere of the plateau
6388265 camels and horses should not be ridden within the pyramid area but should be kept to the proposed
6388266 they had to regain their confidence to forget the misri defeat and look forward to ahlis upcoming matches especially that all of us target the african title the win has also moved us closer to securing a place in the semi finals
6388267 supporters should be more patient so that we can help the team find its best shape i have been here since two months only
6388268 i dont think we should blame players because i believe they have done their best in the game asec made it difficult for us after the red card they defended extensively we should never give up on reaching the semi finals we know our remaining games are not easy but we can still go through
6388269 businessmen will pick up the challenge of renovating the 200 year old building
6388270 arson is a safe way in egypt for corrupt officials to get rid of important documents and files and in the case of the parliamentary fire these could be documents related to the sinking of the red sea ferry
6388271 it is ludicrous to allege that the fire was caused intentionally to destroy documents about the lost ferry the fire erupted in the shura council which had nothing to do with the ferry the assemblys own report into the disaster was very critical of the government and included all the relevant documents
6388272 there is a general sense of schadenfreude and anger towards the regime and a feeling that officials deserve what happened
6388273 musharrafs party performed poorly at the february elections he should have resigned then and there his party was thoroughly defeated at the polls
6388274 instead he tried to compromise with the new ruling clique that was not a very wise decision because he was already in an embarrassingly compromising position
6388275 the new ruling clique was unwilling to accommodate him even more importantly he discovered that the armed forces were not going to support him practically everyone deserted him he then belatedly realised that it was not going to work he had to step down still he waited until the government urged impeachment that was the last straw
6388276 washington is notorious for ditching its trusted allies when it no longer has any use for them or when they prove to be a liability
6388277 todays report shows that the nhs is getting better and better at identifying people with diabetes and at supporting them to manage their condition
6388278 the next stage review made prevention a priority for the nhs and this is especially relevant to diabetes as a disease whose global increase in prevalence is partly a consequence of rising obesity
6388279 our vascular risk assessment programme putting prevention first is expected to prevent thousands of people developing diabetes each year and our strategy to tackle the rise in obesity will help many more reduce their risk of the disease
6388280 the nhs has responded impressively to the first five years of the national service framework more and more people with diabetes are getting good routine care and their outcomes are improving year on year
6388281 the next five years will continue to bring challenges for diabetes teams as they work to further improve diabetes services in both primary and secondary care
6388282 i look forward to working with the national diabetes support team and other key partners such as diabetes uk to support the nhs in driving further improvements in care for people with diabetes
6388283 the illegal purchase of alcohol by young people is a significant problem in the uk
6388284 if the scottish government wants to tackle scotlands drinking problem it needs a comprehensive strategy that is fully resourced and followed through we need to let retailers and the drinks industry know we mean business selling to alcohol to under 18s and irresponsible alcohol promotion will not be ignored in scotland any longer
6388285 our work at the centre has long been confirming that the technology really can predict and reduce injury but now it has formed part of one of the largest randomized orthotic studies in the world
6388286 on a daily basis we see athletes members of the military and recreational sportsmen and women whose lives can be dramatically improved as a result of this kind of facility
6388287 we are delighted that now we can confidently share our success with the wider world on the basis of these exciting findings
6388288 the d3d performance orthotic is proving to be very successful in the treatment and management of many of the prevalent lower limb injuries seen in military recruit training
6388289 this research is a massive step forward and potentially means a saving of many thousands of pounds for the military
6388290 it typically costs 2000 per week to have a person out of training through injury we needed proof that the right technology could help us predict and prevent that and we now seem to have that evidence
6388291 theyre all seriously worried that its georgia today and one of them tomorrow
6388292 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
6388293 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
6388294 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said
6388295 my emotions were so up and down right now i think im mostly in shock i really dont have to words to describe everything involved here mostly i guess im very proud im so proud of travis and im so proud of port alberni
6388296 i dont know that something like this has ever happened with a community in canada before wrestling is a big part of the community it has a long history travis is the first olympian but it goes back its like a lot of small towns in canada everybody knows everybody they made this really special
6388297 it started in 1992 when travis was 12 years old i was his school principal he was a pretty good little hockey player but i suggested wrestling might be his forte later that year he watched jeff thue wrestle for canada in barcelona and told his mom he was going to make it to the olympics sixteen years later here we all are
6388298 he came back one day and told me he just couldnt go on i asked him if the dream was still alive he said yes so i told him well make it happen
6388299 i know after all of this travis is going to spend a lot of time giving back to the community
6388300 i could hear them all i knew the whole town would be watching
6388301 i know it was a pretty excruciating experience i put them through i had the opportunity to close out each one
6388302 i hope they all understand they made a small town in canada special and i hope other small towns in canada are inspired by this story
6388303 apart from the length the lack of new weapons is also disappointing
6388304 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
6388305 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
6388306 enge kooperation zwischen den bayerischen sicherheitsbeh rden dem dfb dem bayerischen fu ballverband und den vereinen
6388307 mit dem sicherheitskonzept fu ball haben wir sehr gute erfahrungen gemacht wir passen es jetzt an die neue struktur mit 3 profi liga und neuer regionalliga an die vertrauensvolle zusammenarbeit mit dem dfb dem bayerischen fu ballverband den sicherheitsbeauftragten der vereine und der intensive landes und bundesweite informationsaustausch sichern uns fr hzeitig erkenntnisse um gegen randalierer einzugreifen rowdies und hooligans sind keine fu ballfans und haben mit fu ball nichts zu tun wir wollen dass f r die b rger die familien der sport im mittelpunkt steht und sie nicht bef rchten m ssen opfer von gewalt zu werden
6388308 derartige eskalationen wollen wir mit einem schnellen und umfangreichen wissens und informationsaustausch ber die l ndergrenzen hinweg so weit wie m glich verhindern
6388309 damit r cken wir noch n her an gewaltbereite problemgruppen heran und k nnen ber pr ventivpolizeiliche ma nahmen wie gef hrderansprachen meldeauflagen und aufenthaltsbeschr nkungen bis hin zum unterbindungsgewahrsam gezielt auf diese personen einwirken
6388310 wir werden auch weiterhin konsequent gegen fu ballrandalierer vorgehen um der gro en mehrheit der zuschauer die fu ball als vergn gen und zerstreuung ansehen einen spannenden gewaltfreien und ungest rten nachmittag in unseren stadien zu erm glichen
6388311 wir haben damit sehr gute voraussetzungen f r die sicherheit rund um das fu ballvergn gen in bayern
6388312 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6388313 em uma primeira tentativa o piloto saiu voltou porque detectou algo este algo tem que ser dito pela comiss o de investiga o
6388314 o pessoal da manuten o da pr pria empresa autorizou a partida do avi o assumindo a responsabilidade que tem exatamente ao fazer uma revis o quando o comandante adverte para qualquer tipo de incid ncia na aeronave
6388315 n o me atreveria a dizer que a spanair se descuida na seguran a de seus avi es nem muito menos
6388316 ser o principalmente as caixas pretas que nos permitir o identificar quais foram as causas
6388317 a aeronave subiu 200 p s pouco mais de 50 metros e caiu
6388318 a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states a clear violation of international law
6388319 immediately and unconditionally cease operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
6388320 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation georgias territorial integrity must be respected
6388321 is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
6388322 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip with a very aggressive belligerent statement
6388323 temperature of your rhetoric isnt a measure of your commitment to georgian sovereignty
6388324 in line with the moral clarity and american exceptionalism projected by president george w bushs first term
6388325 why should we send an ambassador there what will he do there they are killing one another in iraq today there is only killing
6388326 it seems that the americans are going to leave and what does that mean more killing so why send egyptians there we should get the egyptians who are there back and not leave them to be killed
6388327 egypt will only send an ambassador there when we are very confident about the security of the embassy or when we can have the ambassador stationed in the green zone which is supposedly the most secured part of baghdad even if it is still subject to assaults
6388328 egypt is not willing to risk the lives of its diplomats
6388329 the situation is not an easy one because even if we send the ambassador to the green zone and then the americans started to pull out early next year we would have a big problem because this would be the most targeted spot in all of baghdad
6388330 but we have to think of what would happen if we have another ihab el sherif the public was very angry at the time
6388331 see eye to eye on the need to keep all options on the table though we may not agree on each and every detail its important the americans understand our position and i think that they understand it a lot better after this visit
6388332 the more we train together and exchange ideas the readier well be in any future scenario that may require joint or coalition operations
6388333 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia
6388334 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything
6388335 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
6388336 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
6388337 the union of the three slavic republics russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan
6388338 but even he did not manage to make ukraine a gift of sevastopol which remained a separate city under the jurisdiction of the ussr central government
6388339 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6388340 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardising russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
6388341 mamas dont let your cowboys grow up to be babies
6388342 clearly demonstrate that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behavior
6388343 college student experience of mental health service use and psychiatric medication
6388344 university mental health providers have observed increased numbers of students visiting college mental health centers
6388345 were at a time when students are being diagnosed at a younger age with mental illnesses
6388346 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination
6388347 the magnitude of the obesity epidemic adds a staggering burden to our current health care system these studies point to the serious potential risks of gi disease for individuals who are overweight or obese
6388348 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
6388349 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
6388350 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
6388351 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases
6388352 there has been a lot of doubt within the international community that there are health outcomes of health tests and patient centred consultations within primary care
6388353 in denmark general practitioners are gate keepers to the entire health system almost all danes are ascribed to specific general practitioners such findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should now consider implementing health tests and consultations more widely
6388354 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6388355 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6388356 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6388357 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
6388358 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6388359 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
6388360 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
6388361 managing diabetes is challenging for children and young people and despite parental support and expert education many struggle to control their diabetes
6388362 it is thought that combining educational and psychological approaches may help young people to gain the confidence and motivation they need to manage their diabetes effectively but this is yet to be investigated properly we hope that our research will help to inform the future development of services for young people with diabetes
6388363 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6388364 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6388365 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6388366 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6388367 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6388368 getting hold of the right patients for periodic reviews at the right time is often cumbersome the system makes it a lot easier
6388369 anyone opposing the nationalisation of iranian oil is an enemy of islam
6388370 at least 40 people have been killed and 100 more are injured
6388371 fifas position will at least be that we will go with under 23 but we shall put in in the international calendar to avoid any problems with the release of players
6388372 we will take decisions to better protect the olympic tournament
6388373 these things cannot be taken care of in one motion as if with a magic wand
6388374 we knew that we could not deploy f 15 fighter jets because it was not possible to differentiate between french troops and taliban fighters
6388375 if bombs would have been dropped then there would have been serious collateral damage
6388376 we are now eight months into these negotiations and while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6388377 negotiators in accra can break the deadlock between developed and developing countries
6388378 ultimately all nations need to tackle climate change together and in accra the rich countries can live up to their full potential ideally led by an eu that teams up with the emerging economies
6388379 capsaicin is classified as a doping prohibited substance given its hypersensitizing properties and as a medication class a prohibited substance for its pain relieving properties
6388380 confirmatory analysis of the b samples will be carried out very shortly according to the accelerated procedure in place for the olympic games
6388381 upon report of a positive b sample result evidence and written submissions will be requested from the rider and a three member panel of the fei tribunal will be appointed
6388382 this panel should take a decision as to the applicable sanctions as early as possible further to the accelerated procedure and providing for a hearing to be held as necessary
6388383 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and pick up good points
6388384 so much as i want to win in valencia i know the most important thing is to score well because the big picture is the championship and not just once race
6388385 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6388386 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race
6388387 its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
6388388 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers

6388410 jerkiness is related to narcissism a jerk usually has a long history of failed relationships and theyll always tell you why it was the other persons fault the relationship gets really serious really fast they get infatuated but the second the jerk finds out that youre not perfect and you no longer see them as perfect they become demanding and critical
6388411 jerks have no gender the only difference is the package they come in
6388412 just sit back relax and wait for the traffic to start pouring into your website
6388413 things are a bit crazy now in china its a bit of madhouse the rhythm of the city has got faster every six months things are changed and the last year with the build up to the olympics it has been even more
6388414 really you can do whatever you want theres more freedom now than 10 years ago
6388415 for a musician you just have to sing about what you want and pretend that the boundaries dont exist
6388416 its just normal for bands today consumerism and a commercial world is what theyre used to
6388417 it was a chance to tour and connect with other bands thats the kind of diy ethos we like
6388418 abbiamo iniziato male e siamo stati troppo prudenti commenta lex tecnico del real madrid cf nel primo tempo la danimarca stata superiore ma abbiamo reagito bene disputando una buona partita contro una squadra di alto livello
6388419 se non fosse stato per gli interventi di puyol e casillas avremmo subito almeno una rete ma grazie alla sicurezza e alle doti dei ragazzi siamo riusciti a ribaltare lincontro ci aspettano due partite di qualificazione alla coppa del mondo fifa e dobbiamo correggere alcuni aspetti siamo favoriti e non possiamo sbagliare soprattutto in casa
6388420 questo modulo ha funzionato bene agli europei spiega con la squadra che abbiamo dobbiamo giocare come sappiamo contro la danimarca ha funzionato specialmente nel secondo tempo
6388421 ci sono molti giovani e non siamo ancora al massimo delle potenzialit dobbiamo proseguire sulla scia di uefa euro 2008 e con del bosque penso che ci riusciremo

6388427 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6388428 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6388429 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6388430 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6388431 we are keen to hear from anyone who can help us trace those responsible for the most recent spate of vandalism
6388432 these highly irresponsible incidents cause the car owners a significant amount of money to repair
6388433 we would appeal for anyone who can help us find the people responsible
6388434 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6388435 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6388436 he returned home and when he saw one of the neighbours making a rude hand gesture he described how he simply flipped
6388437 he does have outstanding anger management issues and his partner asked him not to come back to the house until these issues are dealt with
6388438 with regard to his record it has reduced dramatically since 2003
6388439 it was after his 30th birthday that he met his partner his offending stopped and he has now found himself in steady employment
6388440 to say you have an appalling record is almost an understatement
6388441 your rate of offending has reduced however there is another breach of the peace conviction very recently involving the same neighbours
6388442 in the hard uncompromising wrestle you have defeated your rivals and confidently added a new chapter to the national big time sport history
6388443 the best wrestlers qualities have helped you to climb the olympic summit courage excellent techniques and the enormous will to win and certainly the talent of the trainers support of the team mates and a million of fans that believed in your mastery
6388444 is a bright confirmation of your unequalled mastery perseverance and enormous purposefulness
6388445 it has become a real gift to the numerous fans of track and field athletics
6388446 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6388447 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6388448 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6388449 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6388450 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6388451 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6388452 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6388453 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6388454 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6388455 i am very happy firstly for the result against morton as it is very important to win away but im also delighted with the performance
6388456 i can see the benefits of our training on the pitch in every game
6388457 it has been great and a very big surprise for me these players are fantastic as in just a month and half they have learned so much
6388458 i have worked in many countries in europe but this is the first time i have seen players pick up our methods and learn so much in such a short space of time
6388459 after saturdays match i received a wonderful compliment from the morton chairman
6388460 he said to me that in 24 years no team had come to his ground and played as much football as we did last week
6388461 all the players now know their role in the team and on the pitch our defensive line is solid and its going well
6388462 id like to praise all of our players from the experienced ones to the youngsters
6388463 personally i am sure that if we continue to train with the same passion as we have we will see the results
6388464 i dont know if we will win the league or not but we will definitely be playing to win something
6388465 we had a small problem with pierre martini and jean cuenca before the morton game but martini was able to play
6388466 we have been careful not to rush cuenca and he has missed some training this week but he should be okay for clyde this weekend
6388467 and in goal we have now signed roddy mckenzie on a two year deal as well and he is a good addition
6388468 alejandro caiaffa is still struggling with an achilles injury but alfonso nano could play after his clearance from the italian fc arrived this week
6388469 fernando cant play at the moment as we are waiting for clearance from the argentine fa

6388472 it is the councils responsibility to enforce planning conditions but they failed in this case
6388473 these people are paid from the public purse and have an obligation to look at the concerns of the public
6388474 they didnt do their duty to the public here and we have suffered as a result
6388475 i suggest that it would bring this long running matter to an end if alex linkston as the present chief executive of west lothian council apologised to the families who had to live in an unacceptable environment because of pollution
6388476 this pollution could have been avoided if the planning conditions had been properly adhered to by the brickworks owners and properly enforced by the council when non compliance was brought to their attention
6388477 we received a letter from local mp michael connarty on july 31 which we acknowledged the following day
6388478 we are preparing a response to the points raised by him
6388479 you wilson show very little insight into the nature and consequences of your conduct nor have you shown remorse
6388480 indeed at one stage after many years of abuse by you one of your victims summoned up the courage to tell someone about what happened
6388481 you then successfully branded her as a liar and claimed she was suffering from a psychiatric condition
6388482 they found that the accused had been actively searching for viewing and downloading images of bestiality
6388483 they also found that he had downloaded 140 indecent images and video files of children and had actively been sharing this type of material
6388484 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6388485 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6388486 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6388487 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity
6388488 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work shah said

6388490 there is nothing left for the yankees to prove in 2008 theyve established themselves as one of the weaker sisters in club history
6388491 this figures to get a lot worse before it gets better
6388492 some people maybe dont want to take a gamble on me with my past
6388493 thankfully brian gave me a call im trying to help this team make the playoffs
6388494 while rodriguez has won a record 13 gold gloves as a catcher he seems to have had trouble getting in synch with the yankees pitchers mike mussina and andy pettitte have continued to pitch to molina pettitte worked with rodriguez once before that was abandoned and with rodriguez catching yankees pitchers have a 6 21 era the yankees have gone 3 7 in rodriguezs starts
6388495 its hard to decide whats more amusing that irabu had 20 mugs of beer or that the bar allowed to him to get out another credit card and pay his tab after he beat up the bartender meanwhile kei igawa spent a peaceful night at his apartment in scranton watching tora tora tora
6388496 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6388497 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6388498 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6388499 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6388500 its been going well and i managed to get myself into the squad for the first game of the season at the weekend
6388501 it was a good experience but one which was totally different
6388502 even driving into the stadiums like the emirates is totally different to what ive been used to in scotland
6388503 watching the game against arsenal on the bench was amazing but youve got to blur out of your mind how good the players are in case you get the chance to come on and play
6388504 i played my first games on the tour of germany and that was excellent
6388505 to be playing against teams of higher quality is only going to help me
6388506 i feel like i have improved in the months since i left scotland and i feel im improving and learning every day
6388507 every footballer strives to be a better player and id like to think im getting better
6388508 peter grant has come in and along with craig beattie its good to have a few scottish boys in the club
6388509 they have spoken to me every day and have been great with me as has the manager
6388510 im still looking out for livingstons results and i see sparky has been scoring a lot of goals
6388511 im delighted for him and its good to see them have a good start
6388512 they have some top players like james mcpake gary miller and dave mackay and i want to see them do well
6388513 they deserve it and those players deserve a chance in the spl
6388514 i have not managed to go up and see them yet this season but i hope i will later
6388515 but two league wins in three games and a challenge cup quarter final is a decent start for them
6388516 ive not spoken to snoddy for a month or so but i watched him playing for leeds in the live game on sky and he did very well
6388517 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6388518 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6388519 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6388520 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6388521 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6388522 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6388523 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6388524 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6388525 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6388526 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6388527 it is always disappointing to hear about job losses in west lothian
6388528 we understand that livingston will be affected by hbos plans to cut around 400 jobs in the uk
6388529 we have not yet received notification of local redundancies we will be seeking a meeting with hbos to discuss their plans and to see what assistance support and advice we can offer to local employees
6388530 i have written to andy hornby the chief executive officer of hbos to request a meeting to discuss forthcoming staff losses in livingston
6388531 hbos have not yet announced how many jobs will be affected in livingston
6388532 i am deeply concerned by this recent announcement and the impact it will have on local families
6388533 i have asked for this meeting not only to end speculation about cuts and identify how many local workers will be affected but also to ascertain how local redundancies will be managed
6388534 i will support constituents in any way i can and will endeavour to ensure that livingston employees receive all the support and advice they deserve
6388535 it was announced last week that 325 posts will go across the company but we are not splitting that figure into individual areas
6388536 it was important for us to find a sponsor who is very involved in the local community we appreciate rdfs backing at a time when livingston fc is looking to connect again with local people and local businesses
6388537 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6388538 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6388539 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6388540 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6388541 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6388542 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6388543 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6388545 there remains a risk that the regions economy will contract in the third quarter
6388546 retail sales figures will get worse later in the year
6388547 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6388548 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6388549 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6388550 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6388555 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6388556 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6388557 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6388558 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6388559 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6388560 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6388561 wir freuen uns auf die gelegenheit jetzt unser publikum in intimer atmosph re unterhalten zu k nnen das wird f r alle sehr spannend und dem publikum im club garantiert einen riesenspa machen

6388592 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6388593 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6388594 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6388595 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6388596 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6388597 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6388598 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6388599 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6388600 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6388601 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6388602 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6388603 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6388604 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6388605 who are open to doing something on the production side
6388606 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6388607 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6388608 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6388609 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6388610 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6388611 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6388612 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6388613 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6388614 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real

6388621 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6388622 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6388623 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6388624 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6388625 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6388626 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6388627 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6388628 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6388629 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6388630 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6388631 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6388632 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6388633 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6388634 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6388635 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6388636 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6388637 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6388638 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6388639 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6388640 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6388641 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6388642 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6388643 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6388644 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6388645 we warn the enemy against continuing its policy if it continues with the insistence approach shalit will be considered a second ron arad
6388646 abbas and fayyad are not interested in seeing the palestinian resistance achieve an honorable deal as they do not believe in the way of the resistance they only believe in the road of negotiations and in pleading with the enemy and manage to release prisoners whose jail term was close to its end like in the recent list

6388679 it is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6388680 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6388681 obviously everybody is going to keep an eye on conditions on the ground

6388689 if senator obama is truly going to bring transparency to washington this is surely no way to do it
6388690 and maybe this is a playing out of his negotiating with dictators and people like that without preconditions
6388691 to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere

6388696 am 20 mai bat ich beamte des direktoriums der federal reserve zu mir um mit ihnen ber unsere gef hrdete wirtschaft zu sprechen sie lie en durchblicken dass ich jedenfalls was die vereinigten staaten anginge gespenster s he und erkl rten dass nichts vor sich gehe womit sie und ihre banken nicht leicht fertig werden w rden
6388697 am 16 juni fragte ich beamte der federal reserve in welcher h he amerikanische banken und firmen solche wechsel in h nden hielten nach berpr fung der angelegenheit teilten sie mir mit da unsere banken nur 400 000 000 bis 500 000 000 von ihnen bes en und da sie leicht erledigt werden k nnten
6388698 irgendwie f hlte ich mich durch diesen bericht nicht zufriedengestellt und am morgen wies ich das w hrungsaufsichtsamt an mir einen genauen bericht ber solche amerikanische posten direkt von den banken einzuholen vierundzwanzig stunden sp ter erhielt ich die erschreckende nachricht da die gesamten amerikanischen bankanlagen in solchen papieren wahrscheinlich 1 700 000 000 berstiegen da gewisse banken die ber 1 000 000 000 an einlagen bes en solche wechsel in einem umfang aufgenommen h tten der im falle eines verlustes ihr kapital oder ihre reserven angreifen und dadurch gro e bef rchtungen in der ffentlichkeit wecken w rde
6388699 was noch schlimmer war der beamte des w hrungsaufsichtsamtes teilte mir mit da diese europ ischen banken bereits bei vielen bankakzepten in verzug geraten seien und sich fieberhaft bem hten eine prolongierung zu erreichen
6388700 einen oder zwei tage sp ter antworteten sie h chst beunruhigt da in den banken gro britanniens und der dominions schwedens norwegens der schweiz hollands und d nemarks 2 000 000 000 davon liegen k nnten
6388701 es sah zu diesem zeitpunkt daher so aus als ob deutschland sterreich ungarn und die anderen osteurop ischen l nder bis zu 5 000 000 000 solcher kurzfristiger wechsel im umlauf h tten
6388702 aber die finanzbombe in europa war weitaus gr er als unsere sch tzungen vermuten lie en nun kann man heute aber absch tzen da sich der gesamtumfang kurzfristiger internationaler privater verschuldung zu beginn des jahres 1931 auf mehr als 10 000 000 000 belief
6388703 wir haben einige zeit aufgewendet um die finanziellen auswirkungen des subprime problems zu bewerten

6388751 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6388752 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6388758 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
6388759 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
6388760 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
6388761 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
6388762 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit

6388768 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6389456 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god

6389515 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6389516 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6389517 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something

6389520 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6389521 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6389522 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6389523 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6389524 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6389525 due to its oral activity and plausible long term durable response rate seen in ra patients in the initial multi center placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial oral dnajp1 may have an important clinical advantage over current injectable ra treatments which have significant toxicities our preliminary studies also strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of dnajp1 is complementary to current biologics thus providing the opportunity to develop combination therapies which may improve currently used regimens the long term statistically significant improvement in clinical scores as seen by acr20 and acr50 following cessation of drug therapy further suggests that this technology may be inducing a tolerogenic response
6389526 we are pleased to have broadened our therapeutic pipeline of products with the acquisition of this innovative program oral dnajp1 certainly complements our existing clinical stage immunology programs which include trimesta our oral phase ii iii clinical program in multiple sclerosis and our cd4 inhibitor technology we have been equally impressed with the rigor and quality of the scientific data along with the level of grant funding this program has received over the years from the nih we look forward to reporting additional clinical data from this study later this year

6389529 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
6389530 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
6389531 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
6389532 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
6389533 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r

6389535 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
6389536 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
6389537 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
6389538 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
6389539 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
6389540 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
6389541 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
6389542 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
6389543 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
6389544 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran

6389565 islam has declared world war iii against everything non muslim
6389566 when will the liberal media wake up to see that islam has declared a world war against everyting non muslim may allah be damned to the hell muslims wish to create on earth
6389567 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
6389568 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
6389569 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up
6389570 arabs lie islam preaches lying to infidels fingerprints dont lie boo hoo time to demand ids to check into hotels and passport registration for all foreign nationalists who want hotel rooms also id checks and passport registrations for anyone renting an apartment

6389574 the only thing the islamic world understands is force lets destroy a few of these hate schools and start targeting these mad preachers of hate
6389575 lets see who is it not politically correct to profile

6389580 muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
6389581 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
6389582 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
6389583 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
6389584 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

6389587 a person who upon the attainment of the age of twenty one years is a citizen of kenya and also a citizen of some other country other than kenya shall subject to subsection 7 cease to be a citizen of kenya upon the specified date unless he has renounced his citizenship of that other country taken the oath of allegiance and in the case of a person who was born outside kenya made and registered such declaration of his intentions concerning residence as may be prescribed by or under an act of parliament

6389605 thanks to the efforts of all staff and continuous development of our services we have experienced a great deal of success in the id verification sector with our smart id plus anti money laundering service performing strongly in legal and financial markets we have also secured significant unclaimed assets contracts which have proved fruitful not only in monetary value but also from a promotional perspective as we have received a high volume of exposure in the national press and online whilst we look set to smash last years growth we are already firmly focusing on the forthcoming financial year with the intention of setting another record
6389606 myself and my team have worked hard over the last year to improve and build upon our service offering we have also further developed our internal systems for ease of use and to improve efficiency together these changes have allowed us to stay ahead of our competitors by offering superior service delivery to our customers
6389607 we are happy with our progress and we are excited about the growth during a cooler economy and during an election year i expect to continue to see increased growth over the coming months and years as more boomers and investors get closer to retirement look to truly diversify and shift a portion of their funds out of the market and into the local real estate market
6389608 we saw in 1980 that whenever threats are used as political leverage when discussing a boycott of the olympics the only real victims are the athletes
6389609 thankfully talk of a boycott did not lead to one at the 2008 olympic games the stories of heartache and disappointment chronicled in boycott prove that whenever politics and the olympics intersect seldom does it prove to be a good mix
6389610 boycott uniquely and poignantly captures the impact of american athletes denied the opportunity to compete in the olympic games nearly three decades later i continue to appreciate and understand their heartbreak and anger thanks to the authors we are reminded of their brave but painful sacrifice this book then becomes their belated but deserved olympic salute
6389611 the story of the u s boycott of the 1980 summer olympic games is best told through the eyes of the young athletes whose dreams were dashed by the decision their compelling tales are told here this was a time in u s history that should be remembered this is a book that should be read
6389612 the boycott of 1980 was a stunning experience because i thought in our country the individuals had the right to make their choices in sport it is reassuring that the caracciolis decided to tackle this story about america and american athletes in a challenging time

6389705 the important thing to watch is what happens in the polls after the conventions
6389706 because they have a lot to do with what happens in the polls after the conventions and that in turn could affect what happens at the polls in november
6389707 for instance this year barack obama looks like hes ahead on average by two or three percentage points but if you think about the kind of year this is very low levels of presidential approval high levels of dissatisfaction with the direction of the country you would expect him to be doing better than that so in this case the convention should provide a sort of corrective if it follows the predictable pattern it should give him a pretty substantial bump and bring him more in line with where his poll standing should be if the election were to turn out about the way one might expect it to

6389719 it makes no difference what the motivation its a very serious matter
6389720 the basic message was that people coming to this country should adapt
6389721 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this country and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
6389722 clearly this is offensive behavior on behalf of a public official
6389723 thank you for standing up for our way of life
6389724 its about time someone had the you know what to speak up
6389725 if we were unhappy with his behavior before this is even worse
6389726 he cant keep hiding behind somebody elses name and passing out material that is hateful to support his perspective
6389727 its unfortunate that hes been so stubborn in not apologizing

6389737 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6389738 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6389739 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6389740 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it the brisbane lawyer said
6389741 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6389742 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves he said

6389784 by joining a club i acquire leadership communication and organizational skills and learn to work with some difficult people these are all lessons i cant get in the classroom
6389785 the science is unequivocal now its urgent that we reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions
6389786 theres no purely technical solution to the climate challenge we have to change the way we think about our personal energy choices
6389787 is that you dont need to know any math to understand that the level of water in a tub rises as long as you pour water in faster than it drains out once people understand that were pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere far faster than they are removed they are better equipped to understand why we cant wait and see why we have to reduce ghg emissions today to protect the world we will pass on to our children

6389794 we are headed into a time when a confluence of changes are going to lead to a perfect storm making us finally realize that our health care system needs a major overhaul
6389795 as the elderly population doubles between now and about 2030 projections are that we will see at least a doubling of the costs of the federal and state health and retirement programs
6389796 that will likely be when the perfect storm hits but if we miss it then we will likely have missed all the storm clouds for the foreseeable future
6389797 while attention focuses on these two major trends other storm clouds are brewing
6389798 a long term care crisis looms grows and receives little attention despite problems with the affordability quality and access to long term care these problems will only become much worse as the aging population doubles by 2030
6389799 much attention also has been paid to the problems of financing social security but the financial problems of the social security program pale in comparison to the burden of the medicare and medicaid programs on our economy
6389800 there are already shortages of nurses and open nursing positions are sometimes filled by the expensive practice of recruiting migrant nurses into communities
6389801 added to this problem now are reports of shortages of other health professionals including therapists social workers health aides and even some categories of physicians
6389802 overall we continue to worry about the general quality of health care as well as the problems of health disparities as the inequities of our economy and culture flow into the health care system

6389804 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6389805 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6389806 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6389807 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6389808 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6389809 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
