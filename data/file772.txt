7720006 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7720007 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7720008 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7720009 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7720010 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7720011 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7720012 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7720013 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7720014 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7720015 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7720016 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7720017 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7720018 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7720019 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process
7720020 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries

7720028 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7720029 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7720030 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7720031 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7720032 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7720033 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7720034 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7720035 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
7720036 its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7720037 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities
7720038 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7720039 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves

7720099 hoe konden de duitsers miljoenen joden op een dergelijke gevoelloze en systematische manier vermoorden
7720100 wat was daar aan de hand waardoor zulke afgrijselijke onmenselijke praktijken mogelijk waren
7720101 het concept van martelen zal ook kunnen veranderen door de producten in deze markt het is mogelijk dat er binnenkort een technologie ontwikkeld zal zijn om informatie uit gevangenen te verkrijgen zonder dat de ondervraagde daar blijvend letsel aan overhoudt
7720102 experimenten tonen aan dat het voordeel van dergelijke apparatuur is dat menselijke bestuurders bevoordeeld zijn met foto herkenning en dergelijke
7720103 zeer grote en mogelijk zelfs katastrofische inlichtings fouten in de komende jaren
7720104 in de inlichtingendienst gemeenschap is er maar een klein aantal mensen dat de wetenschap begrijpt en zonder die mensen is het onmogelijk om verassingen te voorspellen dit is een zwart gat dat zo snel mogelijk gedicht dient te worden met licht
7720105 we zullen nog geen gedachten kunnen lezen op grote afstand maar dat betekend niet dat we niet angsten of grove gevoelens kunnen scannen en vervolgens de gedetecteerde personen van nabij te controleren of te ondervragen om te bekijken wat er met hem of haar aan de hand is
7720106 we wegen iemands betrouwbaarheid af aan de gaven die hij heeft ontvangen zijn charisma de omvang van zijn bediening of zijn gemeente of hij kan profeteren of niet of er wonderen door middel van hem gebeuren etc daarmee zijn wij leiders van de kerk net zo geworden als de wereld om ons heen in onze manieren van meten van succes dat heeft ertoe geleid dat het lichaam van christus miljoenen dollars geeft aan mensen die het niet verdienen we hebben het toegestaan dat mensen die in zonde leven invloedrijke leiders zijn geworden deie hun invloed zelfs tot in het witte huis kunnen doen gelden door ons gebrek aan onderscheidingsvermogen hebben wij een podium voor ze gebouwd hebben wij ze een stem gegeven
7720107 broeders zelfs indien iemand op een overtreding betrapt wordt helpt gij die geestelijk zijt hem terecht in een geest van zachtmoedigheid ziende op uzelf gij mocht ook eens in verzoeking komen verdraagt elkanders moeilijkheden z zult gij de wet van christus vervullen want indien iemand zich verbeeldt dat hij iets is en het niet is dan vergist hij zich zeer ieder moet zijn eigen werk toetsen dan zal hij slechts voor zichzelf stof tot roem hebben en niet voor een ander want ieder zal zijn eigen last dragen
7720108 when tragedy strikes someone we love our hearts swell and the urge to take action is almost relentless
7720109 you have all this diskspace but dont you dare try to use it
7720110 thanks for my dogs god they are my friends i really love them especially cali
7720111 god can choose to speak to us out loud but most of the time he talks to our hearts do you hear him telling you anything in here i patted her chest
7720112 jesus said let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for
7720113 please take these instructions to heart and abide by them
7720114 she was deliberately very forcefully thrown out by a very strong man
7720115 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7720116 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7720117 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas
7720118 by raising the tax on our truckies fuel how that leads to lower grocery prices for working families is beyond me
7720119 well certainly be having a close look at that one in the senate
7720120 they themselves have claimed responsibility for several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people

7720124 his contribution and level of commitment to service and quality patient care will be a valuable asset to hazelden as we grow and innovate
7720125 professionally he has the business acumen crucial to meeting the challenges hazelden faces
7720126 on the other hand as a person in long term recovery he understands the heart and soul of what the mission is
7720127 nou niet echt meer dan vroeger volgens mij ik val wel eens in slaap op de bank maar dat had ik altijd al
7720128 maar de laatste tijd overvalt de vermoeidheid me soms wel ineens
7720129 ja ik kan het namelijk aan u zien u ziet er nders uit dan in het begin
7720130 maar ik heb nu eenmaal hangogen dat komt ook door mijn leeftijd ik word natuurlijk ook ouder
7720131 nou ja misschien ben ik wel moe maar ontken ik het gewoon
7720132 ej kijk eens even het lijkt wel of er kuilen komen onder mijn jukbeenderen vind jij dat ook
7720133 demographic and political changes along with the obama campaigns grassroots and internet organizing are likely to change the electoral map
7720134 judging by black participation in 2008 democratic presidential primaries during which black turnout increased by 115 percent the democrats prospects look exceptionally good
7720135 the law is whatever the nobles do undue process at the fcc
7720136 to have both created a new set of such procedures at the same time it applied them to comcast and established a new framework for handling similar complaints in the future
7720137 such sums as may be necessary for each subsequent fiscal year
7720138 katrina showed us that we cant rely on levees alone for protection
7720139 this poll shows louisianans overwhelmingly believe that we need to preserve our wetlands and coastal areas in order to protect our people communities and jobs the good news is that the vast majority of those polled believe we can rebuild the wetlands and coastal areas weve lost
7720140 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7720141 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7720142 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7720143 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7720144 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7720145 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7720146 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7720147 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7720148 sarada was depressed because she had a lot of pressure from her husband to send money her husband was very sick the money she was sending was all spent on medical costs she was very upset about this because she wanted the money for her children to go to school
7720149 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7720150 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
7720151 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
7720152 i was locked in for two days and they the employers did not give me food and water then after two days i wanted to run away the apartment was on the fifth floor i tried to go down using cable wires running along the wall of building the cable broke and i do not remember what happened afterwards
7720153 most deaths resulting from a building fall are failed attempts to escape
7720154 dont call this an embassy we have become a funeral parlor people die natural deaths accidents suicide when they try to run away accidents happen
7720155 when employers lock someone up inside a home they are committing a crime and the police should treat it as such
7720156 is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
7720157 from working with many cruise clients and taking specialist courses i found there was a need for an agency that provides high end adventure travel thus adventure luxury travel was born
7720158 i found that many of my clients are looking for an agent that can provide them with hard adventure
7720159 like river rafting in colombia bungee jumping and green hunts in south africa or soft adventure like trekking borneo shark cage diving and snorkeling in south africa safari in tanzania or just in fiji but at the end of the day returning to four or even in the bush these are the unique itineraries i provide my clients
7720160 almost all of the trips you see featured on my website have been designed by myself working with my suppliers in response to a particular client request
7720161 my blog is going to focus on the specific areas i service with a passion
7720162 those areas will be luxury travel to adventure travel and where the best areas are for a particular adventure while avoiding the large tourist crowds i would also like to discuss the benefits and value in using and supporting the local suppliers of unique itineraries as they can provide an in depth insight into the areas you are traveling to and provide divers and anywhere in the world as i have personal supplier contacts in many out of the way countries that are just a blip on the radar screen but that will be major tourist attractions in the near future interested readers should contact me for information on these areas if they are looking for something new or thrilling
7720163 a shared desire a yearning for limitless resistance something more
7720164 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7720165 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7720166 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7720167 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7720168 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7720169 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7720170 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7720171 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7720172 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7720173 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7720174 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7720175 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient
7720176 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7720177 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7720178 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7720179 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7720180 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7720181 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7720182 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7720183 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7720184 this is an exciting event not only will we be able to crown our long course triathlon national championships but we will also be crowning our club national champions
7720185 athletes of all experience levels will have the opportunity to contribute to their clubs scoring whether it be the sprint intermediate or long course distance event clubs will be able to bring athletes of all experience levels to compete
7720186 we are excited to be working with the redman triathlon group
7720187 with their good reputation and completion of usats race director certification course we are confident that athletes will experience a top notch event

7720199 but senator biden was simply using reverse psychology on those arabs yes arabs while bush and cheney and rumsfeld were drowning in the iraqi chaos they themselves had seeded biden brought the iraqi factions together by giving them a common object of contempt himself see how brilliant he is
7720200 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7720201 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7720202 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7720203 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7720204 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest

7720259 economics as studied by american high school students from basic principles to practical application
7720260 focusing more on the way of thinking than on knowledge
7720261 until now i had absolutely never read a book about economics so i decided to read this book intended for american high school students since im a beginner in economics actually it was still quite difficult however i am stunned that economics content of this sort is taught to american high school students in japan it is extremely unusual for people to aim to become entrepreneurs but if at high school age people were taught from textbooks with this sort of content then instead of the most favored career path being famous universities government bureaucrat positions and positions with big corporations many students would think that the best thing to do is to try to become an entrepreneur make a profit start a new company and change the world
7720262 at this high price everyone is just going to go to the cd rental shop
7720263 the practice by japans recording industry of trying to earn as much as possible while they can embarrasses us before the world

7720272 ha ca do de manera significativa el precio de las gasolinas en estados unidos y esta convergencia a precios internacionales que es deseable se est haciendo de manera gradual que es como lo ten amos previsto al hacer nuestras proyecciones de inflaci n
7720273 y esperamos que la trayectoria de la inflaci n se ajuste a las previsiones que publicamos en nuestro informe de inflaci n
7720274 lo sorprendente es que no haya ca do m s porque ha habido un desplome en la industria de la construcci n en estados unidos
7720275 porque muchas veces los aumentos de precios se dan protegi ndose ante un pron stico de que va a subir la estructura de costos y a la medida en que haya ese anclaje con la pol tica restrictiva los precios deben mantenerse controlados

7720323 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7720324 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7720325 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy
7720326 i dont think you can worry about all the stuff you cant control
7720327 i jogged over to the defensive side and had to do a u turn and go back to the offense
7720328 i realized i didnt have the blue jersey on i had the white one on

7720332 its not anwar versus the other candidate its anwar versus the entire government machinery
7720333 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7720334 i have no more faith in umno because theres corruption and abuse of power

7720352 we shall continue to emphasise and carry out our task of monitoring fairness and respect wherever people are imprisoned and point out the major disadvantages of prisons of a size that present serious management problems
7720353 the consultation is still underway and the government welcomes the imbs contribution to the debate these new titan prison complexes will not be warehouses prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour
7720354 the complexes will also be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained

7720409 i first started going to faith i think almost at the end of may 2005 when gardena first umc merged with faith umc it was really different compared to the church that i attended when i was still in philippines my mom was actually a member of gardena first i dont know any church yet aside from gardena first and fumc that time but i am glad because i became a part of this church
7720410 ive been a member for 2 years now but ive been attending faith since may 2005 i am so happy that i am part of this church my new home
7720411 its been 2 years now i feel so blessed to be a part of this ministry i am so thankful to god because this ministry is growing and i am sure a lot of exciting things will happen because god is leading us towards a new life his works are so awesome that i myself cant express how great he is

7720422 there are some very good things for veterans here especially for severely injured veterans returning from afghanistan and iraq
7720423 to take a graphic case if you go to iraq with two legs and come back with one you might have eight other aspects to your claim visual auditory shrapnel wounds et cetera the average time right now to adjudicate an entire claim is over six months but why make a veteran wait for that part of the claim not in dispute especially since we have record numbers of suicides divorces and bankruptcies among veterans

7720436 the only reason i have anything open today is i had a family relocate and two men moved out i guarantee by tomorrow itll be full again
7720437 its easy to bounce back when you have one thing go wrong
7720438 said spader who has never lived in a shelter until now
7720439 but then when you lose your job and then you lose shelter and then you lose transportation its very very difficult its a cycle you cant get a job if you cant get there but you cant get a car if you dont have a job
7720440 its much more difficult for individuals grappling with emotional programs to compete successfully in the economic arena
7720441 its harder for them to focus on issues of livelihood when they are depressed they cant sleep or theyre drinking too much
7720442 everywhere across the country people are dealing with veterans in crisis and we have to assume that this is going to eventually impact us here
7720443 we were a resource to veterans struggling with addiction because they could utilize our shelter while they were dealing with this
7720444 post implementation of the city councils requirements we will be required to bar them
7720445 its disgraceful that people who served their country come home to live on the streets

7720448 he had a lot of trouble sleeping drank more than he had before he had some you know not fights because he wasnt in a condition to fight but you know he had some incidents

7720452 when i get put in stressful situations sometimes i just well the two things i pled guilty to
7720453 thats not how somebody should react to a situation like that
7720454 plaintiffs and defendants like it because it implies causation and it seems to be something that any of us developed if we were put in that situation
7720455 my hunch is that military juries will be sympathetic to it in a way that civilian juries wont theyll be more familiar with what deployment is like
7720456 the courts have really tightened up the rules on diminished capacity in recent years
7720457 if there is an environment that adds to the stress level theyre going to recognize that it can turn into reasonable doubt
7720458 the judge took this fact into consideration when deciding the sentence
7720459 so i think its a half and half chance if you can present strong and reliable evidence of your mental illness it helps
7720460 our focus is on making sure that any soldier charged with misconduct and there is associated issues stemming from the war zone be it ptsd or tbi traumatic brain injury or other disorders we bring these issues to light for the fact finder
7720461 there is a push from the army for leaders to be aware of ptsd and tbi commanders recognize these issues are relevant and these types of injuries are occurring
7720462 can criminal activity manifest itself as a symptom of ptsd
7720463 yes due to the angry outbursts the aggression the startle response the anxiety the fear involved
7720464 if things go well and we are called to lakeview will rick be thrown to the wolves

7720567 you know honestly thats probably what i would attribute it to the injuries dont have much in common ryan zimmerman he was sliding austin kearns he had loose bodies in his elbow none of those are conditioning things none of those have to do with training
7720568 if there was something we could identify from a conditioning standpoint we would address that but you look at it there is no overlapping root cause i cant think of things in particular i would advocate doing differently
7720569 the training staff knew right away that i was hurt
7720570 but everybody hurts in baseball nobody feels good so step one is you determining whether youre healthy whether it doesnt hurt enough to say anything everybody appreciates someone who goes out and plays if youre injured but can you be the same player or are you hurting the team
7720571 i cant get in their heads because different guys one guy may tell you im fine and then another might tell you that hey im dead you know youve got to know the player and see it for what its worth youve got to observe him too when hes on the field a lot of it is observation
7720572 but i think it may have affected us more just because of who it bit its the front line guys here who have gotten hurt thats all

7720637 but this team has more than leadership they have heart
7720638 i just think it takes hard work and heart i think a lot of teams are going to look down on us thinking were going to be easy but i think if we just work hard i think we can stick with the best teams out there we just have to out our heart into it all of our work into and just hopefully we can play as good as they are
7720639 another thing theyll need to keep up in the region is for the younger players to step up thats why senior leaders like ian anderson will be there to encourage the first time starters
7720640 we just gotta get the new guys in keep their spirits up if they do something wrong encourage them to keep trying work harder just keep them in the game

7720666 ieder mens op zijn eigen manier we leveren allemaal ons deel op ons eigen niveau
7720667 then property values started tumbling everywhere and who knows what it is now it must be in the low 700s or high 600s
7720668 its 450 600 to pay for my own appraisal why would i do their job when they should do this for everyone in the county
7720669 if hes not satisfied with our staffs review he has until september 15 to file an assessment appeal
7720670 we did not appraise as far back as 2002 because i dont think the market data would support a great reduction in sale prices from 2002 there may be an isolated incident or pocket and i would encourage those people who believe their properties are worth less to file an appeal
7720671 the pitcher i played with for eight years and we won the national title together and the sponsor was one of the bigger sponsors that when i went to go play took me under his wing and made me and my family feel at home it was really easy to go play and probably wont have played that long if i would not have had people like that around me
7720672 ik heb ze zien aankomen vanmorgen volgens mij wel aardige mensen zij zei in ieder geval gedag dat is alweer heel wat

7720678 ooh frenk wat doe je dat g ed zeg dat bbq n lekker mals en z snel klaar
7720679 steek die hele biefstuk nou maar overdwars in je mond dan kun je tenminste even niet praten
7720680 we hebben op de afdeling zon computerfreak henk hij is zijn hele leven al single en nou hadden de collegas wat leuks voor hem bedacht een avondje uit en dan met zijn allen naar zon paaldansclub nou moet je weten dat hij echt een huismus is zo iemand die niet van het leven weet te genieten hij komt elke dag met een broodzakje van zijn moeder ja echt waar
7720681 ik hou het niet meer wat kun je lachen met die jongen vind je hem niet om je te bescheuren
7720682 dus toen hing die danseres met haar billen voor zijn neus zijn bril besloeg helemaal haaaaaahaahoeehoe
7720683 oja toemaar duw me maar in de stront maak maar een slachtoffer van me
7720684 nee natuurlijk is er niets ik moest zelf even aan iets op mijn werk denken
7720685 mijn onderbuikgevoel heb ik weer terug geweldig die lui van dat bureau hadden het meteen door knap ons managementteam zat teveel in de ratio de mensen op de werkvloer moeten weer stralen ze moeten plezier hebben in wat ze doen zodat iedereen weer vertrouwen krijgt in de organisatie maar als wij al niet stralen hoe kun je dan je medewerkers inspireren ja daar ging het over
7720686 we hebben met het hele managementteam een traject van een jaar gevolgd nou dan leer je elkaar wel kennen het was hard werken maar ik ben er enorm van gegroeid ik kijk helemaal anders tegen het leven aan ja we hebben er weer zin in
7720687 ja dat is dora je kent haar natuurlijk niet dat was ik even vergeten ze werkt bij zon kledingwinkel hier in de stad misschien heb je haar daar wel eens ontmoet die tent zit aan de reguliersgracht herenkleding

7720691 the relentless perversity of its interpretations of the issues before the faculty senate
7720692 a university should not have any programming as res life conceives it at all
7720693 if university staff want to bring speakers onto campus they may do so and students do it all the time faculty may also do so but those events are not university programs that have been awarded the imprimatur of the university
7720694 when a faculty senate approves a course it is not given an official sanction or status by the university itself in the way that the res life curriculum has been
7720695 it is absurd to think that non faculty staff at the university should be able to teach anything they want without the approval of the faculty
7720696 it is the responsibility of the faculty to terminate programs in the dorms that in its considered view are inappropriate for a university
7720697 why cant a residence hall have intellectual activities and engage students in serious ideas
7720698 it can if it wanted to it could ask the faculty to organize such activities it could also ask the university itself to pay for such activities
7720699 even if a program like u delawares is offered on a voluntary basis and there are students who might want it it still shouldnt be offered by a university because a university should not itself support such programming
7720700 dorm residents can arrange for intellectual activities that engage serious ideas on their own but their having the right to do this doesnt mean that res life should be able to run its own programs at the universitys expense
7720701 the quality of the reslife program is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether it should be banned
7720702 this is absurd it is entirely relevant to the question whether the proposal should have been rejected as in fact it should have been
7720703 staff members at a university do not teach that is the function of the faculty there are widely recognized norms and standards for faculty instruction in the academy such as those adopted by the aaup because teaching is not the responsibility of staff members there are no comparable norms or standards for them
7720704 students pay tuition and attend college in order to be treated as students not global citizens
7720705 hill rom is pleased to celebrate the opening of this important addition to our global r amp d footprint
7720706 our innovation center in singapore represents an acceleration of our efforts to embed increasingly sophisticated and differentiated micro electronics and software in our products we also see the opening of this center as an important step in globalizing our products and presence
7720707 we congratulate hill rom on the opening of its asia pacific innovation center asia presents new growth opportunities for the medical technology industry with its growing ageing population and rising affluence against this backdrop singapore presents a strategic location for companies to tap on asias growth by forging strategic partnerships with our base of global industry partners research institutes and hospitals these partnerships will position singapore as a one stop location for companies to test bed and develop cost effective efficient healthcare systems and solutions for the regional and global markets
7720708 innovation and partnering are key levers for a successful medical technology company like hill rom
7720709 thats why we saw singapore as a perfect location not only does singapore offer great technical talent but also it provides an environment with sophisticated health care institutions and a strong government supportive of growth as our r amp d center ramps up we are looking to collaborate with our asian partners to advance and test new bed technologies and business models with the intent of raising the standard of care offered to patients and caregivers worldwide

7720712 when i catch my breath i am going to beat you for every mile
7720713 they want to see if there is any interest there
7720714 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7720715 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7720716 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7720717 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7720718 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7720719 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7720720 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7720721 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7720722 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7720723 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7720724 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7720725 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7720726 it is all down here from here you are now on the straight and narrow and no talk of fun for the rest of your life
7720727 theyre not here because of politics or olympics i just like being around successful people who told they were too old for the job

7720734 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
7720735 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
7720736 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message

7720751 saya menilai penelitian tentang obat herbal lebih menjanjikan kalau kita mau meneliti obat atau menemukan suatu obat lalu kita menang dengan obat kimia itu rasanya omong kosong karena apa teknologi kimia sintensis indonesia sudah tertinggal 100 200 tahun jadi tidak mungkin penelitian menggunakan bahan kimia dilakukan di indonesia satu satunya kalau kita mau menemukan obat asli indonesia hanya dengan obat herbal

7720772 what finally loses a mans soul the betrayal of his conscience or the betrayal of his heart
7720773 he accepted and came to terms the way in which his literary life his public life his private life and his secret life lined up like four rooms with guests tourists or temporary residents occasionally straying into one room or the other none of them necessarily knowing there were other rooms with other guests there was a door between the literary life and the public one through which someone might slip back and forth and a similar door between the private life and the secret and a hidden passage that ran directly from the secret to the literary but the only one who ever went in all the rooms was him the only one who even knew there were other rooms was him no one else was allowed access to all of him again and when he did things with people in the secret life that remained unknown to those in the private he understood this arrangement might just be a moral expediency to justify to himself infidelities and spiritual disarray even as he also persuaded himself and sometimes actually believed that it was the only arrangement keeping him sane

7720775 berlin once again and for the last time this century lay at the cross coordinates of historys indecision the final decade of the final century characterized by dissolution in the east and a contrivance of unity in the west which barely lasted five minutes beyond the contriving the gravity of authority verses the entropy of freedom the human races opposing impulses devouring eachother order consumed by anarchy and then reordering itself in the anarchy of each individuals building his own reich each reich imposed its own order much like the last reich which supposed humanity could be recreated in its image humanity knew the attraction of it it lied if it said it didnt it recognized the attraction not in its sense of self perfection but rather n its imperfections which it so despised and so yearned to transcend that longing for the fire that burned it clean of its humiliations in the nihilism that was left in the void of the obliterated conscience where every rampart had been reduced to rubble it longed to take care of god once and for all the smug mother fucker
7720776 one calculation based itself on historys denial of the human heart and the other on historys secret pursuit of the hearts expression if one hearts story was the pursuit and denial of love and if history was the pursuit and denial of freedom what lay at the arcs intersection except the missing moments consumed by memory the second that was consumed by a memory and then given back to time when the clock unwound itself from 5 55 55 to 5 55 54
7720777 what if time is relative not simply to the perspective of motion not simply to what the eye sees from a passing train or a rocket hurtling at the speed of light but to the heart as well and the speed at which it travels
7720778 in his hands like that you might have been a prayer in his hands like that you might have been something he thought he could mid wife into a new incarnation strong enough to withstand his love if not your own wrenching from you the choice that had been killing you since you chose that afternoon in paris between love and freedom after that you always insisted it could never again be one or the other after that it had to be both or neither you meant to find on your journey the intersection of the two and convince yourself that they could be the same road with two names you insisted on seeing the wholeness of everything in life but yourself which lay in bits and pieces around you like the doors and rafters of a broken house you thought the men only worshipped the bits and pieces of you you thought their worship had nothing to do with the whole of you looking out at it from the inside you thought your beauty was a thing apart from you you never understood how the thing they loved most wasnt your face but your voice how the thing they loved most was that fountain that trickled up from your heart to your mouth and showed everyone who you were your hearts broken wounded apirations to be better then you were or could be or better then anyone could be that was what he loved about you but he never believed freedom and love were the same road with two names he always believed they were two seperate roads and that it was always a matter of moving back and forth between them
7720779 i would defy my own passivity by making the world around me a more passive place where everythings ultimately inconsequential and nothings irrevocable where everything can be returned to the way it was before and every choice includes the option of reversing it when it turns out to be a mistake where risk isn t always a matter of life and death where at the end of the two years during which you turned your life upside down rearranging it from top to bottom you can wind up back where you started only a bit older and abut more broken closer to the end of everything then to the beginning
7720780 even as the fact of it becomes more overwhelming more unbearable some things are irrevocable if not circumstantially then in the heart and memory the heart and memory being the only two things that can puncture the flow of time through which hisses the the history of the future
7720781 because his love had seemed so enormous and his faith so pure they found his betrayal all the more incomprehensible
7720782 it infuriated him that she somehow felt love had let her down when he believed she had let love down
7720783 he no longer believed happiness was something pursued timelessly but rather that it was stumbled upon in a moment seized ruthlessly and sensually with the understanding that i too would pass as quickly as a father or youth or love
7720784 it was easier for her now to believe that their love was a lie then to accept the consequences of having once made the wrong choice
7720785 this new role was to embody the recent bitter revelations of a beautiful woman who had come to assume by the nature of their beauty even when they never quite believed in that beauty that their lives were always to be filled with a hundred romantic choices any of which could at some point be discarded or undone

7720874 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7720875 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7720876 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control

7720902 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
7720903 i had arrived there at 10 a m and it took me until 5 30 p m before i could file the complaint even when i had already done so i felt that the policemen were not receiving me properly and the investigator was not writing down what i said
7720904 they began to shoot those paint bombs at our children and our children got scared and fled
7720905 i wanted to approach to ask them why are you stealing our sheep but they are very fanatic people and they told me to leave the place immediately i didnt see bilal or the sheep where was bilal where were the sheep i was afraid i phoned the emergency number 100 they didnt answer it started to get dark were in the dark alone theyre cursing and shouting and im worried about my son and the sheep
7720906 i got the children used to not being afraid and i hope that it wont happen again i dont want to say that all of beit yatir is like that not everyone in the settlement is a thief and wicked its important to say that only a few and especially the one in the picture in recent months its become worse and theyve started to make a lot of trouble for us i feel it they try to steal sheep they try to run over sheep they throw stones at night and scare my children

7720915 hes not way out of shape but hes not in his best shape
7720916 they both have worked really hard they both have to get ready to play this week
7720917 they may try to organize them better give them more money so the facilities are adequate
7720918 the only solution here will be to recycle nutrients by returning all animal and humans manures to cultivated soil as asian farmers did for many centuries and as many ecological farmers have long advocated
7720919 i cant think of a worse system than having the the people making the decisions be the same ones who pay no price for being wrong
7720920 weve got a planet to save nothing less is at stake other than civilization as we know it today

7720938 with the tough task of having to replace almost a dozen seniors and a coach the honkers are looking to their veterans to lead the team
7720939 i think our strengths are our leadership weve got good seniors good senior leadership i mean they make sure we are a team were one unit and we stick together
7720940 but this team has more than leadership they have heart
7720941 i just think it takes hard work and heart i think a lot of teams are going to look down on us thinking were going to be easy but i think if we just work hard i think we can stick with the best teams out there we just have to out our heart into it all of our work into and just hopefully we can play as good as they are
7720942 another thing theyll need to keep up in the region is for the younger players to step up thats why senior leaders like ian anderson will be there to encourage the first time starters
7720943 we just gotta get the new guys in keep their spirits up if they do something wrong encourage them to keep trying work harder just keep them in the game

7720973 the hatter would take mercury and be able to bend pieces of felt and cloth into these crazy creations driving them batty at the same time which is fun but unfortunate for them
7720974 any time you take technology and mix it with an art it usually produces crazy results take the pocket watch for one its big and it says a ton about the person their station in life everyone all of a sudden needs to know the time before the cell phone did you need to reach anyone that fast no and before the pocket watch did you need to get anywhere that fast not really

7720986 there have been many instances where the staff turned down an appeal and the reinstatement committee reversed it
7720987 while we would have appreciated a staff ruling that would have put him on the field tomorrow we are grateful for the opportunity to be heard on thursday
7720988 they told us that theyd get us a prompt ruling
7720989 what prompt means im not exactly sure they have done what theyve told us theyve been looking at it promptly while ben and i would have hoped for a better ruling from the staff were confident well get a fair and good hearing from the committee
7720990 in a lot of ways he doesnt act like a rookie
7720991 im not going to be able to run like mike could
7720992 but there are a lot of things i think i do pretty well
7720993 that is the way everybody in this organization has approached it from the top down
7720994 we have some good veteran leadership here that keep it about the team its not about an individual its about us taking care of the things we need to take care of
7720995 i feel ive made some really good improvements i still have a long way to go
7720996 there are still some things that are certainly moving quickly in terms of recognizing coverages and different things like that
7720997 i have seen him do some things on the practice field that really surprise you
7720998 weve got five new players and i think were going to change the outlook of our team a little bit
7720999 i still think he has the fire i really do
7721000 its more of a time to be here than any just to show support for him and let him know that we care about him
7721001 all of these guys have calhouns voice in their head somewhere you know theres something he instilled in you that allows you to be who you are today
7721002 i would call home at 9 30 and hed be asleep
7721003 he would go home from work early which he never does he wanted to keep things normal but for the people who know him well it was obvious that he was running on fumes if theres anything i learned through this whole experience its that he is indeed as tough as i thought he was
7721004 they told me ive got about a month or month and a half to get myself back
7721005 it shouldnt have any effect on the season its something that happened its been taken care of taken care of very well and all reports are very good
7721006 he spoke about his cancer briefly and said he had to go through some difficult times he looks fine
7721007 he may still be a little weak but hes in good spirits thats just coach for you hes not going to let anything stand in his way or stop him its almost normal
7721008 its slower than id like it to be its not like all of a sudden the effects are gone the radiation does beat the hell out of you basically it just takes time
7721009 he handled it the way i thought he would in that he didnt let on to anybody that it was bothering him or that it was any kind of inconvenience
7721010 he came in to the office every day he never wants to give in to anything thats the great thing about him
7721011 this probably isnt funny but weve been fooling around with it saying calhoun 3 cancer 0 and its not a fair fight
7721012 i dont want to be the guy with the most victories in the graveyard the guy with the most money in the graveyard i just dont want to be in the graveyard eventually like everyone else my time will come but the way i feel about my family and the way i feel about my life the way i feel about a lot of things that i can still do and the joy i get out of living im not willing to give any of that up
7721013 if you get past one year youre in good shape

7721016 hes the kind of guy that who if he cant exercise he doesnt do well psychologically
7721017 im a private person and when we were first dealing with this i didnt want jim to go public
7721018 but if just one person listened and is helped by this then it makes it worthwhile
7721019 because i didnt really know what i was dealing with
7721020 this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears
7721021 oh not bad i think she loves her husband which is what i would hope

7721087 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described
7721088 to support jeremy call or email hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration and ask her to intervene in this case phone 613 996 4974 email
7721089 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
7721090 the body of the martyr abbas ali hmoud will stay in the building until the iillers are captured
7721091 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
7721092 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7721093 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7721094 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7721095 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7721096 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7721097 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7721098 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7721099 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings
7721100 i just lost my brother but i pray to god to save my son
7721101 a multi national division baghdad soldier died of wounds aug 25 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital the soldier was shot by a small arms attack during a dismounted patrol in northern baghdad the soldier was quickly transported to the medical faciality but later succumbed to the wounds
7721102 its my company and my answer is no to that im just going to say what i want since its my company

7721107 on second thought that might not be the best idea after all i dont really know why but it just strikes me as something that would not work
7721108 modern overhauls have just made her powers and personality more like supermans
7721109 im ready to party and im not afraid of props
7721110 we had credible inputs that the senior separatist leaders would be targeted by vested interests during the lal chowk march
7721111 our orders are clear to the deployed security men use of maximum restraint and minimum force
7721112 we have to solve the issue for the sake of industrialisation in the state we cant let the tatas to move out of west bengal

7721119 van helsing had a better werewolf as far as animation goes but the transformations were much less effective
7721120 the only way i could tell it was him was by his hands we have identical hands
7721121 great peace have they who love your law and nothing can make them stumble
7721122 i really hope this will be a way to expose the real danger we all are facing globally iran usa and russia hand in hand bringing the third world war
7721123 ahmadinejads mother is a jew and from the establishment of islamic republic in 1979 the crypto jews were in the highest position in decision making in the state
7721124 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran
7721125 proved to everyone that iran of today is an iran that is impossible to live with
7721126 fear of switching is the foundation of customer loyalty for pcs
7721127 travel is the australian birthright first the young went to europe then ordinary families discovered bali and then retirees got into the act visiting children and grandchildren dispersed by globalisation and adventure it is no accident the best guidebooks to the world lonely planet emanate from offices in melbourne nor that for decades at dinner parties across the nation only real estate talk interrupted the narratives of trips taken or trips planned
7721128 the habit of flying i have discovered since begbie propelled me out of wilful ignorance into research mode is about the worst impact a single person can exert on the fragile environment a jet is not the brilliant means of transporting us quickly to pleasurable destinations it is a toxic flying machine
7721129 all that air travel accounts for just 1 percent of australias total greenhouse gas emissions compare that to 1 5 percent worldwide and 3 5 percent in the u s and you wonder if aussies are doing that much damage and flying is still less polluting overall than driving 10 percent of australias ghg emissions come from cars that figure is 14 percent worldwide
7721130 sit here with me a minute i want you to hear this man speak remember momma said this hes going to be the first african american president of the united states
7721131 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7721132 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7721133 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7721134 we have to recognize however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7721135 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
7721136 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
7721137 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
7721138 we can use these data to highlight the need for international agreements to protect this threatened species
7721139 if president bush does what no world leader has ever done before fully protect these colossal areas of shallow and deep coral reefs seamounts and other vulnerable marine ecosystems in the pacific ocean now and forever
7721140 two years ago president bush shook the world when he made the northwestern hawaiian islands a marine national monument and what was then the worlds largest no take marine reserve
7721141 he gifted americans and the world by protecting life in an incredible area of ocean 1 200 miles long and 100 miles wide
7721142 if the president ultimately acts to protect these amazing areas of ocean to the fullest extent
7721143 his conservation legacy will rival that of president teddy roosevelt leadership in protecting our planet can and must come from republicans and democrats alike
7721144 the fate of our oceans is far more important than partisan politics
7721145 by using his presidential powers under the antiquities act and other statutes to fully protect ocean areas like he did in hawaii president bush could write a new chapter in the history of conservation
7721146 this could be the best thing ever for ocean conservation these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7721147 indeed theyre bigger than mexico countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere if the president gives full protection to these areas i am thrilled that president bush is considering this
7721148 as the georgia aquarium grows as a tourist destination our opportunity to promote conservation and education grows
7721149 the addition of nandi who inspired hundreds of thousands of people in south africa gives us the opportunity to elevate her as an ambassador for her species millions of people who may have never had the chance to see a manta ray will now have that chance at the georgia aquarium
7721150 the georgia aquariums success in moving whale sharks across the world gave us confidence that this was the right thing to do
7721151 we see this as a perfect opportunity to create an international partnership and continue nandis incredible story raising worldwide awareness about manta rays
7721152 flying the worlds largest ray a manta ray from one side of the world to the other and housing it in a u s aquarium for the first time is incredible having the opportunity to work with this animal and grow our understanding of this strange yet gentle giant will be an opportunity of a lifetime
7721153 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7721154 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7721155 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7721156 pet ownership is increasing globally the pet food industry is moving towards a constant increase of production and manufacturing and marketing premium and super premium products these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption while different raw material unsuitable for human consumption such as by products of the fish filleting industry could be used
7721157 i am not advocating the need to reduce significantly the fishmeal and fish oil use in aquaculture if it were to sustain in the long term in this regard it is important to note that all sectors associated with the aquaculture industry are making a concerted effort to reduce the use of forage fish
7721158 the central issue is not an advocacy of pets versus aquaculture or other agricultural animal husbandry activities but the need for a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource for human benefit
7721159 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
7721160 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
7721161 i started at tarifa in spain at 10 15 in the morning on 19 august and i swam to the other side to morocco the first way took 2 hours and 45 minutes which is a new world record then i swam back to spain but the weather was worse than before so i finished after 8 hours 48 minutes so the second way took me 60 hours and 11 minutes
7721162 it was because of the weather and because of the currents on the first way the currents were coming from the back but on the way back i was going against the currents also the water was colder on the way back on the first way it was about 21 degrees and on the way back it was only about 15 or 16 degrees
7721163 i think its because of the strong currents from the atlantic ocean where the water is colder than in the mediterranean sea
7721164 big boats and some animals such as sharks and whales
7721165 being able to read another animals mind and know what they were going to do next developed so we could catch and eat them and avoid being eaten by them
7721166 there is a belief and its backed up by the size of their brains that we respond to their intelligence and social make up
7721167 the survey shows that the ban of all cell phones would have low impact on safer driving compared to all other distractions while operating a vehicle
7721168 i can tell you its really quite hazardous a lot of people are so distracted theyre running stop signs red lights speeding not paying attention crossing the center lines and somebody is going to get hurt if they havent already
7721169 i think this ordinance makes extremely good sense for the health safety and welfare of the citizens of marquette

7721175 illa j is a young talent in his own right with many dimensions a real force whos obviously the product of great stock
7721176 a disturbing and undemocratic overreach not in the interest of either management or labor
7721177 runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard it risks silencing those who would speak
7721178 i have to take this 4000 00 course in order to graduate
7721179 lack of science historical inaccuracies and emphasis on anecdotal evidence and opinion
7721180 werowocomoco was designed and constructed over several centuries to convey a central place in tidewater political and religious life a role that continued in the early relationships with the english
7721181 from werowocomoco wahunsunacock dominated an impressive social network through which gifts tribute and power flowed
7721182 every time it was a low tide every time it rained every time the ground was plowed and i would go out and collect everything and indian artifacts seemed to accumulate and accumulate
7721183 excitement began building at the thought that we were placing our feet on the ground that could have been walked on by powhatan john smith and pocahontas
7721184 from the early colonial accounts we know that werowocomoco was a place of extraordinary power and the results of our excavations indicate that we need to expand our understanding of the villages role in the powhatan landscape
7721185 we are coming to see powhatan as a very politically savvy individual we see his actions in this process understand that there are two competing cultures each one trying to subjugate the other
7721186 both powhatan and john smith are individuals who are powerful and charismatic in this story and it is impossible to disassociate the two
7721187 the western area toward the york river could be the more secular portion the eastern area the more restricted making access to it perhaps of a sacred nature
7721188 powhatan social organization was defined by sharp inequities of status authority and wealth
7721189 as envisaged in smiths map of virginia published in 1612 the powhatan polity consisted of kings howses where weroances resided and ordinary howses along the rivers of the coastal plain
7721190 the similarity between this maps representation of james fort and the archaeological evidence at jamestown island suggests parallels may be possible between the map and features at werowocomoco
7721191 we think the ditches roughly match the concentric double ds but so far were still tracing them
7721192 the exciting thing for us is that so few villages from this period have been excavated
7721193 we know the ditches go back at least four hundred years before contact
7721194 balancing public engagement native collaboration and homeowner privacy is not simple in such locations
7721195 we want to treat this location with respect and also make sure that the indians be involved in werowocomoco and whatever takes place here
7721196 indians were living here in what today we call virginia long before the english arrived on their shores
7721197 when you consider that they were inhabiting these lands at least fifteen thousand years ago the last four hundred years become far less significant if viewed from this broader perspective of virginia history

7721203 the thing he might be able to tell us is things like were the two men standing on the boat waving before it happened or had the boat broken down or were they not watching and didnt see the wave
7721204 theres so many different variables and factors he might be able to help us with

7721209 like the president he hopes to succeed sen mccain does not believe the government has a real role to play in protecting americans from unscrupulous lending practices

7721245 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7721246 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7721247 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
7721248 i dont know why its there but i think its a blessing
7721249 it raises the hair on your neck it gives you chills
7721250 then i went and got my mother in law to tell her she was overwhelmed by it she was crying

7721253 we have to careful about saying too specifically what they are
7721254 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7721255 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7721256 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7721257 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity

7721271 it lets people see problems emerge before they actually hit an emergency department or hit a doctors office and in that way the advice being offered up is very cost effective

7721277 our findings confirm that social partnerships can be designed structured nurtured and maintained in a manner that will enable them to contribute to solving pressing social problems and to fulfilling important strategic objectives for companies and non profits
7721278 we know that the multinationals talk more than national companies about the good work they are doing in these partnerships there are various shades of bragging
7721279 but we have noted in new zealand that there is a uniquely kiwi way of working with non profits
7721280 our research demonstrates that social partnership in new zealand is seen as an integral part of corporate strategy and social responsibility to society
7721281 our early evidence suggests that factors such as enduring links shared understanding longevity of bridging members alignment with the institutional environment and structure have all contributed to the successful outcome of these collaborations

7721295 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7721296 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude
7721297 whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7721298 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7721321 le bureau dun s nateur huis clos dans un petit bureau et non pas correctement comme cela aurait d tre le cas
7721322 notre pays doit s rement tre d j occup par les troupes chinoises puisque nous craignons de d plaire
7721323 autocensur es de peur de remontrance comme la d j exprim lambassadeur de chine
7721324 qui fait preuve dune arrogance et de propos d plac s dans notre pays qui sont insupportables

7721326 barang siapa yang berpuasa ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan mengharapkan pahala maka akan dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampuni
7721327 betapa banyak orang berpuasa yang hanya memetik lapar dan dahaga
7721328 dalam menyambut kedatangan musim musim ibadah seorang hamba sangat membutuhkan bimbingan bantuan dan taufik dari allah taala cara meraih itu semua adalah dengan bertawakal kepada nya
7721329 padahal mereka tidaklah diperintahkan melainkan supaya beribadah kepada allah dengan mengikhlaskan ketaatan kepada nya
7721330 barang siapa yang mengamalkan suatu amalan yang tidak ada perintahnya dari kami maka amalan itu akan tertolak
7721331 hai fulan kau telah berbuat begini dan begitu kau telah berpuasa ramadhan kau telah shalat malam di bulan suci kau telah menunaikan amalan ini dan itu dengan sempurna
7721332 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka para manusia dari jalan mu yang lurus kemudian saya akan mendatangi mereka dari muka dan dari belakang mereka dari kanan dan dari kiri mereka
7721333 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaubatlah kepada allah dengan taubat yang semurni murninya mudah mudahan rabb kamu akan menghapuskan kesalahan kesalahanmu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam surga yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai
7721334 setiap keturunan adam itu banyak melakukan dosa dan sebaik baik orang yang berdosa adalah yang bertaubat
7721335 barang siapa yang tidak meninggalkan kata kata dusta dan perbuatannya maka niscaya allah tidak akan membutuhkan penahanan dirinya dari makanan dan minuman tidak membutuhkan puasanya
7721336 seandainya kamu berpuasa maka hendaknya pendengaranmu penglihatanmu dan lisanmu turut berpuasa dari dusta dan hal hal haram dan janganlah kamu menyakiti tetangga bersikap tenang dan berwibawalah di hari puasamu janganlah kamu jadikan hari puasamu dan hari tidak berpuasamu sama
7721337 inilah ketakwaan yang sejati adapun mencampur adukkan antara ketaatan dan kemaksiatan maka ini tidak masuk dalam bingkai takwa meski dibarengi dengan amalan amalan sunnah
7721338 kewajiban orang yang berpuasa adalah menahan diri dari hal hal mubah dan hal hal yang terlarang mengekang diri dari makanan minuman dan jima hubungan suami istri ini sebenarnya hanya sekedar menahan diri dari hal hal mubah yang diperbolehkan sementara itu ada hal hal terlarang yang tidak boleh kita langgar baik di bulan ramadhan maupun di bulan lainnya di bulan suci ini tentunya larangan tersebut menjadi lebih tegas maka sungguh sangat mengherankan kondisi orang yang berpuasa menahan diri dari hal hal yang pada dasarnya diperbolehkan seperti makan dan minum kemudian dia tidak berpuasa menahan diri dan tidak berpaling dari perbuatan perbuatan yang diharamkan di sepanjang zaman seperti ghibah mengadu domba mencaci mencela mengumpat dan lain lain semua ini merontokkan ganjaran puasa
7721339 dan tidaklah seseorang mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan suatu amalan yang lebih aku cintai daripada amalan amalan yang ku wajibkan
7721340 barang siapa yang shalat karena allah selama empat puluh hari dengan berjamaah dan selalu mendapatkan takbiratul ihram imam akan dituliskan baginya dua jaminan surat kebebasan bebas dari api neraka dan dari nifaq
7721341 carilah lailatul qadar pada malam malam ganjil dari sepuluh hari terakhir bulan ramadhan
7721342 demi allah aku mengetahuinya lailatul qadar perkiraan saya yang paling kuat dia jatuh pada malam yang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memerintahkan kami untuk bangun malam di dalamnya yaitu malam dua puluh tujuh
7721343 barang siapa yang ingin mencarinya lailatul qadar hendaklah ia mencarinya pada tujuh malam terakhir dari bulan ramadhan
7721344 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam jika memasuki sepuluh terakhir ramadhan beliau mengencangkan ikat pinggangnya menghidupkan malamnya dan membangunkan keluarganya
7721345 sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan batas akhir bagi amal seorang mukmin melainkan ajalnya
7721346 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam merupakan orang yang paling dermawan dan beliau lebih dermawan sekali di bulan ramadhan
7721347 alangkah buruknya tingkah mereka mereka tidak mengenal allah melainkan hanya di bulan ramadhan
7721348 seperti yang disampaikan kepadaku bahwa abu jahal bin hisyam berjumpa dengan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian ia berkata kepada beliau hai muhammad engkau harus berhenti mencela tuhan tuhan kami jika tidak maka kami akan mencela tuhan yang engkau sembah
7721349 seperti disebutkan kepadaku sejak saat itu rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berhenti dari memaki tuhan tuhan mereka vietnam

7721381 its hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this but unfortunately there are people who will stop at nothing to try to deceive voters and keep them away from the polls
7721382 whats worse these practices often target and exploit vulnerable populations such as minorities the disabled the elderly or the poor
7721383 although there is no reliable method to determine the exact number of registered aliens there is evidence that this is a significant and growing problem
7721384 a subsequent media analysis showed that at least 2000 votes were cast illegally in florida in the 2000 presidential election since the margin of victory was 537 votes the fraudulent votes were sufficient to affect the outcome of the election
7721385 played down the findings of experts who concluded last year that there was little voter fraud around the nation
7721386 though the original report said that among experts there is widespread but not unanimous agreement that there is little polling place fraud the final version of the report released to the public concluded in its executive summary that there is a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud

7721403 he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live
7721404 by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live
7721405 your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die
7721406 i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread which i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world

7721423 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7721424 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7721425 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7721426 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7721427 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7721440 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7721441 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7721442 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7721443 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7721444 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7721445 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7721446 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7721447 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7721448 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7721449 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7721450 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7721451 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7721452 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7721453 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7721454 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7721455 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7721456 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7721457 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7721458 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7721459 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7721460 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7721461 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7721462 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7721463 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7721464 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7721465 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7721466 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him
7721467 if the government is showing resolve they should be encouraged
7721468 if pakistan fails to overcome this problem the whole world will have failed
7721469 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7721470 killer apps makes or breaks any platform with github i think the git hub just scored one
7721471 whats amazing about github is how it really brings the social aspect into play chris and tom are showing us all visually how git development is supposed to work i know i personally had some bing moments once i started pulling in commits from external git repos
7721472 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future

7721474 millions of miniature robots called catoms so they could function as shape shifting swarms

7721491 am 26 november ist unsere tochter romy auf die welt gekommen
7721492 in der geburtsurkunde standen beim namen des vaters nur kreuzerl dabei hat sich werner unsere tochter so sehr gew nscht
7721493 erst im februar 2008 erfolgte der gerichtsbeschluss zur feststellung der vaterschaft und der auftrag f r ein gutachen
7721494 ich habe immer wieder angerufen nachgefragt ich war mit meinen nerven schon am ende weil ich das einfach nicht verstanden habe
7721495 ich musste in dieser zeit von 436 euro kindergeld und der familienbeihilfe leben wenn es nicht leute gegeben h tte die mich mit spenden unterst tzt h tten w re sich das alles nicht ausgegangen aber das schlimmste f r mich war dass werner so lange nicht als vater in der geburtsurkunde stand
7721496 ich garantiere ihnen dass der akt bei uns keine einzige minute auf einem schreibtisch herum gelegen ist aber solche verfahren dauern leider
7721497 den zeitraum f r das dna gutachten kann man sicher berdenken
7721498 we were wondering if larger animals also have this magnetic sense
7721499 sometimes it took hours and hours to find some pictures with good resolution
7721500 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7721501 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7721502 ive never noticed that my cows all face the same way
7721503 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible
7721504 we need to think about some really fundamental things that this sensory ability provides in animals
7721505 it looks like one guy just made a remark trying to act important one federal official told nbc news
7721506 however other sources have told 9news the three men may be connected to skinheads and that it appears they were involved in an assassination plot
7721507 adolf was wanted on seven outstanding warrants totally more than 1 million

7721515 alright diggers those who didnt see an assasination plot for obama happening by white supremacists please raise your hand
7721516 oh wow obama is amazing hes gonna get jobs for everyone hes gonna do this hes gonna do that
7721517 those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7721518 i believe a good example of this is massive citizen surveilance itll give you a little temporary safety for as long as it takes the criminals to notice the surveilance cams shortly thereafter criminals simply find ways around the surveilance cameras and now criminals are still criminals but honest citizens no longer have any privacy the same could be said for gun control outlawing guns will only give you some temporary safety as long it takes for the criminals to get guns illegally so now criminals still have guns but you as a citizen have lost a very essential liberty and have also lost a massive amount of safety in losing the ability to protect yourself with weapons to match those of the criminals
7721519 we do not not wish death upon those we disagree with
7721520 i play paintball and lacrosse and im a pretty nice person

7721527 firearms and methamphetamine were seized and a number of individuals are in state custody the matter continues to be under investigation well provide more information as it becomes available
7721528 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7721529 it looks like one guy just made a remark trying to act important
7721530 were trying to figure out what these guys had in mind
7721531 this is a methamphetamine and firearms case that arose from a traffic stop made by an aurora police officer firearms and methamphetamine were seized and a number of individual are in state custody the matter continues to be under investigation

7721540 each time jehudi had read three or four columns the king cut them off with a scribes knife and threw them into the fire in the brazier until the whole of the scroll had been burned in the brazier fire
7721541 where am i myself resisting the word of god what do i not want to hear
7721542 rolling up their sleeves to do everything they can to keep the program
7721543 i think mr lonegan is preposterous i think it should be noted somebody brought this to my attention that he decried public money for legislative campaigns but had no problem accepting it when he ran for governor
7721544 look what god has given us he has blessed us with this and this
7721545 well we could use another pair of shoes we have only sports shoes
7721546 katerina would love to have curtains some day but it is not a priority
7721547 we dont worry about that we just do exactly what god wants us to do look at the miracles he has provided all ready
7721548 because of the interest shown in the horse for a stud career i made the decision to retire him now

7721553 it the choice between front and rear wheel drive will be driven by what the customer wants and values and especially the fuel economy and the performance
7721554 all wheel drives and front wheel drives are pretty spectacular and theyre going to continue to get better
7721555 rear wheel drive has some unique capability but it is yet to be determined whether we keep our unique rear wheel drive or whether the bigger sedans including future falcons will move to all wheel drive or front wheel drive
7721556 we are aggressively transforming our product line to have more fuel efficient small and medium sized cars and utilities were doing that worldwide
7721557 the real focus to be successful long term is going to be that you have absolutely dynamite smaller vehicles to support worldwide customer preferences
7721558 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7721559 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7721560 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7721561 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7721562 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7721563 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7721564 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7721565 israel is in for a big surprise we are capable of firing thousands of missiles a day into israel

7721586 i am appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault to contact police it was a busy time of the evening and there were many young people in the area i am sure many of them would have seen what happened
7721587 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is indeed tragic our thoughts are with his family

7721604 it would be wrong for an advertiser to think that the same type of ad would work in a newspaper and a wap site it will fall flat
7721605 with so many religions in this world how do i know mine is the correct one and all others are wrong is it possible that the millions of people in other religions are following delusional ideologies
7721606 in fact maybe god is just like a universal natural force
7721607 banning fifty and perfection is like a rite of passage for a mod
7721608 to argue with a man who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead
7721609 with so many religions in this world how do i know mine is the correct one and all others are wrong is it possible that the millions of people in other religions are following delusional ideologies

7721619 it is one we could not have possibly imagined when we came here and it is just the opportunity just to drive the project for us but take nothing away from those guys who just performed way beyond what i think any of us really expected
7721620 now it is not just a case of the athletes and the sporting part but it is we are going to host it
7721621 so there is so much more to do and i think it is something we have got the momentum now and i think the public really is behind it now so let us go forward i think yeah we have got a perfect opportunity
7721622 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7721623 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process

7721632 by those who have the power and the collective will to shape it
7721633 mccain s foreign policy would consist entirely of looking for reasons to fight with russia and china

7721673 estou confiante de que tudo ficar bem na noite da quarta feira
7721674 with the success theyve had theres no selfish guys on this team
7721675 its different than toronto everyone talks to everyone and when you come into a situation like that you have to feel good about it from the first time i walked into the locker room i was greeted its a different team and a different atmosphere
7721676 i had the opportunity to work with the first group on offence completed some throws and threw three touchdown passes its a good situation to be in but i know i have to go out and not press too much but getting this opportunity says a lot about the coaching staff and my new teammates
7721677 because of the injury situation we had to alter our offence
7721678 when we traded kerry joseph to toronto in march we felt wed have a good offensive line and a receiving corps equal to the better groups in the league but who couldve predicted losing half our offence to injury
7721679 so weve had to change our strategy and need an athletic quarterback to give us pass rush options and open things up for running back wes cates
7721680 any time you make a change of this magnitude with a person as highly respected as marcus theres going to be emotion
7721681 in the big picture you understand that players are people who wear jerseys for a living they have strong relationships and theres going to be a reaction
7721682 but we have a strong group and theyll bounce back and you could see that yesterday
7721683 she hit so deep that it was hard to change direction on the ball and move her around
7721684 it was a learning experience playing on arthur ashe against a good player i just want to keep getting better in terms of tennis and my fitness
7721685 i think i help him a little bit to play to that level
7721686 sure hes good player he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity i play a little bit less intensity than the last few months
7721687 its kind of weird that theyre switching week to week with playing no tournaments
7721688 its a little bit unfortunate you would almost rather have a clear cut no 1 or a really fantastic race like on the mens side where the players are winning the big ones to become no 1
7721689 i think it causes confusion just based on the weekly changes
7721690 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7721691 sarada was depressed because she had a lot of pressure from her husband to send money her husband was very sick the money she was sending was all spent on medical costs she was very upset about this because she wanted the money for her children to go to school
7721692 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7721693 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
7721694 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
7721695 i was locked in for two days and they the employers did not give me food and water then after two days i wanted to run away the apartment was on the fifth floor i tried to go down using cable wires running along the wall of building the cable broke and i do not remember what happened afterwards
7721696 most deaths resulting from a building fall are failed attempts to escape
7721697 dont call this an embassy we have become a funeral parlor people die natural deaths accidents suicide when they try to run away accidents happen
7721698 when employers lock someone up inside a home they are committing a crime and the police should treat it as such
7721699 i used to work in a fire hydrant factory you couldnt park anywhere near the place
7721700 patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons
7721701 hell only go out until the rosters expand and then hell be back trembley said
7721702 no big deal it happens they had to make a move a needed move take it as it is i picked up a lot here in two days
7721703 the agreement may be extended if so agreed by both parties
7721704 appeal for peace emergency preparedness and response in the wake of the escalating conflict in mindanao
7721705 not so much lost in translation as converted into alien poetry
7721706 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7721707 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7721708 millions of miniature robots called catoms so they could function as shape shifting swarms
7721709 this is the biggest fight that can be made right now
7721710 its bigger than brett rogers its bigger than sean gannon millions and millions have been entertained by ken shamrock over the years in japan in the ufc and in the wwf now the wwe hes the biggest proven pay per view commodity in the sport together those two will maximize the eyeballs for mixed martial arts on oct 4th
7721711 its a very very legit and dangerous fight for both sides
7721712 ken says hes seen holes in kimbos game like swiss cheese and hes looking to expose them and kimbo slice is the baddest man standing today in any combat sport
7721713 he beat a mma legend ufc hall of famer and pioneer of the sport
7721714 however resurrecting the street fighting past of two fighters with a combined five pro fights between them would have been too much of a sideshow for network tv and alienated scores of mma pu
7721715 its a very very legit and dangerous fight for both sides
7721716 ken says hes seen holes in kimbos game like swiss cheese and hes looking to expose them and kimbo slice is the baddest man standing today in any combat sport
7721717 kimbo slice is the baddest man standing today in any combat sport
7721718 donald robert seddon of 824 17th st santa monica was apparently a rather jealous individual while cruising the streets of los angeles one night he thought he saw his wife in a car with another man at warner drive and wilshire he rammed his car into the other vehicle then spun into a third seddon in fact rammed the car of total strangers david r north and his wife patricia both 22 of 1541 s st andrews place as it turned out the third car was carrying some prominent people tony curtis and his wife janet leigh dean martin and his wife jean and songwriter sammy cahn and his wife gloria delson they were headed home after a party at peter lawfords house fortunately frank sinatra was right behind them and contacted police with the radiotelephone in his car
7721719 no problem val i understand this towns roads are crazy etc etc
7721720 while you take care of that i am going to run to the ladies room
7721721 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year
7721722 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter this coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
7721723 medicare payment error rate said to be much higher than reported
7721724 ive always thought that the blue collar vote had to be a source of his strength
7721725 it always seemed to me that mcgovern not as the anti war candidate but as the change candidate would appeal more to middle america than he would to any other group theyre the ones with the most to gain from change and theyre the ones who get screwed by the way we do business in this country
7721726 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7721727 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7721728 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7721729 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7721730 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7721731 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7721732 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7721733 papi youre gonna have to go down to social services
7721734 so i call this number and ill have a place to stay tonite
7721735 its old media meets new media its new media meet new media im just here to meet somebody

7721743 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in

7721745 senator obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002
7721746 let me state what i think about their tactics im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7721747 anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with barack obama than they do with john mccain
7721748 not just fighting for a particular person we were fighting to take our country back
7721749 may have started on different paths but we are on the same journey now
7721750 she was the best but now we have to be together
7721751 what do you want me to tell you sweetie im very sad but its ok maybe in four years
7721752 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7721753 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7721754 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7721755 my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7721756 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7721757 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7721758 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7721759 we say that john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7721760 is a 21st century patriot who sees beyond the years
7721761 i know what a great leader can do to help us find common ground america we need such a leader today a leader who can heal the wounds of the last eight years a leader who knows that what unites us is greater than what divides us
7721762 i said mr president you can say whatever you like bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics
7721763 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
7721764 the kind of people who bring dogs here treat dogs like their kids
7721765 the best thing is that they give me so much love everyday i look forward to coming to work everyday
7721766 weve also seized 8 000 in cash three cars recovered two stolen 4 wheelers and one stolen car
7721767 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7721768 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7721769 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7721770 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7721771 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7721772 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7721773 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7721774 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7721775 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7721776 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalized form by the government as a new settlement close by adam

7721805 abrams understand that hes making a movie for the fans primarily we always felt that as well we always treated everything with so much respect ok how is this done there were things that were very appointed that we should not be tampering with and i needed to know specific details anyone like me can go and see this movie and be blown away regardless because theyre starting from the moment they walk in the theater but for the fans were picking up where others left off we needed to know how to do things in a way that wont change their history of star trek
7721806 im used to it now though because heroes is the same way you know its so funny because actually in the movie in the climax of the movie when spock actually oh no i dont ever find myself ive gotten really good at being evasive cagey and evasive
7721807 you know challenging and exciting and every day was something new and the scale of it was pretty epic so we had a really good time j j managed to keep it like all about what we had right in front of us every day even though we were in the midst of something sort of huge and life changing and hopefully really impactful it felt like we knew what we had to go to do everyday at work so that was cool
7721808 its great that theres an outlet and that theres a support system like a structure in place
7721809 that gives people that are so enthusiastic about these projects a place to go and channel their energy and show enthusiasm
7721810 as someone who has been a part of heroes now and now star trek i feel that its really cool and people have been incredibly warm and supportive and encouraging and enthusiastic about everything so i feel like as long as that is the case im happy to be around
7721811 when you see this movie youll understand that this story happens sort of irrespective of where the spock that weve come to know ends up if that makes sense

7721827 brain shrinkage increases with age in all people the early decreases seen in alcoholics may make them more vulnerable to cognitive decline and dementia as they grow older
7721828 was that the alcohol dependent women showed less activation in brain areas that are needed for spatial tasks like puzzles maps and mechanics and for working with information that is held mentally like doing math inside your head or making sense of a lecture or set of complex instructions the brain parts that showed the differences are in areas that we need for finding our way around and working with all the information we are bombarded with in everyday life
7721829 the young women with alcohol dependence appeared to engage their cortical systems less vigorously in some cases the brain systems activated by the alcoholic women were different from those activated by individuals with no alcohol problems
7721830 one interpretation of these differences is that the alcoholic women tend to invoke brain systems that are less appropriately tuned for the task at hand or perhaps the activation is not as intense as it might be without their history of alcohol dependence
7721831 you know this opposing viewpoints guy could have chosen a better way to say these things but if you think about what he is trying to say it actually makes a lot of sense there is actually a small amount of very intelligent logic hiding behind his unpolished presentation

7721845 ich entdeckte warum mein vater mich napoleon nannte ich hatte einen gro onkel der napoleon hill hie und der multimillion r war und mein vater hatte gehofft dass er mir weil ich seinen namen trug eines tages etwas von seinem geld hinterlassen w rde doch als er dann starb ich war 14 jahre alt hinterlie er unserem arm der familie nichts und ich denke das war der gr te gefallen den mir jemals irgendjemand getan hat denn da ich nicht geerbt hatte war ich gezwungen arbeiten zu gehen und zu lernen mein eigenes geld zu verdienen der zweite gro e gefallen den mir jemand erwiesen hat kam von andrew carnegie
7721846 dieses interview hat jetzt erst angefangen komm mit zu mir nach hause und lass uns nach dem abendessen weiter dar ber reden
7721847 wenn er gesagt h tte gehe ihn ein hotel und komme morgen fr h zur ck dann w re ich dazu nicht in der lage gewesen denn ich hatte nur genug geld dabei um meinen zugfahrschein f r die r ckfahrt zu bezahlen
7721848 nach dem abendessen gingen wir in seine bibliothek und sprachen ber die notwendigkeit dass das was m nner wie er in ihrem leben durch versuch und fehler gelernt haben an zuk nftige generationen weiterzugeben
7721849 niemand hat bisher diese informationen organisiert und sie den einfachen menschen auf der stra e zug nglich gemacht
7721850 ich habe dir jetzt seit drei tagen von dieser neuen philosophie erz hlt ich habe dir alles gesagt was ich dar ber wei ber die m glichkeiten und potenziale ich m chte dir jetzt gerne eine frage stellen die du bitte mit einem einfachen ja oder nein beantwortest wenn ich dir den auftrag gebe der autor dieser philosophie zu werden und dir die empfehlungsschreiben f r die menschen gebe deren hilfe du ben tigen wirst w rst du dann bereit 20 jahre lang zu forschen denn so lange wird es dauern ohne dass ich dich daf r bezahle ja oder nein
7721851 zu diesem zeitpunkt wusste ich noch nicht dass wenn sich andrew carnegie einmal f r etwas entschieden hatte und er mir diese frage stellte er mir nur 60 sekunden zeit gab ja oder nein zu sagen
7721852 sechzig sekunden das ist alles ich sah die uhr nicht aber er sa dort hinter seinem schreibtisch mit seiner stoppuhr und ich brauchte genau 29 sekunden um mich zu entscheiden es zu tun
7721853 nun napoleon 20 jahre sind eine lange zeit und ich habe dir eine ziemliche schwierige aufgabe bergeben und du hast sie angenommen ich m chte dich warnen da du jetzt eine menge von verf hrungen auf dem weg erleben wirst lange bevor deine 20j hrige forschung abgeschlossen sein wird die gr te verf hrung von allen aufzugeben denn das ist genau das was schw chlinge tun sie geben auf
7721854 ich glaube nicht dass du ein schw chling bist wenn ich das gedacht h tte dann h tte ich dir diese chance nicht gegeben aber ich wei dass du etwas brauchst um die versuchungen aufzugeben zu berwinden
7721855 ich werde dir jetzt eine formel geben die dir helfen wird deinen geist so stark zu konditionieren dass nichts in dieser welt dich stoppen kann die aufgabe die ich dir bergeben habe erfolgreich abzuschlie en

7721859 er sagte mir wenn er nicht das geheimnis der elektrischen gl hlampe entdeckt h tte dann w re er jetzt im labor und w rde dort daran arbeiten anstelle seine zeit mit gespr chen mit mir zu vergeuden
7721860 weisst du ich musste erfolgreich sein denn ich war an dem punkt angekommen wo es nichts mehr gab das nicht funktionierte
7721861 ich habe dar ber sehr oft nachgedacht und mich gefragt warum nicht mehr menschen so lange weitermachen bis es nichts mehr gibt was nicht funktioniert
7721862 ich tue jeden tag das f r meinen erfolg notwendige mit spa und freude und energie

7721879 are impediments to achieving optimum operational efficiency as well as new product deployment slowly but surely many financial services firms that often rely on technologies that are nearly 30 years old are realizing the competitive advantage of modernizing their antiquated core systems
7721880 most insurance executives were concerned that their companies would be severely constrained by the limitations of inflexible complex legacy systems and the inability to obtain useful data
7721881 increasingly clear that the worlds leading property and casualty firms will need to replace their core policy administration infrastructure in order to address the demands of the 21st century

7721908 the impeachment process is not a partisan act it is simply a tool to protect the integrity of the constitution
7721909 if those who have violated the constitution are not held accountable then a dangerous precedent is set for future leaders to continue that violation with impunity that is why the framers of the constitution put this tool at our disposal

7721913 kita akan masuk parlimen dengan agenda yang jelas dan mereka bn patut bangun dengan menerima realitinya
7721914 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
7721915 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
7721916 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
7721917 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined
7721918 wouldnt it be nice if the scientists doing these experiments would focus on their scientific results and not feel the need to be policy advocates
7721919 it would appear economically appealing technologies are also cleaner technologies

7721922 i think weve made a serious mistake not developing the technology for 4th generation breeder reactors well before now
7721923 people who go to siggraph are researchers and well still do that but the end markets dont go to siggraph some of the hard core programmers will go but there but there are a lot of visual artists that dont go obviously there are a lot of gamers who dont go a lot of the actual car designers that dont go but the people who create the tools for the car designers go we think we need to create an industry event for visual computing that goes far beyond than just internal core siggraph is fabulous but we need something bigger than that we also wanted to define the industy like cisco defines the networking industry so a lot of the companies can say hey were in the visual computing business and people would understand what that meant

7721935 were also eliminating heavy magazines and opting for lightweight reading instead
7721936 our planes are flying with half or less than half filled water tank as it lightens the load and reduces fuel consumption and we are not the only airline doing this
7721937 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7721938 the whole week is going to be a do nothing week
7721939 the market doesnt dance with the same partner forever its all a matter of investors starting to look beyond the valley of all the problems to better times ahead
7721940 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path
7721941 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7721942 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar
7721943 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7721944 its becoming increasingly expensive for both fannie and freddie to fund their business
7721945 if thats not addressed fairly soon the companies will continue to be under stress
7721946 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
7721947 then you use less time shopping less time driving less aggravation overall you would spend less money
7721948 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7721949 weve basically been going through this standoff between buyers and sellers
7721950 were just seeing more and more increases in inventory and sales coming down
7721951 i cant buy another house until i sell my house up there
7721952 i dont really like to go to the mall its kind of boring and stressful
7721953 it seems more like a waste of time just to go all the way to the mall and browse
7721954 i just return it and get the right size who doesnt like getting stuff in the mail in the first place so clothes in the mail its even better
7721955 as you know these kids are online and wired more than ever before
7721956 in general its a tough economy out there for retailers but online seems to be the area where retailers are getting whatever growth theyre getting they are doing whatever they can to maximize that growth
7721957 is it going to be a strong back to school season in general its very tough out there
7721958 but if theres going to be growth i think that growth is going to come from the online channel
7721959 its becoming more elaborate than people realize between parent and child shopping online
7721960 we dont think theres necessarily an internet only shopper or a store only shopper
7721961 our goal as what we call a multichannel retailer is to offer customers this seamless experience regardless of how theyre choosing to shop with us
7721962 we know that a lot of customers will use the web site as a tool shop from it sometimes and then purchase online
7721963 other times they use it to look at what came in and then they come into the store and buy something theyve been looking at
7721964 being on bainbridge island requires us to take a ferry and or deal with driving in so many of the shopping situations
7721965 as time is fleeting we try to take advantage of the few opportunities we have to actually engage in an activity with them
7721966 with kids its difficult to shop for long periods of time
7721967 the biggest advantage for me was being able to shop on my own time
7721968 i think halloween costumes will be the next thing that will be coming around
7721969 and definitely online is a great place to go for that
7721970 its icky to go on and on about how much you love shelfari without mentioning youre paid by them
7721971 when you look at a book on amazon yes you see a lot of people who have commented on that book but you dont really have a relationship with those people
7721972 they might be thorough opinions or reviews but a review by someone you know or associate with would carry a lot more weight with consumers thats what we are building on
7721973 little is riskier to the national interest than more of the same
7721974 because the direction of wind and sunlight varied widely in the different locations the researchers conclude that the earths magnetic field is the common factor that could somehow be influencing the animals
7721975 feel it white boy nothings priceless it will always be about that money money
7721976 na sua dimens o social encontra se a garantia de renda para o trabalhador que perde o seu emprego permitindo lhe que tenha os meios necess rios para sustentar a si e a sua fam lia durante o per odo em que est em busca de um novo posto de trabalho
7721977 isto por um lado via de regra gera a possibilidade de o benefici rio receber o seguro e trabalhar no mercado informal ao mesmo tempo fraudando o sistema e drenando de forma il cita os recursos do fat
7721978 assim torna se importante que junto ao seguro desemprego o trabalhador desempregado seja envolvido em outras atividades e programas que resgatem a sua auto estima e lhe tragam novas habilidades para que possa conquistar uma nova ocupa o
7721979 we have something that voldermort doesnt have we have something worth fighting for
7721980 no disrespect to brett but its so blown out of proportion he was never really a part of this 2008 team as people would think he was here for a day and a half in the off season
7721981 the chemistry he and i had was different from the chemistry anyone else had with him because i played 10 years with him
7721982 some of these guys only played a year or two with him
7721983 he doesnt have a touch brett has a touch a rod is one of those guys who just has a fastball
7721984 if brett walked in here today he wouldnt think anything was different
7721985 if we have to pass an inordinate amount i have all the confidence in the world to go down that road with aaron

7722294 it is an event with the potential to carry a lot of stories the bump the birth the name the baby shower as opposed to a one time dui

7722297 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7722298 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7722299 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7722300 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7722301 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7722302 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7722303 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7722304 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7722305 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7722306 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives

7722313 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7722314 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7722315 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7722316 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7722317 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7722318 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7722319 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
7722320 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path

7722496 the real technology for the time period youre talking about was guts taking what you had and making it extend into deep water
7722497 phillips became the dominant driller in the oklahoma city field and subsequently mcgee became the companys chief geologist
7722498 would smell it and then tell them how much farther to drill
7722499 oil rigs pumps and tanks had to be relocated from the site mr mcgee and his wife both geologists and engineers could be found in hard hats sometimes at night reviewing the progress

7722511 after a certain upward point market momentum can become self perpetuating until it reaches such a peak as to collapse on itself much like putting too much air into a balloon
7722512 forecasters tell me much of florida will likely continue to see significant rain today exacerbating the flooding weve already seen
7722513 just as were getting done with this it does appear that there is another tropical storm that by next saturday is going to be in our neighborhood again

7722516 we need to look seriously at how to modernize our regulatory structure
7722517 what we have learned from the past two years is that the old form of regulation is broken
7722518 the exact form of the reform is something that we are learning about
7722519 once it gets going its supposed to be here for 36 hours
7722520 if its rained a lot in the past few hours watch out for any rising creeks throughout the area be very careful when driving on a road that has water standing it just takes a couple of inches to get your car off the road and start going somewhere you dont want to go
7722521 we would really have to have torrential rain for several areas to have any problems we need the rain
7722522 the easterly winds were used to our winds coming from the west so theyre real concerned about tree damage
7722523 if you have one come down through your roof make sure you call 911 so we can help take care of it

7722535 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7722551 babe it wasnt my fault i didnt know your brother would do that i had to hand it to him for a second while i ran in real quick i didnt think he would run off with it
7722552 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7722553 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7722554 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7722555 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7722556 it is not much at a difference of 4 6 db one might start to wonder if there is anything wrong
7722557 the mobile under test is equipped with a special test sim card the mobile is then mounted on an arm which in turn is fixed to a revolving plate when the door is closed it is not possible to see what is happening but things are moving inside the chamber to simulate a real environment
7722558 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7722559 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7722560 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7722561 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7722562 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7722563 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7722564 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7722565 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7722566 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7722567 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7722568 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7722569 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7722570 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7722571 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7722572 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7722573 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7722574 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7722575 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7722576 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7722577 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7722578 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7722579 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7722580 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7722581 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7722582 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7722583 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7722584 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7722585 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7722586 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7722587 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7722588 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7722589 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7722590 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7722591 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7722592 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7722593 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7722594 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7722595 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7722596 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7722597 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7722598 for those of you without hope we have rooms with color tv cable and air conditioning

7722607 what proof do you have that iraq has weapons of mass destruction
7722608 you never asked someone who goes into areas of the internet that are
7722609 we are committed to googlers and providing them a great working environment but we dont comment on internal specifics
7722610 how did you guys do that how did you pack so much valuable and tightly scoped information in such a small amount of space
7722611 the number of cases referred from law enforcement in years past was much smaller
7722612 nice car but itd be really nice with a gm ls7
7722613 the m3 coupe doesnt quite do it for me but the sedan just oozes rightness
7722614 i think network is going to take a page from the cablers and start developing scripted for summer as well
7722615 i dont think they will be able to get along over the next several years without going toe to toe with us in the summer
7722616 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7722617 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7722618 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7722619 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7722620 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7722621 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7722622 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7722623 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7722624 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7722625 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7722626 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7722627 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7722628 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7722629 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7722630 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7722631 yet still billy crystal and the college football legend makers stay away why why
7722632 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7722633 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7722634 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7722635 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7722636 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7722637 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7722638 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7722639 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her

7722646 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7723056 hal itu sangat disayangkan dalam era demokrasi perbedaan pendapat menentang kebijakan pemerintah disikapi dengan cara seperti itu
7723057 kenaikan ini terutama didorong oleh peningkatan pendapatan perusahaan yang cukup signifikan walaupun di saat yang bersamaan terjadi peningkatan biaya penyusutan jaringan pipa yang berasal dari proyek transmisi sswj proyek pipanisasi dari sumatera selatan ke jawa barat dimana saat ini sebagian besar telah selesai

7723062 dalam rapat umum pemegang saham luar biasa rupslb belum lama ini pemegang saham adhi hanya membolehkan perseroan melakukan tambahan modalnya sekitar 25 juta dolar as
7723063 jika adhi menambah modalnya 25 juta dolar as dan pemegang saham lainnya juga melakukan hal yang sama dengan menambah modalnya sehingga tercapai angka 144 juta dolar as maka kepemilikan adhi nantinya di proyek jm tinggal 20 persen atau berkurang dari pada saat ini sekitar 30 01 peresen
7723064 total piutang kami di proyek jm sekitar 126 73 miliar
7723065 kami sangat yakin pemerintah mempunyai jalan keluar atau solusi karena bagaimanapun proyek jm ini sangat dibutuhkan untuk mengatasi masalah transportasi di jakarta

7723080 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him
7723081 oh theyre probably just off looking at the train in the train room
7723082 theyre in there you can go ahead on in if you like
7723083 when you hear a report on the radio of no damage we normally get a couple of hundred claims the majority of the damage is inside properties
7723084 the building officers had a walk through town and there is no obvious sign of damage to buildings at all
7723085 when it happened we thought here we go but there was just nothing
7723086 it enables us to move beyond business as usual and take on the threats facing our environment that will inevitably effect all of us
7723087 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7723088 i think it was one of the most moving events that i have ever witnessed and i think we all love ted kennedy
7723089 he has been a stalwart and he is a very good friend and he clearly thought it was very important to deliver the message to make it clear that a torch has been passed to the next generation and as someone who has heard jack kennedy say that it was very moving
7723090 and that was reinforced watching him tonight i just felt very moved
7723091 i had never ever seen such a stirring speech in my life
7723092 i take away from it that there is hope that the greatest nation in the world have people who can actually bring change for a better world
7723093 its obvious that he had the courage and the energy and the will to be here to show what he represents to this party and to this nation
7723094 shes carried the memory of her fianc throughout her whole life
7723095 the video camera with tapes of family was taken and i need them to show my young children all about dad
7723096 it is an old model about 12 years old no use to anyone but my family
7723097 they deliberately trashed and broke things they deliberately threw ice cream and food from the freezer all over the floor they were real mean things to do

7723106 oh absolutely it pushed me all off season knowing that in the back of my mind
7723107 that was one thing we emphasized with him he gained about 15 pounds all the quarterbacks had a similar routine in the summer understanding the offense he does a great job with that
7723108 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
7723109 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7723110 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7723111 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7723112 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7723113 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect
7723114 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7723115 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7723116 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7723117 and i pledge to you i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the when we begin the great test
7723118 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7723119 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7723120 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7723121 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7723122 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7723123 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7723124 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7723125 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7723126 because patriotism is supporting your country all the time but your government only when it deserves it
7723127 malaysia is currently unable to fulfill the requirements of a voluntary partnership agreement with the eu because of widespread corruption at government level particularly in the timber rich state of sarawak

7723134 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7723135 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7723136 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7723137 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7723138 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7723139 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7723140 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7723141 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7723142 no i mean the place i work or well im a chef at bennigans
7723143 oh man dude i shouldnt have eaten that brown one man whoh like i can taste the bowling balls and the lane grease is flowing through me like the dahli llama
7723144 okay you dont exist kid i dont exist this isnt happening this isnt happening
7723145 these two men gave unto the devils temptation i will not speak of their actions for you vile creatures would get off on such a thing but i will promise you all this give in to the devils hands and you will march to your own shameful solitary hell
7723146 my name is francesca im moving in next door and i wanted to know if you could give me a hand
7723147 about a year ago i was living in a little shit hole almost as small as this very shit hole and i worked at some gloomy factory making refrigerator pumps i was so very alone in that huge building it seemed to stretch for miles and all but 50 employees counting myself inhabited this enormous hanger for machines and assembly lines i would work 12 hours without ever seeing more than a shift supervisor i began to imagine the war i vividly saw the soldiers killing and raping i smelled the blood of children and burning flesh i felt the plains shuttling over the crimson skies before they firebombed the color from the earth and i couldnt separate it i was 17 and in the factory at 38 i couldnt separate my realities both ive lived through bombs and dead faces bullets ripping through warm flesh and big machines and assembly lines pounding and vibrating burning metal and copper making product after product it was not at all different than war and i began to drink and drink one night after work i sat at a bar and drank my brain into a nightmare i left the bar and began walking down the street towards my shit hole a car flying down broke through a red light with ease it collided with an adjacent car heading through the same intersection the cars twisted together glass exploded tires melted and puked black smoke all over the streets the cars belched anti freeze and oil and water like a pig running across a shooting range and the entire atmosphere was war i ran to the mangled cars and tore a women from it her daughter was unconscious in the seat next to her i put my hands around her neck and ripped her throat out she was still alive i thought she was a soldier i walked around to the car who had sped through the light i saw a young man still inside bleeding from everywhere i helped him from his car and screamed
7723148 i think im going to have to take myself off the dating market
7723149 really does this mean that youve found a new man yay
7723150 keith the keith the one that called you 492 times a day after you broke up with him forcing you to cancel your cellular contract and seek service elsewhere which was not a deterrent to him at all it just forced him to be resourceful i e stalkerish and hack all the national cellular providers until he found your new service provider and your new number
7723151 yep in hindsight while it was semi stalkerish it was also a sign of his utter devotion to me and how super hot amazingly wonderful he believed me to be and yes i realize that

7723246 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
7723247 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
7723248 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7723249 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans

7723255 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7723256 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7723257 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7723258 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7723259 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won

7723261 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7723262 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7723263 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7723264 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7723265 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7723266 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7723267 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7723268 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7723269 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7723270 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7723271 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7723272 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7723273 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state

7723276 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7723277 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7723278 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7723279 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7723280 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7723281 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7723282 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7723283 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7723287 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7723288 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7723289 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7723290 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7723291 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7723292 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7723293 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7723294 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7723295 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7723296 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7723297 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7723298 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7723299 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7723560 he was a lot different player when he came back for two a days
7723561 he had been through the whole summer and the spring he was a lot different player to expect any player to play like that in his first game that really just kind of defines him

7723575 he inquires about his brother he says i want to go back to my class and finish my lessons
7723576 he had said that he wanted to get a musical party for his marriage since marriage is a one off thing he said he would like to have a great programme even if it meant spending

7723884 are working on a deal to give her some votes in the presidential nomination roll call but end the divided balloting quickly with a unanimous consent for obama
7723885 democratic officials involved in the negotiations say the idea is that at the start of the state by state roll call wednesday night delegates would cast their votes for clinton or obama but the voting would be cut off after a couple states perhaps ending with new york when clinton herself would call for a unanimous backing for obama from the convention floor
7723886 overall 62 of young voters report that they are excited 23 very excited 39 somewhat excited about the upcoming election including 69 of 18 to 24 year olds currently in college
7723887 in a moment that is sure to bring down the house
7723888 is expected to attend the democratic national convention most likely to deliver a speech tonight
7723889 buzz has built among massachusetts politicos that kennedy would come and yesterday a bay state democrat close to the family confirmed that kennedy has decided to travel to denver probably for an opening night address
7723890 obama will try to use this convention to increase his standing among democrats this convention is not aimed at persuading people who call themselves independents and moderates its about persuading people who lean left and call themselves democrats but who for many reasons arent sure about obama
7723891 it may come as a surprise that the democrats who will gather around the gavel in denver are actually more united than perhaps at any other point in the past 30 years
7723892 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7723893 mccain is being bolstered by ohio voters who supported hillary clinton in the states march 4 democratic primary and those who backed democratic gov ted strickland in 2006 mccain also is doing better among party loyalists 86 percent of republicans back mccain while 74 percent of democrats support obama
7723894 with colorado among at least seven battleground states that will swing this presidential election an obama lead here puts enormous pressure on john mccain should obama go on to win colorado it would almost force mccain to run the table with the remaining battleground states or lose the election
7723895 when the obama campaigns vice presidential vetters sought financial statements political speeches and medical records sen bidens team turned the grueling task into an opportunity to sell their man
7723896 because no public entity bank or otherwise has the balance sheet maneuverability in an impaired credit environment to conduct such business
7723897 if a law restricting gold ownership is impractical today i suppose the next best thing would be to restrict the supply of gold while shorting comex gold futures to suppress the gold price if my speculation on this turns out to be correct the scheme cant last for more than a few months as foreigners will smell this rat and begin to corner gold by massively hoarding the metals and eventually causing the gold ceiling to explode upward

7723913 the author is wrong the approach is a good one he just doesnt understand
7723914 ok thats what i want to be so but what really is so where does the truth lie
7723915 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7723916 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7723917 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7723918 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7723919 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7723920 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7723921 is truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7723922 not only will everybody in our delegation be on their feet when he comes out everybody will be standing on their seat
7723923 this is important for the convention because of all that hes meant to our party over the years
7723924 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7723925 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7723926 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7723927 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7723928 the greatest legacy kennedy would want would be an obama victory in november
7723929 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7723930 you could see it as the word spread around town today from person to person
7723931 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7723932 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know hes the best candidate because hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7723933 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7723934 the rachel john subplot set amidst the amish community makes the story special and unique its what we remember most about the film what moves us what interests us
7723935 we wouldnt permit this type of conduct in connection with the sale of cars or washing machines it is simply unconscionable that it occurred with a critical medical device

7723951 now then here we see first of all that we must not deem things by outward appearance but gauge deeper and seek the cause that moveth god to do the things which we think strange at first sight now then what is the end of our afflictions it is to make us to perceive our sins and it is a very noble point whereof we may gather a very profitable lesson true it is that we hear it oftentimes spoken of nevertheless we cannot hear of it too much for we know that afflictions are so irksome to us that every of us falleth to chafing as soon as we feel any stripe of the rod at gods hand and we cannot comfort ourselves nor keep ourselves in patience and therefore so much the more it behooves it us to mark well this doctrine that when god suffereth us to be vexed even wrongfully as in respect of the world even then doth he work our welfare in that it is his will to make us feel our sins and to show us what we be

7724019 we paid the city over 282 000 for the license which is more than the state formula of 250 000
7724020 in addition we estimate that the commonwealth and the city are losing 4 5 million each week that we are delayed in lost gaming tax revenue

7724143 the reality of aid in 2008 is that it continues to fail to promote human development for the eradication of poverty based on the core values of human rights democracy gender equality and environmental sustainability this is despite the appearance of progress in the form of high profile debt cancellations new aid pledges and the signing of the paris declaration on aid effectiveness
7724144 collaboration on development strategies that includes civil society organisations and other key actors could help achieve the principles of alignment and harmonisation while preserving the rich and powerful diversity that comes with a range of local development participants
7724145 the paris declaration has not given the necessary relevance to gender equality and womens empowerment issues gender responsive budgeting should be part and parcel of the aid effectiveness agenda at the high level forum because less funding impacts on progress towards gender equality and womens empowerment at country level especially in africa
7724146 the csos gathered in the parallel cso forum and the 80 accredited cso delegates to the hlf while very critical of progress to date will be pushing for real aid reform measures for aid effectiveness that give opportunity to citizens of donor and developing countries to reclaim their democratic mandate to have a say on global public goods and to control their future development

7724182 leadership comes as a birthright given the opportunity everyone can be a leader in his own field people in positions of power are leaders skilled individuals are leaders a knowledgeable individual is a leader and an entrepreneur who has created his own business and is committed to managing the business would be the leader of the business
7724183 leadership plays a key role in the survival and success of entrepreneurial ventures
7724184 leadership is more than a set of skills it relies on a number of subtle personal qualities that are hard to see but are very powerful these include things like enthusiasm integrity courage and humility first of all good leadership springs from a genuine concern for others
7724185 a person does not become a leader by virtue of some combination of traits but the pattern of personal characteristics of the leader must bear some relevant relationship to the characteristics activities and goals of the followers
7724186 entrepreneurship is the perception or recognition of an opportunity and the desire to exploit that opportunity for personal gain the successful entrepreneur combines the opportunity and desire with the ability to manage growth and change

7724204 pln lamban merespons kebutuhan listrik daerah padahal permintaan listrik saat ini terus meningkat dan listrik sekarang sudah jadi barang mahal
7724205 apa mungkin gangguan bisa terjadi berpindah pindah dan sangat sistematis seperti itu
7724206 karena pln sudah mengatakan tidak akan ada pemadaman bergilir namun kenyataannya justru masih terjadi
7724207 ayah aku terlalu lelah aku tidak sanggup lagi untuk berlari sudah terlalu jauh kita berlari bisakah kita berhenti barang sejenak sejenak saja
7724208 ini sungguh perbuatan zalim kalau masyarakat terlambat membayar rekening langsung dipotong tapi kalau listrik mati berbulan bulan kita hanya bisa urut dada

7724215 pln tidak professional jika memang tidak ada tenaga kerja untuk apa bicara lagian mengapa tidak merekrut tenaga kerja apa takut gaji mereka yang besar itu dipotong
7724216 akibatnya ya seperti itu petugas meteran hanya menebak nebak saja mungkin sambil tidur di rumah dia catat meteran
7724217 mereka mengaku kekurangan petugas pencatat meteran di lapangan mereka juga mengaku tidak sanggup selain itu mereka mengakui ada kesalahan pencatatan sehingga setelah dikoreksi dari rp 4 1 juta diturunkan menjadi rp 3 6 juta karena menganggap ini kesalahan di pihak pln pemilik toko meminta biaya itu diturunkan sehingga diberikan kompensasi dan disepakati angka rp 2 juta
7724218 bagimana tidak bila pln sering mati mereka tidak mau bertanggungjawab jika kami telat bayar kami bayar denda sekarang dua bulan belum bayar mau diputus langsung ini tidak adil padahal mereka sering salah mencatat meteran yang merugikan kami
7724219 coba anda hitung berapa keuntungan pln dari selisih harga yang kami bayar pln kan tidak pernah mengembalikan selisih yang berjumlah rp 49 rupiah

7724254 our target date for volume production was 2012 but in order to move that up weve decided to invest an additional us 14 million said tanaka bringing total investment to some us 70m through 2010 he noted that the production ramp should be eased because part of the new process is very similar to that already used in sanyos mainstay heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer hit cells which sandwich a single crystal silicon substrate between layers of amorphous silicon thin films
7724255 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
7724256 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
7724257 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd
7724258 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
7724259 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
7724260 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
7724261 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
7724262 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
7724263 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin
7724264 t he entire spirit of capitalist production which is oriented towards the most immediate monetary profits stands in contradiction to agriculture which has to concern itself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the chain of human generations
7724265 hardins fable was taken up by the gathering forces of neo liberal reaction in the 1970s and his essay became the scientific foundation of world bank and imf policies viz enclosure of commons and privatisation of public property the message is clear we must never treat the earth as a common treasury we must be ruthless and greedy or else we will perish
7724266 t hese large amounts of land with their attendant natural resources will never yield their maximum benefit to canadas native people as long as they are held as collective property subject to political management collective property is the path of poverty and private property is the path of prosperity
7724267 develop approaches to support the development of individual property ownership on reserves
7724268 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7724279 the medical needs here are the same as ours in america but they are also different
7724280 patients in america can be treated for small problems right away through self medication but here they dont have that option
7724281 a simple antibiotic mixed with a proper diet would cure it within days normally but because of the lack of treatment and nutrition it will take them much longer to heal
7724282 we look for sites that could be potential breeding grounds for disease and bacteria
7724283 were looking at standing water and testing it to see if mosquitoes are in there in some of these sites weve found minnows that will pull the mosquito population down
7724284 we want to eliminate sites that will continue to gather standing water this is where mosquitoes breed best
7724285 we want to help them with control of insects and give them advice on what to do
7724286 there are certain areas that are high risk in terms of exposure to infectious agents
7724287 by speaking with the citizens im able to make suggestions and offer advice for change
7724288 there could be metals like mercury and other things that could contaminate the water
7724289 we dont know the exact situation but there could be a potential waste sewage and water supply problem
7724290 what we try to do is arrive on scene ahead of the medcap crews and assess the area for potential insect build up
7724291 we will then spray down the area of the medcap hopefully before they arrive so it wont be of any inconvenience to them
7724292 the first step for anyone participating pier side at any of the medcap or encap sites is the spraying of your clothes
7724293 we use the insect repellent permetrin to spray on service members clothing while also recommending they keep their sleeves rolled down once you treat the uniform with spray you are pretty much set for the cruise
7724294 i was one of the first guys of my unit to have my uniforms sprayed
7724295 i would have to honestly say that it has greatly reduced my chances of being bit but i still get a couple here and there

7724297 pacific partnership is a five month voyage of peace and good will

7724301 mercys visit to fsm is a dramatic opportunity for the u s to reach out to the people of fsm
7724302 the mercys visit highlights americas commitment to peace and stability throughout asia pacific
7724303 the degree of understanding between us no matter how small will go a long way to bettering our relationship
7724304 this visit connects people from chuuk and the united states
7724305 pacific partnership reminds everyone everywhere around the globe that we are dependent on other people
7724306 we will forever be grateful to be a part of this monumental occasion
7724307 rear admiral hayes is a shining example of how our military is working to support diversity and fight the global war on terror
7724308 none of us in big could do what we do without the support and sacrifices from those who go into harms way to protect our freedoms
7724309 this award is not about me or anything i have done but it is about this incredible organization
7724310 since 1975 big has provided leadership for african americans in the service of this great country at all levels of government
7724311 this report underscores what i think we have known for a very long time that there is no place else in the country for a more dynamic mutually supportive civilian military relationship than what we all enjoy here in san diego
7724312 more naval forces are coming to san diego to take advantage of the many benefits here including the uss carl vinson cvn 70 in 2010 the mine and countermeasure forces and the first of the navys littoral combat ships
7724313 it is strategically important to our national security with its deep water port and access to area training ranges the san diego area is home to the largest concentration of military in the world
7724314 for over 100 years the navy and the san diego community have worked together for a mutual benefit this report bears testimony to the close relationship one we can look forward to nurturing and maintaining in perpetuity
7724315 this event is quite significant because the school honors an american hero who quietly served his country for 40 years
7724316 he opened the door and inspired a generation of african american flag officers many of whom are on active duty today
7724317 its pretty cool because my dad was in the navy a few years ago and so its pretty cool to see some navy guys like him
7724318 the last time he ever spoke to any group at all was to an elementary school
7724319 so i think it is very fitting that his name is on an elementary school
7724320 but a seadog in the navy is an old sailor who loves to go to sea and that is why we chose the name
7724321 his leadership by example and motivation given to frcsw sailors generated 257 volunteers who provided 1 395 hours of service to different communities throughout san diego in 2007
7724322 chief balingits sustained superior performance and the countless community service hours he has dedicated throughout his entire navy career have significantly contributed to sailor quality of life increased mission readiness and the overall success of our command and the nation
7724323 the steep canyon walls and 150 foot trees made it a bit more difficult to locate a safe place to put down the hoist located on the right side of the aircraft for the litter
7724324 the chamber seeks to build relationships between the military and the business communities this program was started more than eight years ago by the norfolk division armed forces committee in an effort by the business community to say thank you to those who have answered the call to serve in our nations armed forces
7724325 to those of you in the community that think about the military to put on an event like this i would like to thank you
7724326 words can not express how much we as service members appreciate this type of recognition
7724327 it is nice to know that the people in the community really do appreciate what we do as part of the military
7724328 it is an honor to be here and to be recognized for my accomplishments
7724329 every detail of our job will be scrutinized and based on the overall dining experience customer satisfaction quality of service safety sanitation financial and administrative capabilities
7724330 everyone has to be synchronized focused and motivated to want that title of best of the best every food service sailor has a role in this from the most junior food service attendant to the most senior culinary specialist
7724331 our chances of winning the ney award are incredibly strong
7724332 i am extremely confident that peleliu will win because of two things the food service team and the crew that supports this team
7724333 the peleliu team has proven that they are second to none in maintaining and repairing the food service equipment and are first rate at maintaining the cleanliness of the spaces
7724334 it is a great honor to be blessed with such a talented team
7724335 we believe that we are the most important team in helping build crew morale imagine waking up in the morning without a cup of freshly brewed coffee or a hot meal after long hours of hard work in the flight deck or down in the pit
7724336 i am seeing improvements visually around here your new sidewalks the gym thats going to be built the bachelors quarters the visiting quarters the gateway inn
7724337 i think its a direct result of the superb leadership that is evident here in guam
7724338 houses were built with comfort safety and convenience for the sailors and their families
7724339 we understand that sailors can be deployed for three six nine months at a time and we want them to know their family is cared for we strive to provide quality housing that is expected throughout the navy
7724340 the way you go about that is a strategic plan the navy ashore vision 2035 nav2035
7724341 and all that means is we are building now in 2008 the stair steps that will lead to 2035 and along that journey how are we improving every year the quality of our buildings and the quality of our extracurricular activities for our sailors and their families
7724342 in order to become one of those top 50 you have to stop talking about it and start producing results where the sailors and their families are seeing it and they say wow i want to be a part of this organization or i want to re enlist
7724343 what were trying to do is take the standards that have been tried and true proven from this private sector whose goal is to make money and apply it to the navy where our goal is mission readiness
7724344 we dont need all this excess and the reason is simple were throwing money out with bad infrastructure that we dont need to maintain anymore were on a very aggressive trend right now to identify what needs to be demolished and get the people out of there and into better buildings
7724345 well have the adequate resources then to support what were going to keep and not using those resources supporting stuff that we dont need anymore
7724346 our mandate is the support of the fleet the fighter and the family
7724347 so as we continue to improve the mission that means the piers get refurbished here the buildings that support the operators are in such a good condition that it allows for the people to be housed properly in order to execute the mission
7724348 getting the navy involved in the community and putting an event like this together is a real accomplishment
7724349 we strive in the navy to try and cultivate a culture of fitness and having a public event like this really drives it home for a lot of people
7724350 amd is executing a strategic plan to transform the company becoming leaner and more focused while seeking to create a business model to deliver sustainable profitability

7724369 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7724370 it is so wonderful to be here he said after arriving earlier in the day and sporting some hair loss in his trademark silver mane
7724371 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight he said pledging too that
7724372 for me this is a season of hope he said saying his dream was justice for many not a few and that
7724373 break the deadlock in america and finally be able to introduce a universal a health care system he added something that kennedy has been championing ever since he has been in politics including his own unsuccessful tilt at the white house when he ran for the democratic ticket against jimmy carter in 1980
7724374 young americans in uniform must not be committed to a mistake but a mission worthy of their bravery
7724375 he didnt say it would be too hard to get there
7724376 while the aim was not necessarily to do business i think the casualness and the lack of pretense made us all really close
7724377 it was a bunch of teenagers who were better than us calling us names
7724378 its that couch experience chatting around the game is as much fun as the game itself
7724379 its about getting yourself in front of someone so theyll remember you and find some point of connection
7724380 its a great arena to meet people i wouldnt have otherwise
7724381 this has got to be in the top five national security priorities
7724382 record reflects the careful balance between protecting the essential elements of the internet and securing the internet as a safe tool of commerce education and entertainment for our citizens
7724383 many pundits on the right are underestimating the ease with which barack obama has it within his power to get a 3 8 bump in support in the polls
7724384 we did not feel like it was a safe situation
7724385 the big part of what we taught over the summer is that theyre one unit
7724386 as much as we throw the football were expecting everyone to contribute
7724387 they understand that they know theyre going to get a chance to play and contribute were going to need everyone to contribute to be successful
7724388 as much as we throw the football were expecting everyone to contribute they understand that they know theyre going to get a chance to play and contribute
7724389 i really like a lot of the stuff he does adjusting to different teams
7724390 these are usually put up with grants but theres no money to take them down so there they stand weve got to have something to be able to take them down when theyre done
7724391 if people want to feel good about having some electricity come from the wind were shutting the door on that we should not just say no but look at it small quiet ones are now available
7724392 you miss an assignment miss a block or make a bad read youre out there doing tootsie rolls
7724393 at that level its the little things that kill you everyone at that level is great
7724394 they base your level on your ability to get things done the guys who do are making the big money the guys making a ton of mistakes are out of the league or working somewhere else
7724395 i saw all the work that went into it the little things that most people figure wouldnt be important its very important
7724396 at the highest level the small things are what will make a difference in the game
7724397 everyone has got to be very precise for us to be able to execute
7724398 we found no evidence that indicates that these practices were followed by anyone else involved with the circulation of these petitions
7724399 were saddened by it but were not going to be distracted by it
7724400 overall for the year we are up just under five percent so we are seeing a decent increase over last year and if you look at the state it is up seat wise five percent and doing very strong
7724401 our jet bridges are pointed upwards to go to larger aircraft as you go smaller we can only go so far they put a different cross member in that holds the jet bridge up that allows us to go 8 to 10 inches lower
7724402 the pitcher i played with for eight years and we won the national title together and the sponsor was one of the bigger sponsors that when i went to go play took me under his wing and made me and my family feel at home it was really easy to go play and probably wont have played that long if i would not have had people like that around me
7724403 its about being able to participate get out there have a good time just have a lot of fun and weve got buddies that come out and help the kids and i think they go away with a feeling of compassion and a sense of being able to help somebody else and they realize how fortunate they are that they are able to do the things that they are able to do and they want to come back and do it again so i think they get a real good feeling out of it too
7724404 honouring american values a belief in personal responsibility in community in hard work
7724405 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect

7724407 i have come here to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and elect barack obama president of the united states
7724408 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7724409 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them most
7724410 this is not going to generate a lot of income for us
7724411 so many of our riders are feeling the hit of the economy and this is going to be another hit for them
7724412 we dont know if the demand will exceed the supply
7724413 we were stunned we laughed we saw into the future and it was filled with hope
7724414 we take their hands and walk them down the surgical floor and we hope for the best

7724439 not for conducting as such but to improve intelligence to help our troops better understand the environment they find themselves in
7724440 i started out here the first year i got a wildcard into the main draw and i had played in the juniors before thinking that i was way out of my league and that i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds and that i cant believe the usta let me have a wildcard and ill never forget this day to you know obviously becoming a champion of it to then becoming a player with really good results and now coming back as a mom and as a former no 1 and the champion i mean its just all overwhelming ive always said that i never thought when i was growing up and playing that i would ever be in a champion like position so to look back i mean to go back year by year i mean i changed so much each year and it was such a learning process for me to get to the point in 98 where i actually thought i could win when i did prevail took a lot of years to get there

7724447 winning this award would be a great honor and carry on a nice john force racing tradition
7724448 a lot of people ask what our expectation levels are
7724449 we had very high expectation levels when we started this program getting into the top 10 was our goal when we step back and look where we came from we had nothing on november 1 when they ask how would you characterize your season i would say from scrap
7724450 the determination by our crew jon oberhofer nicky boninfante and our entire kalitta motorsports team to get our mac tools dragster running well this season is relentless
7724451 there are a lot of things riding on running our best in indy staying in the top 10 representing our sponsor the best we can at their race and just the fact that its indy its the biggest race of the year and the wally that drivers want on their mantle
7724452 you cant discount everything that alan johnson has done with the u s army dragster theyve had a remarkable year but with the countdown to 1 in place it could be anyones game
7724453 to realise our goal of registering two million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are

7724469 these are facts of life in which the united states relationship with russia thank goodness for 16 years has worked steadily toward nonproliferation and toward reduction of threats to the u s not to georgia but to the u s now we have got to keep our eye on the ball this doesnt excuse brutal actions by the russians they took advantage of a situation in which we were far away but at the same time we need an agenda with russia even as we are discussing the agenda with georgia
7724470 my core economic theory is pragmatism figuring out what works
7724471 back in 1993 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
7724472 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth

7724483 all i said was that i loved her jason weve been together for a year and a half i think that its alright to admit at this point in our relationship

7724487 come on come on give me a second to explain when have i ever steered you wrong will answer that for me when have i ever steered you wrong
7724488 that time you told me to take my date to the zoo because you said that men who loved animals would be more attractive to women
7724489 will that plan blew up in your face because you played animal activist for an hour
7724490 youre the one who told me to love the animals in the first place
7724491 well you know that youre supposed to exercise common sense when taking anyones advice especially mine my scope on women is a god given gift my friend making my dating advice very potent whats more is that im the only one who can handle my own advice to the degree necessary to totally succeed with women im a dating machine
7724492 besides getting your date to like you was what we were aiming for but i definitely think that
7724493 and i dont want to try to point the blame because you wont admit that your advice sucks
7724494 why should i admit something is true when it obviously isnt
7724495 so you know what youve got to do now right

7724505 hey weve conquered our racial problems weve looked beyond race to elect the person we really want in the white house
7724506 all i ever really needed to know i learned in kindergarten
7724507 the economy and the stock market do better under democratic administrations
7724508 with so many of the same values the wife of the democratic candidate for president said tonight
7724509 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7724510 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do she said
7724511 that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7724512 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7724513 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig
7724514 at six foot six ive often felt like craig was looking down on me too literally
7724515 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7724516 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7724517 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college
7724518 so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
7724519 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7724520 and as our friendship grew and i learned more about barack he introduced me to the work hed done when he first moved to chicago after college
7724521 the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life
7724522 but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be
7724523 and isnt that the great american story its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7724524 it is because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when dr king lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation
7724525 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7724526 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
7724527 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7724528 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do
7724529 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
7724530 because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation
7724531 its what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for hard working families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
7724532 thats why hes running to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college
7724533 thats what barack obama will do as president of the united states of america hell achieve these goals the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7724534 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7724535 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7724536 it was strong enough to bring hope to those neighborhoods in chicago
7724537 and it was strong enough to bring hope to people who came out on a cold iowa night and became the first voices in this chorus for change thats been echoed by millions of americans from every corner of this nation
7724538 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7724539 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own
7724540 how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7724541 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work
7724542 the economy and the stock market do better under democratic administrations
7724543 we tried tax cuts for the rich we did everything big oil asked come on america
7724544 the economy and the stock market do better under democratic administrations
7724545 we wouldnt permit this type of conduct in connection with the sale of cars or washing machines it is simply unconscionable that it occurred with a critical medical device
7724546 we dont know right now because thats what goldman is doing
7724547 capital access is more restricted now in the film business than its been in a decade
7724548 because the film business is hit driven there is enormous risk when financing films and the current has lessened investors appetite for risk

7724567 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes whoever is thinking about the shorter term is closer to reality artificially extending the stay of u s troops would cause problems the americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them but it isnt
7724568 id love to give a speech in germany as president not as a candidate
7724569 its hard for me to understand sen mccains argument he mccain was telling me i was supposed to take this trip he suggested it thought it was a good idea
7724570 john mccain has visited every one of these countries post primary that i have he has given speeches in canada in colombia mexico so it doesnt strike me that weve done anything different than the mccain campaign has done which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president and commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies
7724571 i dont know where obama got the idea that i have visited these countries and given speeches there as a presidential candidate

7724575 these guys dick cheney et al dont understand what theyre getting into
7724576 what has disappointed me is there hasnt been this debate on the strategy on the policy a regional strategy and policy let alone an iraq policy were were debating the tactics the surge is a tactic in what context is the surge you can make an argument for a surge if you were going to withdraw to cover the withdrawal for example or to contain to reposition forces or to re engage in a different way and a stronger way and why we got caught up in the tactical debate in my mind is an indication that we dont understand what we want to do what should our middle east policy be what should our policy be in terms of iraq and and the war against the extremists out there or the conflict against extremists we seem to be strategically adrift in my view
7724577 mom you taught us that if you believe in something you are supposed to claim it work for it fight for it with all you have
7724578 when you think about the values that have shaped our lives our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up and making lemonade out of lemons
7724579 i want my first lady to be proud of and love america and americans
7724580 laura bush is the perfect role model for a first lady grace dignity honesty and pure of heart with a bit of spunk i cant see michelle obama filling her shoes
7724581 i am really impressed how she has taken those punches
7724582 she doesnt waver from criticism she stands on her own
7724583 wants to take an active legislative role but she will be very supportive
7724584 every first lady has a right to her own opinion
7724585 the first lady is not running anything shes not being elected

7724591 we really pretty much rely on sponsorships from corporations and organizations that can afford to help
7724592 i think as long they can keep it at level of good will at the convention its all right
7724593 all of apis activities fully comply with the law and any ethics rules
7724594 house freshman democrats played an important role in passing the new ethics rules
7724595 any freshman democrat who does participate in the reception should be treated by the public and the media as failing to comply with the language meaning purpose and spirit of the new house ethics rule
7724596 many of these events are invitation only created as a way for high level politicians to rub shoulders with lobbyists and others with an interest in what happens once they are elected

7724598 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7724599 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7724600 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7724601 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7724602 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7724603 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
7724604 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7724605 dont ever have kids it isnt worth it all they do is hold you back from what you could do with your life

7724615 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
7724616 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7724617 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

7724622 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
7724623 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7724624 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7724625 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7724626 it looks like one guy just made a remark trying to act important

7724647 im using the metrics of incontrovertible reality reduction of violence the defeat of al qaeda in iraq the defeat and disarming of the mahdi militia and the first strides of iraq toward democracy

7724650 yitzhak dadons the student td apparently well placed bullets interrupted a rampage
7724651 americas acquiescence to anti gun hysteria has led to one tragedy after another
7724652 this disastrous policy has given us nothing but broken hearts and body counts and its got to end the heroism of an armed israeli seminary student halfway across the world sends a message that we neednt submit to murder in victim disarmament zones thats why his actions are getting such short shrift from americas press its a story they are loathe to report because it affirms a philosophy of self reliance that they despise
7724653 in light of last thursdays tragedy we must conclude that our liberal feel good policy of no firearms on the niu campus was a tragic and stupid blunder on the part of our over educated but too stupid to get in out of the rain sociology department who concocted the policy
7724654 henceforth any individual licensed to carry a firearm by illinois state law may carry one anywhere on campus that they so desire it is our fervent wish that should they find themselves confronted by a situation such as occurred last thursday in cole hall that they will feel free to use deadly force to quickly eliminate the threat and protect their fellow students and faculty
7724655 he reached republican dominated springfield as a committed liberal yet he emerged as a leader while still in his 30s by developing a style former colleagues describe as methodical inclusive and pragmatic he cobbled together legislation with republicans and conservative democrats making overtures other progressive politicians might consider distasteful along the way he played an important role in drafting bipartisan ethics legislation and health care reform he overcame law enforcement objections to codify changes designed to curb racial profiling and to make capital punishment which he favors more equitable
7724656 historically i have been a strong believer in a womans right to choose with her doctor her pastor her family
7724657 and ive been consistent in saying you have to have a health exception on any significant restrictions or bans on abortions including late term abortions
7724658 it can be defined by physical health it can be defined by serious clinical mental health diseases
7724659 i have a bunch of friends who were state lobbyists the fact of the matter is i played poker with them so i dont think that lobbyists are evil
7724660 i just think theyve got an agenda and you got to be clear about that and not pretend that they dont
7724661 my argument is not that were perfect i suffer from the same original sin of all politicians which is weve got to raise money
7724662 but my argument has been and will continue to be that the disproportionate influence of lobbyists and special interest is a problem in washington and in state capitals
7724663 the argument is not that im pristine because im swimming in the same muddy water
7724664 the argument is that i know its muddy and i want to clean it up
7724665 i know i cant tell you that he loves you and have you believe me to you i look like a privileged educated girl who doesnt know anything about struggle but anything you take from this conversation tonight with me let it be a testimony of his love for you
7724666 is it true what the old man had said that everything evil begins with an forgotten longing
7724667 will i ever just have a week a day off that i can catch up and relax
7724668 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do
7724669 a political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent drive personal appeal and work ethic and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do and a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over regulates and over taxes the nations citizens corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do
7724670 the roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind
7724671 when the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious
7724672 i think universal health care is a core democratic value and a moral principle and im absolutely gonna do everything i can to achieve that
7724673 if you dont start with universal health care if you dont say everybodys going to be in the system well never get there
7724674 does he have a sense of humor that covers a multitude of sins
7724675 imagine a religious fundamentalist married to an agnostic one would have to pray that the fundamentalist doesnt open the bible and hit the page in which abraham is willing to obey god and slit his sons throat
7724676 dont marry a problem character thinking you will change him hes a heavy drinker or some other kind of addict but if he marries a good woman hell settle down people are the same after marriage as before only more so
7724677 after i regale a group with this talk the despairing cry goes up but youve eliminated everyone life is unfair
7724678 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7724679 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7724680 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7724681 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together

7724743 our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain
7724744 it is sobering to think that habeas hangs by a single vote in the supreme court of the united states a reminder that the composition of the court could depend on the outcome of this years presidential election the ruling is a major victory for civil liberties but a timely reminder of how fragile they are
7724745 if barack obama were to win the democratic nomination and the white house he would be among other things our first civil libertarian president
7724746 we will close guant namo we will restore habeas corpus we will have a president who will respect and obey the constitution

7724756 es fundamental porque marca la integralidad de la decisiones en la planeaci n y el desarrollo urbano de la gran guadalajara
7724757 es fundamental porque marca la integralidad de la decisiones en la planeaci n y el desarrollo urbano de la gran guadalajara nos va a permitir darle ordenamiento al desarrollo de la ciudad tambi n poner sobre la mesa de debate cosas que no hemos querido debatir como las reas verdes y la redensificaci n de nuestra ciudad partiendo del centro hist rico de guadalajara que hoy est abandonado
7724758 al principio hab a muchas dudas incluso nos dec an que si estar a listo en 2015 era dif cil pensar esto posible ahora el auditorio telmex se consolida gracias a la uni n de voluntades y gracias a un equipo que comenz a formarse un a o antes de que se llevara a cabo la primera funci n

7724761 cuidamos todo porque tenemos un serio compromiso sin embargo nos ha pasado s lo una vez con el ballet de espartaco porque el promotor nos cancel 24 horas antes y nos gener conflictos

7724763 the intense atmosphere of sad loneliness caused by his schuberts delicate state of health and his sentimental and professional disappointments
7724764 it is an interior journey that the celebrated austrian composer wrote in 1827 just one year before his premature death at the age of 31
7724765 when schubert brings a poetic text into his universe of sound he performs it through a melodic link that penetrates the soul with sweetness bringing the listener to feel his same nostalgic consummation the same call of that truth of the heart that goes beyond all rationality in this way a picture is born that speaks of genuine everyday life of nostalgia of introspection and of the future
7724766 the spontaneous and exuberant young schubert was successful in communicating to us here tonight as well what he lived and experienced he is worthy therefore of the universal acclaim that is given to this illustrious genius of music who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria
7724767 not to be overcome by fear paralysed by apprehension or held back by inertia
7724768 a further step forwards in the impulse of missionary zeal in the americas
7724769 that the lord may be each day better known loved followed and praised in these blessed lands
7724770 how to remain in his love without conforming to the dictates of this world
7724771 with gentleness and fortitude and with the love that the holy spirit has poured into our hearts
7724772 share this treasure with others for there is no greater riches than to enjoy the friendship of christ and to walk by his side
7724773 drink the life giving water that flows from the side of the redeemer
7724774 most important service we can render to our brothers and sisters
7724775 clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ who came into the world that we might have life and have it to the full cf john 10 10
7724776 the son of god the redeemer of mankind and the strong rock upon which we can establish our existence

7724778 will help us to aspire to holiness so that in each of the baptised the missionary may be awakened whom he bears within
7724779 the spirit of ecclesial communion that has moved acn to promote this initiative
7724780 that god may continue to bless this charity together with those who support it so generously in its signal work of collaboration in the evangelising work of the church
7724781 the best tradition of evangelisation which began with another picture namely the image of the mother of god in guadalupe mexico

7724787 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7724788 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7724789 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7724790 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7724791 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7724792 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7724793 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7724794 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7724795 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7724796 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party
7724797 there are two barbers in town one has a great haircut and one has a bas one who do you go to get your hair cut at
7724798 the one with the bad haircut because hes the one who cut the other barbers hair the one with the good cut
7724799 a lot of people express themselves the way they dress
7724800 she cant tell us what to wear and not wear
7724801 i will tell you right now if a girl sits down and that skirt comes up too high in our opinion and yes its our opinion then we will do something about it
7724802 so theyre asking students to practically change their wardrobes and everyones already bought their clothes said junior kandace kranenburg some people dont have the money to do it
7724803 in troubled times it was understood that country comes before party
7724804 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and traditions of my political party
7724805 but it is clear to all americans that something is akilter in our great republic in less than a decade americas political and economic standings in the world have been diminished
7724806 you know we iowans have a strong vibrant two party political system however we dont genuflect ideology
7724807 the portfolios of challenges passed on to the next president will be as daunting as any since the great depression or world war ii
7724808 little is riskier to the national interest than more of the same
7724809 america needs new ideas new energy a new generation of leadership
7724810 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its not 2004 and its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
7724811 its a bummer but i think we have a lot of practice dealing with this type of situation from last year
7724812 im a wily experienced veteran when it comes to losing quarterbacks
7724813 i could come out here and i can probably run around
7724814 its a blow to us a team but its not something we cant recover from
7724815 its not that the focus shifts to justin in terms of can he do it we know he can do it

7724818 explains new york it sounds like shes talking about a 90s drew barrymore movie and on that note would it come as a shock to anyone if we found out that sister patterson has never been kissed
7724819 she said this to a man seemingly carved from marble buddha too wasnt that all the proof of devotion that wed ever need
7724820 instead of just running around cuckoo and hit and miss
7724821 i wish to hell i knew i was going to a ranch then i wouldnt look like this

7724831 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7724832 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7724833 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7724834 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7724835 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7724836 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7724837 at the most basic material level no one group of workers ever benefits from particular forms of oppression
7724838 whenever capitalists can force a higher paid group of workers to compete with a lower paid group wages tend to drop the only beneficiaries are capitalists who earn bigger profits while ensuring the survival of the rule of the profit system
7724839 w henever capitalists can force a higher paid group of workers to compete with a lower paid group wages tend to drop
7724840 the question of womens leadership in peoples war in nepal

7724847 the new vehicle is to replace alvin which was the first submersible to illuminate the rusting hulk of the titanic and the first to carry scientists down to discover the bizarre ecosystems of tube worms and other strange creatures that thrive in icy darkness the united states used to have several submersibles tiny submarines that dive extraordinarily deep alvin is the only one left and after more than four decades of probing the seas depths it is to be retired its replacement costing some 50 million is to go deeper move faster stay down longer cut the dark better carry more scientific gear and maybe just maybe open a new era of exploration
7724848 alvin can transport a pilot and two scientists down 2 8 miles providing access to 62 percent of the dark seabed the new vehicle is expected to descend more than four miles opening 99 percent of the ocean floor to inquiry but the greater depth means that the vehicles personnel sphere and its many other systems will face added tons of crushing pressure
7724849 snicker some even wanted to vote on what questions were going to be asked tonight
7724850 i know can you just imagine buffy i mean its dreadful perfectly dreadful that these pissants these commoners would dare to address politicians thats our job

7724852 they would then get diversion a scheme for first offenders and the lesson would be learnt for the rest of their lives
7724853 the police said it was far too serious for diversion its gone far beyond what was intended
7724854 i am persuaded that young men setting out on their lives dont need convictions for such serious charges
7724855 african markets are not immune to the doldrums in global stock markets but have not performed as badly as emerging markets such as india and china

7724859 people who work the day shift kiss their kids goodnight and head out for the night shift without disappointment without regret that goodnight kiss a reminder of everything theyre working for
7724860 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country
7724861 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america

7724885 at the hospital when they came in and told me he was brain dead thats the hardest part i ever had to face
7724886 when we went in for the evaluation they told us colton needed to be transplanted a month ago
7724887 to see him die and everything go to waste that would have been losing everything
7724888 the way it is now somebody else will have a chance to just continue on and a part of him will always live
7724889 thats plain and simple if they wouldnt have made the choice to donate their sons liver our son wouldnt be with us today
7724890 we got one child maybe four more thats the way you got to look at it as long as our dna was a part of our son then its a part of somebody else so instead of losing a child we gained four kids we didnt lose
7724891 he loved it hell continue to play through this child
7724892 we dont know what his plans are and im happy for her i wish it had been different but we cant change that
7724893 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7724903 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7724904 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7724905 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7724910 i just saw the amazing transformations that one can do with the proper knowledge expertise and patience
7724911 i wanted to help others restore and gain back their precious memories they may have thought were beyond hope
7724912 a lot of people dont take the time or effort to capture moments and memories
7724913 but i feel that you have to take as many photos as you can to remember everything no matter how insignificant it may seem
7724914 one of the great social disasters of recent american history
7724915 there was a girl who let me borrow her hoop and i havent put it down since
7724916 once something is that big its almost inevitable it will come back
7724917 its funny to think i didnt even hula hoop as a little kid and now im 20 and making a living from hoop dance
7724918 a lot of people dont think they can dance or theyll say they dont have the right body type for it the hoop frees your body and that helps you start moving in ways you didnt think you could before
7724919 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path
7724920 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7724921 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar
7724922 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
7724923 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

7724925 ill take samanthas kim cattralls character body any day she looks fantastic but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
7724926 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
7724927 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
7724928 shes inspiring but shes not going to keep me going
7724929 while the pieces are beautifully crafted the museum store was also attracted to this group because of the diverse cross section of the community that it represents

7724934 time warner cable will not allow it it is just an absolute atrocity the amount of money theyre making off these cheap boxes i cant wait to find out how little they pay for them
7724935 if you switched to directv or dish you have to have a new box
7724936 if you switch to verizon fios or at amp ts u verse you have to have a new box it baffles me to no end why there are four companies competing with cable and nobody has ever complained that you have to have a settop box for them
7724937 the customer ought to have the option to either rent the box by the month forever or buy it outright

7724944 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7724945 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process
7724946 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
7724947 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
7724948 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop
7724949 i dont know the pressure per square inch but it surely took a real athlete to handle the kind of bows they used back then but thats the point this movie is going to feel real it makes a legend we all know feel historically relevant

7724958 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
7724959 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7724960 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7724961 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7724962 you are making the meralco case an exception to so many things you said you are aware of the judicial ethics and yet you think this is an exceptional situation you called your brother even if you are bordering into something that is downright illegal
7724963 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7724964 i have no more faith in umno because theres corruption and abuse of power
7724965 concerns about credit risks both in the united states and japan are still strong there are also worries about the global economic outlook
7724966 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7724967 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colors of the costume parade
7724968 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7724969 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7724970 i love the music and the dancing and im definitely going to come again next year
7724971 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade

7724989 if i am ever going to be a functioning human ever again
7724990 people dont use bicycles as a commute option because they dont feel safe on our roads
7724991 so the first of these three elements segregating the bike lane from the rest of traffic along key corridors in downtown is critical
7724992 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung places in the county as much as it is focusing on those locations that we know are key destinations for people
7724993 all those things they want to implement that would make it so much nicer
7724994 the way things are going with cars and gasoline prices human power is going to be a lot more prominent its part of the solution right
7724995 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes
7724996 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7724997 the cost will depend on how many corridors we identify and for how many miles
7724998 oooh baby i know how you spend night time wrapped like candy
7724999 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military

7725001 showed a six minute video of long sporting dreadlocks and a beard telling a canadian news reporter i think i was lied to by my president
7725002 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him
7725003 was against the law arguing that justified longs fleeing to canada the lone character witness called to speak for long was peter haney with the pikes peak justice and peace commission he had met the soldier three times while long was awaiting trial in the el paso county colo lockup
7725004 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
7725005 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7725006 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
7725007 about two dozen anti war supporters gathered around the courthouse at fort carson in colorado springs colo yesterday afternoon as a military judge handed down longs sentence
7725008 the applicant submits that if returned to the united states he will be court martialed for desertion and he will be incarcerated in a military prison where like stephen funk camilo mejia and kevin benderman he will suffer persecution and cruel and inhumane treatment
7725009 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described

7725012 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
7725013 the body of the martyr abbas ali hmoud will stay in the building until the iillers are captured
7725014 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
7725015 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7725016 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7725017 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7725018 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7725019 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7725020 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7725021 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7725022 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings
7725023 i just lost my brother but i pray to god to save my son
7725024 a multi national division baghdad soldier died of wounds aug 25 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital the soldier was shot by a small arms attack during a dismounted patrol in northern baghdad the soldier was quickly transported to the medical faciality but later succumbed to the wounds

7725037 this is americas convention and were using new technology this time like text messaging and google and youtube to really break down these walls to make this convention more open and interactive
7725038 with this new data the predicted fastest 100 meter time would probably go down a little bit
7725039 the record then was about 9 79 and the model predicted these crazy times that by 2009 itd be down in the high 9 6s
7725040 i thought thats crazy its not going to progress that fast every day that i think about that i kick myself thats my penitence for doubting the numbers
7725041 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
7725042 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
7725043 typically when you get someone that big they cant start
7725044 we dont really know what the best form is and maybe bolt is redefining that and showing us we missed something
7725045 the limits will be largely set by the rules of the ioc
7725046 its kind of an arms race with the regulators of the sport and the people trying to push the technology to the limits at some point here there must be a d tente where technology cant push us any further and the rules will restrict it

7725087 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
7725088 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was

7725094 one is 21 second one 13 of course i have to worry
7725095 what concerns me is that when we have a suspect who enters a house like this who appears to be doing this for sexual gratification each encounter becomes more and more intrusive and potentially more violent

7725142 se trata de un proyecto ambicioso y de mucha envergadura cuyo fin principal es mejorar el ecosistema h medo as como poner valor a la zona y crear nuevas posibilidades de puestos de trabajo mediante el turismo ambiental
7725143 todos los implicados obtengan y se vean beneficiados con la actuaci n
7725144 los ten amos medio enga ados para que no pasara nada ellos estaban en la cubierta inferior excepto las dos mujeres y un chico que despu s parec a que era quien mandaba a todos ellos estaban con nosotros en el puente de mando en un principio cuando nos o an hablar y preguntaban les dec amos que est bamos manteniendo conversaciones con espa a pero finalmente fueron los que se dieron cuenta de que bamos a libia y pretend an ir a cont rselo a los otros primero tuvimos que impedir que bajaran pero el resto de los inmigrantes acabaron enter ndose y se pusieron muy nerviosos
7725145 tuve miedo porque les cre capaces de hacerme cualquier cosa en alg n momento quisieron subir al puente de mando y estaban muy nerviosos son gente que lo tienen todo perdido
7725146 y obligarnos a ir a espa a o bien matarnos
7725147 encima que les salvas la vida te lo pagan de esa manera
7725148 tengo que hacerlo si nos pasa otra vez tendremos que hacer lo mismo pero intentaremos no cometer los mismos errores
7725149 ah abajo se pod an atrincherar que fue lo que hicieron
7725150 nosotros sab amos que no eran inflamables porque son las que se usan para los compresores del t nel de congelaci n pero ten amos miedo ya que desde donde estaban ten an pleno acceso a la sala de m quinas y all est n los tanques de gasoil al final la polic a libia les hizo ceder
7725151 no quer an quedarse en libia quiz porque ellos salen de frica y no quieren volver
7725152 se pegaron a la proa pero no pod a cogerles porque a n ten a que dar el aviso
7725153 me contestaron de lampedusa y me pidieron que les dijera la situaci n y todos los detalles de c mo era la embarcaci n que llevaban y en qu situaci n estaban pens que se har an cargo y que lo estaban resolviendo pero a las cinco de la tarde me llamaron por radio para decirme que no era jurisdicci n ni de malta ni de italia
7725154 les puse a todos en proa les dimos agua y por la noche algo de cenar estaban en mal estado y por la noche un helic ptero tuvo que llevarse a dos uno de ellos ya no reaccionaba al subir al barco y ten a los ojos en blanco el otro ten a la barriga muy hinchada y orinaba sangre
7725155 en vacaciones la gente se despreocupa y se relaja pero cuando hay que retomar la actividad y enfrentarse de nuevo a las tareas llega el baj n
7725156 cada vez hay m s casos en las consultas porque en la actualidad vivimos con m s estr s pero van unidos a depresi n o ansiedad en las que intervienen otras causas como los problemas con la pareja
7725157 tomarse con calma la vuelta regresar de un viaje d as antes de empezar a trabajar y realizar actividades de ocio para que el cambio no sea tan brusco
7725158 se note m s en elche que el sector del calzado est de nuevo activo no obstante hoy por ayer se han incorporado al trabajo en torno a un 50 por ciento de las empresas
7725159 se nota especialmente en el volumen de tr fico de veh culos hacia los pol gonos industriales y todav a no es significativo hay que tener en cuenta que por vez primera la mayor a de las empresas ha dado vacaciones hasta septiembre porque hay poca actividad
7725160 no se le est dando una atenci n adecuada el problema es grave porque cuando un enfermo mental se encuentra mal los psiquiatras no pueden atenderlo y llegan a entrar en crisis agudas que podr an evitarse
7725161 la mayor a de las veces con un aumento de medicaci n se puede evitar pero si esa atenci n se demora la crisis es cada vez m s aguda
7725162 esto no es culpa de los psiquiatras ellos hacen todo lo que pueden le ponen mucha voluntad pero la responsabilidad es de la administraci n que no dota a este rea de personal suficiente
7725163 nos interesa que abran una zona en la que los enfermos puedan ser tratados no tendr amos que desplazarnos a santa faz todo depende del personal y los medios que aporten
7725164 el inmediato cese de fabra quien atenta e insulta a las instituciones democr ticas
7725165 camps debe tomar cartas en el asunto o ser c mplice de quien denigra a la democracia con sus comportamientos e insultos
7725166 fabra ha demostrado que ni tiene educaci n ni comportamiento c vico y nicamente se rige por sus principios del esp ritu nacional franquista
7725167 vuelva a las aulas a cursar la asignatura de ciudadan a para ver si aprende lo que es la convivencia y el respeto democr tico y el respeto a la ley
7725168 fabra no ha contestado a colomer pese a tener 38 asesores porque s lo sabe insultar y dilapidar el dinero de los ciudadanos porque no tiene dignidad
7725169 recuerda a otros tiempos y si ste es el modelo de camps que lo diga porque l es el responsable de su partido
7725170 resulta incre ble que rajoy defendiera este verano la honorabilidad de fabra cuando est imputado por delito fiscal y que en cualquier sistema democr tico hace tiempo que habr a cesado
7725171 los insultos de fabra y su permanente burla a la justicia y la democracia sta es la gota que ha colmado todas nuestras paciencias y exigimos a camps que cese a fabra o que asuma su responsabilidad en la connivencia con un imputado al que protege y da cobertura pol tica en el pp
7725172 la actitud dial ctica constante del grupo popular en la diputaci n
7725173 las respuestas de carlos fabra y los portavoces son un ataque continuo y permanente a los portavoces socialistas
7725174 se descalifica a los miembros de su partido sin argumentos y despu s las preguntas que formulan las contestan por escrito
7725175 como alicante no va a tener todav a servicios de guardia para los malos tratos lo que el consejo ha resuelto es potenciar la colaboraci n entre estos rganos judiciales

7725228 im stupefied by john mccains attitude in comparing barack obama to paris hilton a feat that hilton has already responded to with a video that is as inevitably burlesque and as it is vacuous and which has proven a great success among the weak minded masses in the archaic mind of john mccain calling his opponent a celebrity will bring him disrepute poor mccain in the 21st century it is disreputable not to be one
7725229 no somethings missing today i need a different special kind of tea thats not here
7725230 hey what oolongs have you got hiding there that arent on the mailing list yet

7725235 he has been a passionate force for good in this country for many years he also happens to be somebody i love to death
7725236 ted kennedy is the heart and soul of our party and hes inseparable from our fighting faith
7725237 think about it there hasnt been a single significant policy accomplishment over four decades without teds fingerprints and no one appreciates that more than the party faithful here in denver
7725238 uncle teddy who never missed a reunion a graduation or a chance to walk one of his nieces down the aisle

7725241 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter its for our nation that he should be on the frontbench
7725242 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such so that we dont hold up a false hope that he may come back because it makes a bit of a fool of me and a few others as well
7725243 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me
7725244 mengapa perlu tergesa gesa kita tidak boleh membuat andaian bahawa orang yang menang pilihan raya itu akan terburu buru datang dan berbahas dengan speaker dan angkat sumpah
7725245 mana tahu dia mahu pergi holiday kah pergi umrah kah
7725246 ada sebulan lebih untuk sesiapa yang menang untuk kita tetapkan bila angkat sumpah supaya ahli parlimen berkenaan boleh mengambil bahagian dalam perbahasan bajet tetapi saya sudah bersiap sedia untuk segala galanya

7725250 i have ideas other than metal gear and i want to go on to make other new games but for political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return
7725251 i would like to pass on the metal gear series to younger staff members and then go on to produce the title and not be so attached to it
7725252 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7725253 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7725254 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7725255 its not just about health its also about dignity eye contact
7725256 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7725257 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7725258 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it

7725269 speech involves rationalising our feelings and impulses something film directors of the silent period discovered they could catch at first hand
7725270 they found that the camera can uniquely photograph thought actions and images speak faster and more to the senses than speech does
7725271 a silent gesture can convey more in a flash than a minute of spoken dialogue unlike most actors who resist directors cutting their lines i have spent my whole career filleting mine there are few directors who have not seen my cuts as improvements steven spielberg paid me the ultimate compliment on indiana jones and the last crusade by adopting nine out of ten of my ideas that traded dialogue for added visual interaction

7725273 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer
7725274 as mentioned in our previous e mail we are launching new satellites to increase the number of hd channels that we are able to offer it is possible that pbs hd may become available at that time however i wouldnt want to speculate on any dates for this or our service provided by other companies

7725281 the equipment that is being provided is a testament to the importance of k9s in all our lives the noble service of k9s in law enforcement and the legacy of onyx and breezy
7725282 as a society we have an obligation to support and provide for animals
7725283 together with their human handlers law enforcement has been greatly enhanced by police dogs in narcotic seizures arson investigations explosives detections and patrol work
7725284 you dont always know if a suspect has a weapon
7725285 im a dog lover and my husband justin shirley works at the sheriffs department
7725286 im laid off from visteon so i figured i had the time to do this
7725287 he loves being petted and i dont know how many kids came up and hugged him
7725288 he goes on calls when we are serving search warrants and he has pursued them when somebody runs
7725289 people give up for the dog a lot quicker than for me they know they cant outrun the dog
7725290 if he does get hurt a vest might keep him from getting hurt or lessen the wound
7725291 the use of dogs trained to sniff out narcotics and explosives has proven its value time and again
7725292 resulting in arrests of drug dealers confiscation of illegal weapons and cash from illegal transactions
7725293 the use of our dog played a central role in the arrests and in getting the illegal drugs off the street
7725294 he failed as well to fulfill his pledge to create a narcotics team a dive team and a bomb squad
7725295 he eliminated supplemental sheriffs officers patrols in the western part of the county in 1994 and was 20 years late in installing stolen motor vehicle detection devices in departmental vehicles
7725296 mcgettigans tenure in office has been marked by one broken promise after another continuing failures to take advantage of technological advances to fight crime and an inability to deploy personnel effectively
7725297 the taxpayers and citizens of atlantic county have been ill served by mcgettigan
7725298 for their tax dollars they deserve a modern up to date crime fighting agency which places the safety and security of the public not political advantage above all else

7725307 had exhausted all of the other parliamentary tools at our disposal
7725308 the actions of the parliamentarians that made false promises to the evacuees and in so doing delayed the process
7725309 we have no choice but to establish this probe because the government has proved to be obtuse and has disseminated lies regarding aid to evacuees
7725310 if we reach together with the evacuees an understanding that it is more important to ask what the state needs to do to find solutions to evacuees problems than to delve into the history and come up with personal conclusions about who is responsible the commission will complete its work more quickly
7725311 it is important to me to reveal all of the bad intentions and neglect on the part of people in the government but it is even more important to find solutions to the evacuees problems than to make political hay
7725312 we made mistakes if you ask if today we would have done it better yes we would have
7725313 these people have gone through a very hard process we are doing our utmost to show them that we are here for them we are working day and night for them

7725322 anche il presbitero quando celebra leucaristia deve servire dio e il popolo con dignit e umilt e nel modo di comportarsi e di pronunziare le parole divine deve far percepire ai fedeli la presenza viva di cristo
7725323 questo sacrificio poi come la stessa passione di cristo sebbene sia offerto per tutti
7725324 la fede condizione della partecipazione al sacrificio di cristo con tutto me stesso
7725325 il signore riceva dalle tue mani questo sacrificio a lode e gloria del suo nome per il bene nostro e di tutta la sua santa chiesa
7725326 devotamente e con fede i misteri di cristo a lode di dio e santificazione del popolo cristiano secondo la tradizione della chiesa
7725327 troppo grande il mistero delleucaristia perch qualcuno possa permettersi di trattarlo con arbitrio personale che non ne rispetterebbe il carattere sacro e la dimensione universale
7725328 l ars celebrandi scaturisce dallobbedienza fedele alle norme liturgiche nella loro completezza poich proprio questo modo di celebrare ad assicurare da duemila anni la vita di fede di tutti i credenti
7725329 unautentica azione liturgica esprime la sacralit del mistero eucaristico questa dovrebbe trasparire nelle parole e nelle azioni del sacerdote celebrante mentre egli intercede presso dio padre sia con i fedeli sia per loro

7725338 the aussie has a good reason to be down here mr milton said
7725339 theres not a lot of positive news out there for the aussie at the moment not enough to counter this down move
7725340 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market mr heffernan said
7725341 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over 1 to 1 5 per cent
7725342 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year mr heffernan said
7725343 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so

7725359 olson is part of the american dream the dream of expansionism in all its variations it is in order to understand this empire that ive written this book im not interested in olson himself but rather his condition as a micro analogy in order to descipher the empires psychopoetics

7725425 like its predecessors the f50fd is capable of reaching iso levels higher than most other comparable compacts this camera will reach levels up to iso 1600 at the full 12 mp you can take it a step further and go up to iso 3200 but the resolution will fall to 6 mp finally you can take this camera to a ground breaking level of iso 6400 but the resolution again drops to 3 mp at the highest iso levels you can still manage to get usable small prints with minimal image noise the experts seem to agree that while the f50fd does produce solid photos its performance isnt quite up to its predecessors standards in both performance and image quality
7725426 with an increase in megapixels you do get better detail but you also get an increase in digital noise particularly at iso 400 and above images have colors that are natural looking in fact most people who are used to other cameras doing a lot of massaging with the color may be taken off guard with thef50fds colors since they look remarkably normal one particular irritating things was the slick body finish while it looks really cool it does not provide descent gripping
7725427 image quality is simply outstanding right on exposures peppy performance and outstanding resolution make this camera capable of producing some of best images the reviewer had ever seen now the problem the beautiful images stop if you move past iso 200 pictures taken above iso 200 deteriorate because of excessive pixel density in camera noise reduction is very aggressive resulting in photos that appear grainy and soft bottom line if you can stay below iso 200 this is one sweet little camera
7725428 it took the reviewer 3 different f50s until he could find one that produced sharp images which does not speak very highly of fujifilms quality control the camera has some nice features but picture quality is a little unpredictable generally colors are good but detail around the edges of pictures tends to be a bit blurry bottom line this is not a bad camera but there are better choices out there
7725429 if you take into consideration the price and feature set this is a pretty tough camera to beat as a carry around point and shoot the camera would probably fit the bill but just because it packs 12 megapixels does not mean youll end up with consistent high quality photos as would be expected high iso shots have digital noise and the camera tends to go into slow mode when saving large multiple files
7725430 while the f50fd is by no means a bad camera and indeed it performs as well as any of the other 12mp compacts on the market while undercutting most of them on price it has lost the low light high iso advantage of the f31fd and f40fd it is still a very well made and sensibly designed compact camera with some useful features and at low iso settings its image quality is very good but it doesnt stand out from the crowd
7725431 in spite of the minor flaws and the slightly pedestrian feature set despite the fact that fujifilm has actively narrowed the gap between its super ccd sensor and conventional ccd compacts by squeezing too many pixels in and despite the fact that there is little if any real benefit to the resolution hike the f50fd is still one of the better pocket cameras on the market
7725432 good image quality good design good price and a good set of features combine overall to make an excellent digital compact nuff said
7725433 this is an impressive camera small enough to fit into a pocket it can take a decent photo in most situations it is one of the best lowlight compact cameras around it also has a few extra features than a typical point and shoot camera
7725434 there were several changes to the features of the f50fd that make this camera very easy to use with manual aperture and shutter speed priority modes this model will allow the novice photographer to have as much fun with this camera as a beginner can with the fully automatic mode and 16 pre programmed shooting modes we feel this is a nice ultra compact that will please any user whether for home use or in an office the image quality wont disappoint when shooting indoors or out and with 12 megapixels you can create beautiful 13 19 inch or larger prints with a price tag of us 299 or less it offers a good value for a very capable consumer model
7725435 in our image quality tests the f50fd earned the highest mark in this group for having the least distortion and received very high marks for sharpness its flash is a bit weak so it didnt get high scores for its flash shots but overall it earned a rating of very good
7725436 overall the results are good and youll end up with fewer unusable images than on many competing cameras but when compared to the f31fd the advantages of the extra resolution are not always obvious as the increase in pixels seems to have brought with it a noticeable increase in image noise browsing your photos is also very quick and easy thanks to a micro thumbnail view which allows you to browse through 100 images on screen at a time
7725437 the f50fd doesnt quite edge it out although it comes at a competitive price and its combination of successfully implemented advanced automatic tools ergonomic design and satisfying shots makes it easy to recommend
7725438 the lab results and high iso image quality are disappointing weve come to expect great high iso images from the fujifilm f series and ultimately the f50fd falls shorter than our expectations in terms of image quality and thats what matters most wed really love to see fujifilm put these technological advances is face detection irsimple dual memory format in a replacement for the 6 megapixel f30 or f31fd to make the most of the f50fds feature set and the f30s image quality
7725439 ultimately the finepix f50fd is good but not remarkable it has a pedestrian 35 105mm optical range a screen and is system which are bettered by rivals and arguably doesnt match canon panasonic and sony for industrial design it is however a solid performer with effective indoor flash facilities reasonable manual control and represents good value considering its high 12 megapixel resolution as such we can recommend it but its not the f30 f31fd successor we were hoping for
7725440 this compact camera still has no rivals in terms of low light performance
7725441 the f50 remains an excellent camera but going to 12 megapixels weakened its lead the new high resolution sensor shows moderately higher image noise than the f31fds 6 megapixels sensor and the size of its output files had a detrimental effect on shot to shot speeds still the f50 produces high quality images above and beyond what is customarily seen among ultra compact digital cameras
7725442 the fujifilm f50fd is small light and easy to take anywhere its controls are well devised and identified making it easy to become familiar with the operation of the camera the monitor there is no optical viewfinder is sharp and has a high refresh rate yielding a smooth and fluid image but just as importantly the f50fd responds quickly to its controls including to the shutter release and to its menus
7725443 we want to love the f50fd but we cant give it our full recommendation yes its packed with lots of features at a great price but its noise and dynamic range performance are terrible and its colors arent anything to brag about either the resolution may be fantastic but the processing time is so annoying that its hard to enjoy much about this camera it takes too long to open up the playback mode scroll through pictures and write images after a 3 shot burst those logistical concerns coupled with the lackluster performance overpower the excellent resolution and great price
7725444 as long as you dont mind the between shot sluggishness or slight texture that the noise creates even at lower isos when viewed on a monitor then the fujifilm f50fd would make a nice choice for advanced photographers looking for a pocket camera to supplement an slr i say this not only because of the merits mentioned above but also because the cameras aperture and shutter priority modes give you up to 10 choices when choosing an aperture or shutter speed while a lot of compact cameras with those shooting modes limit you to significantly fewer choices sometimes as few as two
7725445 with an internal memory of only 25 mb we at least expected to find a memory card in the bundle the lack of one is a real black mark for the manufacturer the other basic accessories are all accounted for a usb cable for transferring your photos to a computer a charger for the removable battery and finally a video cable for viewing your photos and video on your tv set the included cd rom offers a driver and a photo management application which unfortunately does only that and nothing more
7725446 she criticized president george w bush and other republicans for presenting offshore drilling as an answer to the recent rise in u s gasoline prices saying expanded drilling would not affect prices for a decade and then only by a small degree i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7725447 domestic natural gas prices have already plunged 42 percent since early july an even faster drop in price than oil or most other commodities in part because the rapid supply growth has begun to influence the market price spikes remain possible of course but throughout the industry the shale discoveries are causing a shift in thinking about the long term outlook

7725474 the interior department has announced a plan that would dramatically undercut the endangered species act our nations safety net for animals and plants on the brink of extinction if finalized the plan would allow government agencies with no formal wildlife expertise to decide the fate of imperiled species like the polar bear the gray wolf and whales even worse those agencies may have a pro polluter or pro development agenda that is directly at odds with the well being of wildlife
7725475 the bush administrations new rules which could go into effect in as little as 90 days unless congress acts to block them also address a loose end left by the interior departments decision in may to list the polar bear as threatened the reason for listing the bears was climate change global warming is melting their sea ice habitat but the proposed changes to the esa would explicitly exempt any action on warming based on the law in other words even though scientific opinion says that global warming will have a disastrous effect on wildlife the government wont be able to use the esa to do anything about reducing carbon emissions climate change is not an american problem it is an american and worldwide problem if the esa and other regulations are weak in the worlds largest economy the whole world is in very deep trouble to use the clich adage when the us sneezes the whole world catches a cold the us would be setting a bad example and other especially industrialized nations which emit most greenhouse gases will follow suit

7725594 as far as were concerned this is the best time to launch our best truck ever
7725595 as we see competitors backing off a little bit its our opportunity to take some share with this brand new truck
7725596 id rather go to a gunfight with a really big gun and thats what we have here
7725597 they wont be competing with the launch of the f 150 anymore because thats delayed so i can see how thats beneficial to them
7725598 right now there isnt any advantage to anything because the market is so bad
7725599 i guess you need to take what you can get
7725600 we like the fact that ford delayed they could delay for another year as far as were concerned
7725601 that gives us a lot of opening from a brand perspective and marketing perspective to launch this car without being overlapped with ford marketing
7725602 the new truck is great our customers are really excited about it
7725603 whatever they want to do is independent to why were making our business decisions
7725604 f 150 has been a leader and we plan to remain a leader we think our timing is really going to work well for our business
7725605 its right in line with jim press plan of taking the old truck inventory down
7725606 i like the new ram i think the product is good
7725607 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7725608 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7725609 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7725610 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7725611 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7725612 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7725613 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7725614 when i see an adult on a bicycle i do not despair for the future of the human race
7725615 preocupa me o futuro porque l que vou passar o resto da minha vida
7725616 um dia eu vou morrer e tudo que restar de mim ser o links
7725617 if we ever needed a mild winter we need it now
7725618 the economy will be struggling to remain in positive territory
7725619 the added financial burden of heating our homes will make this the toughest winter since that of 2001 2002
7725620 not only are energy costs going through the roof but peoples incomes are going down
7725621 to grow to become better than who and what we are
7725622 no more hints put it right between my eyes on the wheres whens hows and whys and whos of me getting from here to where i need to be to matter
7725623 it was encouraging to see the quantity and quality of candidates who came forth to be considered for the council at large position
7725624 it was a very difficult decision because of the strength and character of the three individuals who were vying for the seat
7725625 for some reason grossi took it upon himself to kill him bai we dont know exactly why
7725626 i support the park department and i enjoy the resources of the county
7725627 im proud to represent our park department i was kind of confident but surprised too because there are a lot of great graphic artists out there
7725628 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7725629 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7725630 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7725631 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7725632 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7725633 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7725634 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7725635 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7725636 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7725637 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7725638 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7725639 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7725640 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7725641 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7725642 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7725643 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7725644 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7725645 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7725646 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7725647 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7725648 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7725649 just three percent of sites that are on the historic registry actually make it to landmark status so lets give a round of applause congratulations
7725650 they had such faith and patience and perseverance they are heros all of them
7725651 oh boy it just makes me so happy to see it happen
7725652 it will enjoy to to be out here sometime and taking people through and sharing with them our memories
7725653 and since b reactor nothing has been the same this machine changed the world and everyone one of us standing here today
7725654 theres so much this reactor has given so much history behind it
7725655 the time to build it design it its just outstanding its got to be saved for future people
7725656 expanding public access to a former nuclear site is no small task
7725657 the show is now joined by shilpa shetty she looked lovely as always and very trim she displayed mock anger at meeting me because i missed wishing her on her birthday horrible me
7725658 species that are invading and disrupting native plant communities in florida this definition does not rely on the economic severity or geographic range of the problem but on the documented ecological damage caused
7725659 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7725660 its been two weeks since weve had a match out here so it was nice to get back home
7725661 it always feels good when youve got familiar surroundings and you know the nooks and crannies of the course
7725662 i hit the ball real well until the last hole i hit a bad shot and it cost me
7725663 i had to play a punch shot and it went out of bounds
7725664 ive known coach mark czubik since he was a referee here locally
7725665 then about 1990 he told me that he was going to start a team at kalida
7725666 ever since then these games have been really tough i believe this is only about the fourth time we have won also there has been something like 10 games in this series that have ended 1 0 so for us to score two goals on them i was pleased
7725667 i thought in the first half they outhustled and outworked us
7725668 but give them credit they are well coached and theyre a very good team
7725669 but we had some opportunities i told them before the game that we might not get many opportunities but if we do we needed to capitalize on them
7725670 i wanted to substitute a lot in the second half but the biggest thing is getting out with any injuries
7725671 go check it out and start to think about whether or not youd like to contribute to next months matsuri which will be hosted by tae kim i know im in i just gotta find something coherent to write about
7725672 with the success theyve had theres no selfish guys on this team
7725673 its different than toronto everyone talks to everyone and when you come into a situation like that you have to feel good about it from the first time i walked into the locker room i was greeted its a different team and a different atmosphere
7725674 i had the opportunity to work with the first group on offence completed some throws and threw three touchdown passes its a good situation to be in but i know i have to go out and not press too much but getting this opportunity says a lot about the coaching staff and my new teammates
7725675 because of the injury situation we had to alter our offence
7725676 when we traded kerry joseph to toronto in march we felt wed have a good offensive line and a receiving corps equal to the better groups in the league but who couldve predicted losing half our offence to injury
7725677 so weve had to change our strategy and need an athletic quarterback to give us pass rush options and open things up for running back wes cates
7725678 any time you make a change of this magnitude with a person as highly respected as marcus theres going to be emotion
7725679 in the big picture you understand that players are people who wear jerseys for a living they have strong relationships and theres going to be a reaction
7725680 but we have a strong group and theyll bounce back and you could see that yesterday
7725681 from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7725682 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot on at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7725683 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7725684 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7725685 you know what i mean this was manly but correct he hit him but not in the balls
7725686 i was in bed asleep and my son was here and he was about to go to bed and he said he just felt the house shake and he didnt know what it was
7725687 a lady from over the corner she came in screaming and crying and would not let me go out the front because the car was right up at the window
7725688 i was more concerned about my dog who was on the bed with me
7725689 i have always had insurance but being on a pension i couldnt afford the high one
7725690 but the insurance company has told me im completely covered i am surprised at the damage im shocked fair enough the outside but not the bedrooms i was so close only a foot and a half from all the smashed windows
7725691 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7725692 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7725693 confident but not cocky a team player who improves the game of those around him and he will not back down
7725694 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7725695 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7725696 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7725697 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7725698 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7725699 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7725700 what it is is to get in there and fix these issues in the past it just hasnt happened
7725701 the committee also found a lack of knowledge within the community about the risks of treadmills to toddlers and therefore recommended an education program for parents
7725702 when you hear a report on the radio of no damage we normally get a couple of hundred claims the majority of the damage is inside properties
7725703 the building officers had a walk through town and there is no obvious sign of damage to buildings at all
7725704 when it happened we thought here we go but there was just nothing
7725705 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life
7725706 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7725707 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office
7725708 they took our pensions it wasnt right so were trying to find somebody to take their place to help us win the fight for the working people
7725709 india is looking for acceptable nsg exemption clean exemption with no additional conditions and the parameters have to be within the parameters of july 18 2005 understanding with the us
7725710 civil nuclear cooperation is important but that does not mean at any cost
7725711 civil nuclear cooperation is important and they may push india but india does not get pushed
7725712 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
7725713 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7725714 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7725715 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas
7725716 by raising the tax on our truckies fuel how that leads to lower grocery prices for working families is beyond me
7725717 well certainly be having a close look at that one in the senate
7725718 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7725719 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7725720 the next step is best for indexing your synth into live search
7725721 now the good stuff photosynth is awesome but now lets just get sick shall we i built the following application using a virtual earth map that highlights different properties on a map with pushpins once you hover over a pushpin youll see the synth in the enhanced rollover if you dont have photosynth installed it will prompt you to install it obviously this is a basic demo to show the code and demonstrate the technology but can you imagine the new real estate experience searching for homes you can actually see the property from every single angle in high resolution pseudo 3d

7725723 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7725724 the fundamentals for travel out of australia this year have been very strong weve got a strong australian dollar near full employment and comparatively cheap airfares

7725751 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely male driven you might argue that men have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the female century that its fair and its time
7725752 im surprised then that you understand the terms of the argument you claim to refute because if you were actually consistent you wouldnt accept its premises
7725753 al gore has a big house i hear and hes overweight
7725754 or maybe cultivating confusion and polarising the debate are the real motives
7725755 the only thing im willing to do about it is to put aluminium foil all over the place cause like im not going to completely upend the economic system and incidentally my quality of life for this thing
7725756 translation feminism has now achieved all its ends and can now fade away and of course there are no social or cultural differences in masculine and feminine behaviour yet youre not an anti feminist you say
7725757 gender analysis like race analysis is best understood as an inevitable if unpleasant ideological manifestation of an historical epoch that is race analysis coincided with the age of european imperialism in the same way that gender analysis now coincides with greater female equality
7725758 if anythings repeating a gendered set of assumptions that is you may not be conscious of that but your choice of words is anything but neutral
7725759 it would never occur to you to use it except as a provocation i suppose
7725760 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely male driven you might argue that men have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the female century that its fair and its time
7725761 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely negroid driven you might argue that negroids have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the aryan century that its fair and its time
7725762 it is intriguing that anti gay male homophobia has become acceptable within gender studies
7725763 when the only association is that you dont like feminists
7725764 doesnt it occur to these people to think that unless you say something coherent and intelligible you arent actually communicating
7725765 according to the nature of truth operations in the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth functions from truth functions arises a new one every truth operation creates from truth functions of elementary propositions another truth function of elementary propositions i e a proposition the result of every truth operation on the results of truth operations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truth operation on elementary propositions
7725766 thats why i think its interesting to consider climate change denialism as a gendered phenomenon
7725767 in utilizing and conserving the natural resources of the nation the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight the conservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our national life
7725768 steves welcome to disagree with me as are you but going off on some tangent of bashing everything in academia he doesnt like isnt making an argument
7725769 nowhere in the whole creation do i see beings that observe within their lives that moderation natures ruler wished them always to preserve have any done so not a one for better or for worse that never will be done
7725770 i will leave aside the chemistry and physics for now

7725774 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
7725775 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

7725880 we do a lot of business in denver we looked at these as opportunities to help these three cities pull off these events
7725881 the sheer magnitude of the dollars needed to support something like this you need to have corporate sponsors
7725882 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and products that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers thats why we contribute and participate
7725883 a lot of the same things that matter in politics matter in our business
7725884 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7725885 863 billion in new government programs a 23 percent increase in the size of government
7725886 by size of government we are referring to government spending outside of mandatory spending its the argument that outside of mandatory spending this is the most immediate way that will have an impact on government spending and when you include his spending proposals it accounts for a 23 percent increase

7725891 no quiero pensar en el tiempo ni en mi edad sino en hacer todo de la mejor manera para volver a jugar en febrero en el clausura y en la este momento por mi cabeza s lo pasa pensar en la recuperaci n
7725892 esta lesi n es m s grave que la anterior porque en 1999 en aquel partido contra col n s lo se le rompi el ligamento cruzado anterior pero confiamos en su recuperaci n ya que mart n ha dado muestras de una gran capacidad f sica y an mica

7725920 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7725921 he needs to talk about it now he needs to talk about it very specifically i think he will not only during the convention but in the campaign that follows
7725922 i will certainly be talking about the economy and some of the problems that exist and i will be comparing in a brief way what i perceive to be the mccain approach versus the obama approach
7725923 obama has never enjoyed the kind of privilege that sen mccain has enjoyed
7725924 sen mccain was the son of an admiral and has lived an affluent privileged life and continues to do so

7725930 we may disagree with some people or things we see on the news but its about freedom of speech
7725931 personally i guess the growth in internet penetration is one of the main reasons behind the growth in laptop sales the number of internet users in the arab world is in a continues growth for instance social networking users in arabia and africa grew up by 66 in 2008 so were are talking about millions of arabs are on social networking sites not to mention other internet services more reasons to be online
7725932 little girls in saudi arabia which i will use as an example from now on given that qatars population equals that of boston deserve to have strong heroes too
7725933 its old media meets new media its new media meet new media im just here to meet somebody
7725934 i just wonder if bloggers can have as much impact when they are in the same place as the big dogs
7725935 the bottom line is that people no longer want to be spectators technology allows us to essentially become participants
7725936 i just asked for free food free wifi and free beer
7725937 this time we have delegates uploading videos from the convention center
7725938 and in my own life in my own small way i have tried to give back to the country that has given me so much

7725940 losing it and gaining my life back one pound at a time

7725942 sebab jika anda memiliki kejujuran disiplin inovasi ketekunan dan kerja keras semuanya akan bisa terlaksana
7725943 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7725944 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7725945 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7725946 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
7725947 putting a fish in water with no oxygen is like buying a cat and then putting it underwater
7725948 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7725949 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7725950 protect these public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry
7725951 por qu no decretaron una prohibici n completa de fumar
7725952 todos los empleados tienen el derecho a trabajar en un ambiente libre de humo de tabaco ajeno
7725953 for the record i noticed you fixed your teeth for the record i didnt think they were crooked
7725954 id like to thank my colleagues on city council for their kind wishes and for filling in for me during my absence
7725955 i see myself with this limp boy clutched to me nearly lifeles his blood on my dress his hands tangled in my hair shocked i let him fall to the ground with a sickening thud i was truly a monster
7725956 honduras no tiene que pedirle permiso a nadie para adherirse al alba
7725957 hoy estamos aqu porque honduras necesita verdaderos cambios estructurales y en materia de progreso econ mico
7725958 cuando se dice alternativa bolivariana estamos diciendo al mismo tiempo alternativa martiana sandinista y morazanista porque todos ellos siguieron el camino de bol var
7725959 si amo el teatro musical es porque lola cort s me deslumbr con su talento cuando la vi en jos el so ador

7725961 in principle we need international concerted action to counter any act of illicit trade in tobacco product including counterfeit
7725962 there is need for more power to fight the illicit trade in tobacco and that is why we at wco want the protocol to begin
7725963 we need international law and a stronger mechanism to control the diversion of tobacco products prevent the smuggling and get at the underground manufacturing plants that we know exists
7725964 our mandate is to protect the health and safety of the people while ensuring a sustainable economy we are willing to work but the protocol will make our work easier it cannot wait
7725965 while there is a significant decline in the smoking rates in the developed world with diminishing health concerns in the developing world such as nigeria smoking increases at least by 20 annually
7725966 the case is a significant step in tobacco control campaign in africa
7725967 to recoup public money spent on treating tobacco related ailments as well as secure declarative judgments to protect our children from the tobacco industry
7725968 is the monster frame this that it was monstrous to fail to treat even born alive but not yet viable infants as human beings
7725969 today im not happy im not even gone try to pretend i am however i will remain joyful in times like these because the joy of the lord is my strength and i need strength right about now god said he would never leave me and knowing that brings joy to my heart forget the fact that i dont have a car or the fact that i could lose my job as long as i got jesus everythings going to be alright
7725970 if the countrys worse off isnt both the president and john mccain arent they both responsible
7725971 well look if you want to talk about history then you can make all the cases you want to make
7725972 but youre talking about history you talk about the last four years
7725973 exactly and what im talking about though right now is what the future holds and whos got a plan to cut taxes and get the economy moving again
7725974 current economic conditions or where we are in other places
7725975 provide immediate medical care for any child born alive as a result of the abortion
7725976 for more than 20 years illinois law has required that when there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb with or without artificial support an abortion may only be performed if a physician believes it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother
7725977 grant federal protection to newborns who are fully outside the mother regardless of their stage of development
7725978 the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
7725979 consistent with our position last year naral does not oppose passage of the born alive infants protection act last years committee and floor debate served to clarify the bills intent and assure us that it is not targeted at roe v wade or a womans right to choose
7725980 in response to the supreme court decision striking down nebraskas
7725981 the law appears to make a delineation between infants born alive who are viable and not viable there doesnt appear to be any care required of non viable infants born alive do you know if this was specifically what the infants born alive bill was changing was it extending care to non viable infants those who had no prognosis of survival
7725982 what duties are owed to a non viable child born alive
7725983 are these babies medical waste or persons protected by the constitution obamas reaction was to consider them non entities under roe v wade until they were viable even when they were gasping outside the mother
7725984 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7725985 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade
7725986 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
7725987 tim i have no trouble seeing why you would feel this way your premise here is one that the left and the right are just not going to agree on what seems compellingly obvious and true to you about this does not seem compelling at all to me
7725988 i filled a survey out on the internet and they asked who i was going to vote for and why i wrote that i was a hillary supporter and listed all the reasons why i thought she would make a good candidate i guess that email was sent to the clinton administration because i received an email back telling me hillary had chosen me to be one of her delegates from nc
7725989 i was truly disappointed when i found out i was an alternate delegate especially after leaving my husband at home i found out today i cannot even sit on the floor with the other delegates
7725990 if i had known i wouldnt be able to sit with the other delegates and gain that experience i would not have spent all this money to come here
7725991 viv amos dentro de una jaula de oro no nos faltaba nada ten amos todo
7725992 no es cuesti n de cinco meses eso es algo con lo que se nace y no se hace en estos cinco meses nos ayudaron a pulir muchas cosas pero definitivamente no se pueden fabricar artistas ni cantantes uno tiene que tener talento y aqu te ayudan a pulirlo como el desenvolvimiento la interpretaci n y la presencia en el escenario
7725993 pero no s lo eso sino que mi personalidad cambi pese a que la esencia era la misma
7725994 y cualquier persona que diga que no pierde piso est mintiendo la gente me dec a que hab a cambiado pero yo sab a que hab a cambiado con las personas que fueron malas conmigo y cuando me super me quede con un sentimiento en contra de ellos y quer an tratarme de manera distinta y ya no lo permit
7725995 mis sue os adem s de darle una casa a mis padres son muchos m s que se han ido cumpliendo entre ellos ser conocido y vivir de lo que me gusta hacer que es cantar
7725996 vivo en los aviones no tengo casa en ning n lado porque siempre ando de gira
7725997 for the record i noticed you fixed your teeth for the record i didnt think they were crooked
7725998 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7725999 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing

7726001 was the first country in latin america to go 100 smoke free
7726002 we are pleased that our efforts to help develop these guidelines will result in millions of lives saved around the world
7726003 in kenya the tobacco industry has consistently interfered with legislation designed to protect our people and workers from second hand smoke
7726004 now that the parties to the tobacco control treaty have formally adopted these guidelines they will prove to be an important tool in our efforts to protect kenyans from second hand smoke

7726007 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it

7726013 our peculiar security is in the possession of a written constitution let
7726014 informing congress and the public that the executive believes that a particular provision would be unconstitutional in certain of its applications or that it is unconstitutional on its face and that the provision will not be given effect by the executive branch to the extent that such enforcement would create an unconstitutional condition
7726015 stroke of the pen law of the land kind of cool
7726016 theres a different feel compared to what youre playing with today theres a different sensation that goes through the club into your hands and you know when you hit a wonderful shot with those clubs i can thank the company for bringing more of the fun of the game back that you dont even realize that youve lost
7726017 german sport has only one task to strengthen the character of the german people imbuing it with the fighting spirit and steadfast camaraderie necessary in the struggle for its existence
7726018 talking on the mobile phone while driving distracts the driver as does listening to music
7726019 the law always existed all we are doing is follow it seriously to prevent losing innocent lives i have already instructed traffic policemen in my jurisdiction mahim to dahisar to be extra cautious about such violators we will come down heavily on them in the coming days
7726020 the driver will be charged a fine if he is found playing music loud or soft
7726021 music is a hindrance to safe driving the driver cannot hear the horns paying attention to music could lead to accidents
7726022 the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7726023 the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7726024 i found the cooking of people living in the slums of soweto more diverse than ours

7726028 no matter how hard i try the dream of us never seems to fade
7726029 your epic work of fiction aka your labor time charges was a laugh
7726030 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7726031 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7726032 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7726033 while they still fly over the top in delivery these songs play like the best thin lizzy ac dc and nazereth ever screeched out of a garage
7726034 the mightiest of power trios that has gelled together like no motherfuckers god damn business
7726035 wisely enough theres nothing too fancy here bottled lightning just relentless cascades of bad ass riffs over a pulverizing rhythm pulse that makes most releases by their heavy rock contempories sound like the twee tinkering of emo weeds
7726036 along with priestess and pride tiger cmon are undeniably the kings and queen of canadian underground rock like their aforementioned brethen they kneel at the alter of the almighty riff but the biggest feather in cmons cap is that they sidestep the cliches and mindless idolatry that mar so much of their competition
7726037 this is capital r rock punchy loud sweet and bombastic this is a supersized order of rock hold the cliches and cheese
7726038 the energy and pure rock this album bottled lightning crunches out can go toe to toe with any rock band
7726039 consise yet explorative dynamic yet straight ahead and quite simply one motherfucker of a rock record bottled lightning
7726040 its a total thunderstorm of pure rock wizardry a bubbling brew of beard and eye of t v
7726041 i believe and i have faith in my heart and that is enough
7726042 countries who have not paid their voluntary assessed contribution on time you know who you are so do we

7726045 being sent back to manila is nothing i should be sorry with because there are a lot of things that i can still do to a lot of poor people here
7726046 it leaked maybe because of the excitement of many friends of cristina ponce enrile that shes going to be appointed to the vatican to take my place but its ok things happen like that
7726047 things really happen like that and im very happy that im back
7726048 it was very uplifting that the cbcp was behind me i found out that they really appreciated my work
7726049 some leave government because their names have been tainted by scandal some leave government because they did something wrong to the people they represented
7726050 someday the end will come someday the appointment will cease the authorization will stop like that day comes as death comes we pray that all government officials will be able to finish their terms untainted by scandals clean and clear transparent like clean water
7726051 he seems genuinely offended by harry reids description of george w
7726052 im not going to say im never going to do drugs again

7726054 it was the hardest thing for me when i realised i was pregnant and realised i wanted to have the baby i made a huge decision to make my life more stable
7726055 he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles
7726056 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch he turned 46 this summer and hes got a 29 year old wife and a young family so he wanted to get back in shape

7726062 her assistant posted a found german shepherd sign and the dogs owner diazs neighbor who was driving around the area came across it
7726063 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7726064 i have been wearing extensions for years and there is nothing out there like this product every woman should have one
7726065 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7726066 hitting bottom is not a weekend retreat or an encounter session
7726067 like duh cant you see im shilling for fox here
7726068 the difference between a communist amp a democrat is that the communist knows what he is doing
7726069 it came about at noon that elijah mocked them and said call out with a loud voice for he is a god either he is occupied or gone aside or is on a journey or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened so they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them when midday was past they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice but there was no voice no one answered and no one paid attention
7726070 hes still talkin bout the war on terror like it actually exists
7726071 along with my friends from pajamas media and provided volunteer bodyguard services thanks guys
7726072 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7726073 alleged violations of the laws of war by the milf in its recent attacks particularly in lanao del norte should be dealt with accordingly under its own processes
7726074 we support calls for an interfaith fact finding and mercy mission in conflict areas to show our solidarity and pastoral concern for the displaced
7726075 the peace negotiations cease to be authentic when it is used to extend the administrations term of office or if it exploits the current situation to push us closer to emergency rule as women religious we say no to these maneuverings and selfish designs
7726076 from our eyes of faith they are gods anawim belonging to the same family as the poor among christians and lumads in mindanao
7726077 anguish women and children who will be most vulnerable and traumatized in situations of all out offensives not to mention its lasting adverse effects on the environment
7726078 we grieve for the many lives lost in the still ongoing armed conflict in many of our mission areas we are currently accompanying thousands of internally displaced people as they struggle to secure themselves and their families in cramped classrooms public facilities and shared homes of relatives
7726079 we express concern that if the current all out war offensives of the government which comprises of air strikes indiscriminate shelling and militarization of communities will continue without let up we will be faced with a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions
7726080 at a time when the people have nothing to eat because of the grave economic crisis and food shortages all out war is simply a senseless and costly recourse of the arroyo government
7726081 what the hell do you think isnt working you saw the damn game this guy is your ace you got a 5 0 lead with the eighth and ninth hitters coming up you feel pretty good about that inning and all of a sudden it turns into a six run inning

7726087 to be fair and honest masama ang loob ko nagalit ako nung una kong dinig but i always know the truth is somewhere in the middle eh i learned that from kiko pangilinan her husband so siguro meron talagang nag isip na manadya kaya yun ang masakit
7726088 kaya nang malaman ko itong film project na baler labis akong natuwa at si nuportahan ko kaagad
7726089 nakorner noon ng filipino soldiers ang mga sundalong kastila sa simbahan ng baler at doon sila nagkanlong para hindi mapatay ng mga sundalong pinoy
7726090 ang hindi alam ng mga sundalong kastila ay tapos na ang giyera noon pero ayaw nilang maniwala noong una bandang huli ay gumawa ng paraan ang mga sundalong pinoy para mapalabas ang spanish soldiers sa pinagtataguan nilang simbahan
7726091 nang mapalabas ang nakorner na mga sundalong kastila akala nila papata yin na silang lahat sa halip buong puso silang tinanggap ng mga filipino at pinalakpakan pa habang papalabas sila ng baler church
7726092 at ang mga sunda long yun nang makabalik sa kanilang bansa ay ipinamalita ang kagandahang loob ng mga filipino yun ay naging usap usapan sa spain at marami pang nakakaalam nito roon hanggang ngayon
7726093 so ang pelikulang ba ler sa kabuuan ay tungkol sa kabayanihan at kabutihan ng mga pilipino
7726094 walang offer sakin to work with john lloyd at all and the truth is id really like to work with him someday
7726095 i have no reason para magalit sa kanya labas naman ako roon sa nangyari sa kanila noon ni ciara i even watch his tv shows and movies
7726096 i really feel uncomfortable kapag pinipilit kaming umamin e wala pa naman kaming aaaminin
7726097 i really hope they will give us more time kasi ayaw din naming madaliin at baka sabihin pang ginagamit namin yun just to promote our movie im really more at ease na friends muna kami
7726098 siyempre im very much excited noon si chard ang nagpunta sa abs now its my turn to go to gma for the first time is a light romantic drama sa gma naman were going to do more of a romantic comedy
7726099 suatu system berbasis digital untuk melakukan proses perekaman pemrosesan dan pengeditan audio
7726100 i will never feel like this again you have ruined every pleasure
7726101 it was agreed that there would be a nonpartisan candidate for presidents office which has been violated
7726102 we therefore feel that these repeated violations have forced us to withdraw our support for the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7726103 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
7726104 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
7726105 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7726106 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breath
7726107 im always living with the guilt that if im spending too much time at work then im not giving enough time to my girls
7726108 and then if im with my girls then im not doing enough for work or you name it its a guilt that we all live with in this room can i hear an amen
7726109 usually when issues get to the mayors office they have worked their way through the bureaucracy and the problems are sufficiently complicated that it takes somebody with a very level head and an honest broker and a sense of right and wrong and reason to sort them through
7726110 so we were looking for a person who could help us do that and michelle was outstanding at that
7726111 the mission of the organization was to identify and develop this next generation of nonprofit and community leaders and michelle interpreted that as trying to really find the people with the greatest passion for making a difference in their communities regardless of their background and helping turn that passion into a viable career path
7726112 and so thats a model that she really solidified for us that weve kept to this day this belief that leadership has to come from all parts of the community
7726113 what she helped us do was bring together sort of a strategy
7726114 a lot of people help mentor young people a lot of people help teach
7726115 but when she got to the power of influence about being married to a u s senator about being the wife of a rock star what did she do to affect positive change what she did is help a hospital a not for profit hospital carry out a strategy of maximizing profits
7726116 if you want good people to solve difficult issues i think the market sort of sets whats the price that we have to pay to attract and keep those people
7726117 if theres one thing that ive seen out there as ive traveled around the country over this last year is that women need an advocate in the white house now more than ever before
7726118 ill feel until the day i die that we didnt get justice for the family
7726119 driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do
7726120 there is no better person to validate barack obama than michelle obama
7726121 shes a terrific speaker she believes in the story of baracks journey and her own journey and she can deliver a stemwinder herself
7726122 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7726123 but i waited to give my super delegate vote until february 2008 when democrats abroad france my constituency voted in his favour by 71
7726124 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7726125 i think giving a nice chunk of fish to a pet is important to satisfy the personal hedonistic needs of the owner not the nutritional need of the cat cats will be very happy to eat the offal from a trout
7726126 its to savor the olympics that im taking part with pui pui
7726127 to be here and to take part in these outdoor events and to meet so many dogs and people makes pui pui very happy
7726128 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7726129 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process
7726130 no estamos todos del mismo lado como dem cratas pero ahora s estamos
7726131 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7726132 hitting bottom is not a weekend retreat or an encounter session
7726133 its a way that they could make a getaway vacation
7726134 the entire spectrum of the hotel market is feeling it
7726135 resort communities like hawaii have seen dramatic drops in visitation and occupancy
7726136 having the hotel has put us on parity with our competition because weve never had one to attract people before
7726137 the one thing we know from history and statistics is that people are very hesitant to give up their travel
7726138 its one of the things that americans want to do even when times are tough they try to figure out a way to get away
7726139 all of our revenue comes from selling products and services if we had a stronger sales force we could increase our revenues we are finding it near impossible to locate and retain professional achievers
7726140 well two things really firstly were here to help our members learn more sell more and earn more all too often those sales people who are crying out for more training and more opportunities to develop themselves are deprived of opportunities for learning and development because their employer doesnt think investing in their salespeople is a good use of company funds we enable individual sales people to get access to top sales training opportunities and learning material on a regular basis for much less than they would have to pay to put themselves through the average sales training or personal development program this year we put on three free sales seminars with top speakers next year were planning four and theyll run in both auckland and wellington and our offering will continue to grow as the membership base develops the rsn also provides members with an objective third party they can call to discuss any sales or career difficulties they may be facing at any time secondly were working hard to provide those sales people who are committed to ongoing learning and development with a way to differentiate themselves in the market joining the rev sales network is just as much about what it says about you as it is about the services you get access to
7726141 for 2008 the new zealand institute of management has agreed to sponsor memberships so apart from the time it takes to attend our seminars make use of the tools and commit to upholding our code of sales ethics its free fees will be 195 per year from 2009
7726142 as a sales person it often seemed like i was the only one who saw the correlation between learning and results the more i learned the better my sales skills and consequent income became so the first motivation was to provide a useful organisation for the sales people out there who wanted to get ahead to enable them to take more responsibility for their own development and network with other like minded forwarding thinking sales professionals we also noticed that there were a whole lot of services surrounding the industry being really poorly done for example the recruitment of sales people and the training of sales managers sales managers are often thrown in the deep end of sales management without any support
7726143 most of the sales people we deal with are in b2b sales and thats definitely our focus
7726144 i think nz sales manager has taken off like it has mainly because nzs sales professionals have secretly been crying out for a publication all of their own
7726145 thats a good question liam and im glad you asked while there is a surprisingly large amount of work that goes into each issue nz sales manager will definitely continue to be free for the foreseeable future the whole idea is to help cultivate that culture of ongoing learning and development in the sales profession and that could take a while
7726146 we wanted to acknowledge his tremendous efforts to help the hurrican recovery so his speech to the delegates was delivered through the video package
7726147 to win in three sets is always a good result
7726148 i had some difficult moments so thats going to help me a little bit to be prepared for the pressure moments later in the tournament i played well when i had the pressure moments
7726149 i am a little bit tired yes but it is the us open so i have to try my best here
7726150 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7726151 i think i helped him a little bit to play to this level but hes a good player and he played well
7726152 i learned that i could play with the number one in the world
7726153 i had my chances but i missed too much it was really fun to play in front of a big crowd
7726154 it would seem that some people have decided its better to steal our tropical plants than rent them
7726155 remember its all about return on investment the rest is just conversation
7726156 we have money we stay in nice hotel why we want to sleep outside
7726157 theres no liquor here bring beer you can bring wine if you want but its not the place to savor that 1990 french cabernet
7726158 its to savor the olympics that im taking part with pui pui
7726159 to be here and to take part in these outdoor events and to meet so many dogs and people makes pui pui very happy
7726160 t his year alone we are collecting 31 million in taxes and interest into the fund but are only spending 7 million of it if we dont act now in ten years procomp will have over 300 million just sitting in the bank
7726161 this is taking it in the shorts what other profession says after the 14 years you dont get any more money

7726166 we are planning to launch a new company which will be named
7726167 the cpl is a globally recognised brand that has more history in the videogame industry than all other leagues combined we look forward to reintroducing gamers to a better larger and more exciting cpl
7726168 this acquisition is just the kind of positive support that the international interactive entertainment industry needs i look forward to seeing cpl continue under new management adding further accolades to its history
7726169 i recently visited a cistercian monastery in france now converted to a hotel but which still has its ancient pigeonnier or dovecote pictured built over a shallow channel taken from the nearby stream this allowed innumerable birds to roost providing eggs for the monks and ensured that their droppings were not wasted down below the guano enriched water encouraged substantial numbers of crayfish in turn providing the monastery with useful protein yet again im impressed by how well our predecessors organised things to avoid waste i wonder whether similar buildings could be established in say trafalgar square turning london pigeons from a problem into something like a solution im glad to see at any rate that urban dovecots do exist as this one in glasgow makes clear
7726170 which may be a bit of a stretch but there aint nothing wrong with it
7726171 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar si no jugar bien
7726172 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7726173 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar
7726174 no creo que se espere m s de m ahora que hace tres semanas la exigencia es la que t te pones y la m a siempre es la m xima
7726175 protestar decisiones del rbitro en forma ostensible y burlona con palabras acciones y gestos
7726176 llop sigue en su cargo tiene amplio respaldo y todo indica que los refuerzos que quer a los tendr en breve
7726177 ser un partido muy fuerte porque todo mundo ha crecido en el f tbol venezuela as ha sido entonces va a ser complicado
7726178 no vamos a asunci n s lo para defendernos intentaremos aprovechar las oportunidades y si marcamos un gol quedar amos en buena posici n para clasificarnos
7726179 vamos a jugar como si estuvi ramos en uruguay con un f tbol equilibrado
7726180 lo primero ser tratar de cerrar nuestra porter a porque un empate nos da la clasificaci n pero sin renunciar a la ofensiva y con el objetivo de avanzar a la siguiente fase
7726181 sebenarnya penilaian sudah selesai dengan melihat apa yang tadi telah dipaparkan oleh sdit fi tapi berikutnya tinggal membuktikan apakah memang benar apa yang dipaparkan dan didukung bukti bukti yang lengkap
7726182 al baqoroh 197 mari kita jadikan momentum ini menjadi momentum perubahan diri tentu saja dalam makna perubahan menuju kebaikan ishlah guna merealisasikan amanah utama kita
7726183 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka mengabdi kepada ku
7726184 estoy contento por el resultado del domingo victoria ante estudiantes por 3 0 en la liga argentina y porque hoy se ha concretado lo de solari ya est arreglado
7726185 lo m s importante no son los premios individuales sino que el equipo est jugando bien y arriba de la clasificaci n
7726186 creo que cada vez hay mayor entendimiento entre todos y ah radica el xito que estamos teniendo esta temporada
7726187 debemos aspirar al m ximo con el equipo que tenemos pero eso hay que demostrarlo cada jornada en el campo
7726188 el pr ximo partido ser el m s importante y el que tendremos que ganar
7726189 we just want a roll call like youre supposed to have
7726190 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7726191 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7726192 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7726193 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7726194 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7726195 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7726196 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7726197 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7726198 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7726199 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7726200 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7726201 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7726202 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7726203 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7726204 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7726205 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7726206 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7726207 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7726208 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7726209 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7726210 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7726211 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7726212 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7726213 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7726214 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7726215 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7726216 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7726217 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7726218 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7726219 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7726220 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7726221 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7726222 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7726223 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7726224 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7726225 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7726226 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7726227 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7726228 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7726229 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7726230 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7726231 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7726232 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7726233 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7726234 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7726235 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7726236 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7726237 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7726238 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7726239 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7726240 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7726241 for the past four years newton north has been part of many memories that will stay with us forever weve won awards made life long friends attended proms and even became state champions however one day at north will especially stay clear in our minds forever as freshman the class of 2005 was still learning to find its way around the expansive north on our fourth day of high school the date was september 11th 2001 j ust about every senior ive asked remembers that day at newton north in fine detail it can be compared to the day president kennedy was assassinated and our parents remembering their exact whereabouts at the moment they found out as for myself my day started in mr vignones history class which went as usual except for him turning on the radio which he had never done my next class was english with ms craig olins it was here when mrs huntington made her first announcement to the school briefly describing what had happened up until that point i then remember hearing a rumor that more had happened then was announced but i brushed it off as crazy and impossible later in gym class we didnt do much because it was signup day so people quietly talked i heard ms baugher and another teacher talking about what they knew and it confirmed the rumor from earlier as soon as class let out i went to the library and got on a computer to see for myself a small crowd of stunned kids gathered around to see too not much else went on at school that day although i did sneak into a classroom that had the news on for a little while i dont think many kids including myself really understood how big the events of the day were at that time however it seemed more serious when the bus my friend and i took home everyday was free of charge just to get everyone home safe that night aside from being glued to the television i looked through some photos and video i had taken myself less than a month earlier on a trip to new york which i am now so glad to have for the newton north class of 2005 we are the last students to have been at north on that day and even after a new school is built its something we wont ever forget

7726246 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7726247 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7726248 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7726249 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7726250 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7726251 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7726252 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7726253 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7726254 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7726255 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7726256 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7726257 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7726258 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7726259 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7726260 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7726261 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7726262 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7726263 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7726264 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7726265 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7726266 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7726267 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7726268 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7726269 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7726270 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7726271 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7726272 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7726273 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7726274 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7726275 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7726276 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7726277 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7726278 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7726279 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7726280 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7726281 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7726282 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7726283 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7726284 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7726285 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7726286 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7726287 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7726288 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7726289 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7726290 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7726291 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7726292 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7726293 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7726294 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7726295 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7726296 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7726297 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7726298 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7726299 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7726300 children in this age group have not developed the skills and experience to navigate traffic safely and judge speed and distance
7726301 in 2001 children 15 years and younger accounted for 59 percent of all bicycle related injuries seen in u s emergency departments
7726302 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7726303 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7726304 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7726305 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7726306 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7726307 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7726308 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7726309 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7726310 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7726311 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7726312 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7726313 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7726314 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7726315 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7726316 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7726317 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7726318 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7726319 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7726320 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7726321 where trucks daddy dey coming where trucks whats happnin daddy where big trucks

7726328 the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother
7726329 i think i should point out that fokker was the name of the german dutch aircraft company
7726330 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7726331 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7726332 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7726333 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7726334 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar sino jugar bien
7726335 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7726336 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar
7726337 no creo que se espere m s de m ahora que hace tres semanas la exigencia es la que t te pones y la m a siempre es la m xima
7726338 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7726339 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7726340 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7726341 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7726342 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7726343 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7726344 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7726345 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7726346 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7726347 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7726348 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7726349 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7726350 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7726351 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7726352 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7726353 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7726354 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7726355 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7726356 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7726357 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7726358 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7726359 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7726360 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7726361 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7726362 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7726363 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7726364 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7726365 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7726366 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7726367 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7726368 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7726369 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7726370 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7726371 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7726372 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7726373 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7726374 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7726375 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7726376 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7726377 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7726378 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7726379 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7726380 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7726381 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7726382 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7726383 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7726384 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7726385 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7726386 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7726387 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7726388 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7726389 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7726390 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7726391 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7726392 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7726393 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7726394 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7726395 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7726396 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7726397 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7726398 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7726399 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7726400 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7726401 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7726402 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7726403 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7726404 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7726405 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7726406 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7726407 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7726408 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7726409 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7726410 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7726411 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7726412 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7726413 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7726414 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7726415 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7726416 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7726417 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7726418 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7726419 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7726420 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7726421 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7726422 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7726423 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7726424 recusamos una propuesta de doce millones del zaragoza hace un mes
7726425 estamos muy contentos no es costumbre vender con tanta anticipaci n
7726426 no estamos acostumbrados en chile porque siempre andamos a ltima hora y ya quedan pocas entradas poco m s del diez por ciento y eso nos tiene muy satisfechos
7726427 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7726428 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7726429 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7726430 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7726431 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7726432 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7726433 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7726434 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7726435 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7726436 i performed on a high level both physically and psychologically during the tournament
7726437 before the games my goal rested simply on winning a medal i didnt expect to reap a gold
7726438 its a unique opportunity to raise the visibility of our organization and advocate positions that are important to us
7726439 and if i have an issue with those guys i let them know my stance whether they are here or not they are not going to tell me how to vote
7726440 we really pretty much rely on sponsorships from corporations and organizations that can afford to help
7726441 i think as long they can keep it at level of good will at the convention its all right
7726442 all of apis activities fully comply with the law and any ethics rules
7726443 house freshman democrats played an important role in passing the new ethics rules
7726444 any freshman democrat who does participate in the reception should be treated by the public and the media as failing to comply with the language meaning purpose and spirit of the new house ethics rule
7726445 many of these events are invitation only created as a way for high level politicians to rub shoulders with lobbyists and others with an interest in what happens once they are elected
7726446 im curious if people realize that compact fluorescent bulbs contain mercury
7726447 if i broke one i would just throw it away
7726448 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7726449 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7726450 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7726451 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7726452 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7726453 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7726454 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7726455 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7726456 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7726457 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7726458 the outbreak of doctors strikes in america is spreading these strikes so unusual in the united states are an early symptom of the spread to this country of a worldwide epidemic if you havent heard about any of these cases you are not alone doctors strikes outside the united states have apparently become so frequent that they are no longer regarded as newsworthy yet there is something shocking and dangerous in the idea of a doctors strike in the industrialized world we are blithely accustomed to the fact that when an emergency strikes when we fall seriously ill or even when we suffer from minor aches and pains a doctor will be there to diagnose the problem and solve it we take our doctors and the instant availability of their life saving knowledge and skills for granted if there is a worldwide scourge that is prompting these people to walk off the job it is crucially important to discover the cause a physician investigating the cause of a disease would begin by looking for a common element a risk factor that is present in all cases
7726459 when you think about the values that have shaped our lives our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up and making lemonade out of lemons
7726460 i want my first lady to be proud of and love america and americans
7726461 laura bush is the perfect role model for a first lady grace dignity honesty and pure of heart with a bit of spunk i cant see michelle obama filling her shoes
7726462 i am really impressed how she has taken those punches
7726463 she doesnt waver from criticism she stands on her own
7726464 wants to take an active legislative role but she will be very supportive
7726465 every first lady has a right to her own opinion
7726466 the first lady is not running anything shes not being elected
7726467 lo plurale y lo reale buena onda con lo reale
7726468 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7726469 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7726470 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7726471 i myself am made entirely of flaws stitched together with good intentions
7726472 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7726473 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7726474 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7726475 youre probably wishing you could sock me in the face
7726476 everyone you ever cared about has left you because youre fat ugly and clingy
7726477 this christmas i was violently ill after having eaten brand name pork
7726478 see all the love shes been saving it its whole life
7726479 is offering us the kind of vision and sense of urgency that has been so lacking in the presidential campaigns
7726480 what is good and not first what will succeed or make money
7726481 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7726482 then you realize you dont have any pictures any more you realize im cold and i have no clothes i have nothing left
7726483 its devastating apparently i just lost everything but what ive got on here
7726484 the house next to me just blew up these houses were blowing up like they were full of gas
7726485 dont pick some guy just because hes a military vet
7726486 on screen scarlett johansson has beguiled bill murray christan bale ewan mcgregor and woody allen offscreen shes been the face of loreal and louis vuitton so given this tony image it came as a bit of a surprise that her debut disc would be a collection of obscurities by the ever rumpled tom waits
7726487 the single biggest thing for speakers to understand in advance is that your speech is part of that tapestry
7726488 everyone thinks they have a great opening line but what they dont realize is everyone else has the same great line
7726489 in fact while the federal government provides historic tax credits for multi unit residences such as apartments and condominiums as well as for commercial buildings federal historic credits cannot be applied to single family residences what does the federal government know that missouri doesnt

7726503 hopefully these guys are young men that expect to succeed in any and everything they do
7726504 their mentality will be a little different than maybe a guy with some lesser skills i think they will be primed and eager to play and play well in this environment
7726505 hes a guy sometimes when things dont look like they are there he can make a big play and thats always exciting any time you give the ball to somebody and he has a chance to score every time he touches it thats fun
7726506 its just having confidence in what they are doing i think they have really worked hard at being able to gain that and it should show by game time
7726507 any time you have youth combined with some new coaching youre kind of hamstrung in terms of preparation
7726508 we thought that of all of our defensive players this young man might have shown himself as one of the better ones in terms of his overall play ability to hold the point get to the football
7726509 thats sort of an amazing deal and that may lead to some other people to do the same thing in not having surgery hes certainly a staple center senior im happy for him but im not happy for us
7726510 i feel really good about justin roper because he has proven he can do this and his development in the course of our bowl practices was instrumental in our teams confidence in that game
7726511 we think there is still some debate about all of that and hopefully those are some issues well sort out a little later

7726518 mr king has seen and approved the talent on the book the character sketches the scripts and all artwork
7726519 i literally read it midterm week and completely escaped into it so much so that i remember getting really emotional when some of the characters that id grown to love start dying
7726520 in reading the novel again for this adaptation what struck me the most was kings characterization
7726521 the storys huge obviously and has tons of great moments too many to pick a favorite honestly but whats truly amazing to me is how real and complicated each character is from our leads to our bit players
7726522 i did the adaptation it was given to an artist and submitted to king i guess
7726523 we havent had to gut anything any one sequence or any one character but every day its tough decision after tough decision do we have to lose that backstory thats a great line can we preserve it i will say though that ive been surprised and i think everyones been surprised by how successful weve been in preserving as much of the original material as we have

7726584 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines

7726586 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7726587 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep about 20 percent of adults in industrial countries have problems sleeping at one time or another the institute analysed scientific studies that cover a wide range of research on sleep and insomnia

7726599 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7726600 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7726601 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7726602 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7726603 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7726604 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7726633 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7726634 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7726635 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7726638 the west midlands commitment to an imaginative integrated transport system is an exciting one which deserves support a step change in public transport provision must be delivered as soon as it is feasible is right to want to make significant improvements to public transport before introducing serious car restraint measures such as congestion charging however the public need to be aware that public transport alone will not be enough to meet the regions transport and economic needs unless it is supported by congestion charging

7726651 i opted to drive this bus for positive reasons but now i regret my decision i start the bus directly on the second gear to avoid pain in my shoulder besides we also have to open and shut the door for passengers which is an added burden
7726652 we have not received any complaints from the drivers if they have any problems our management will ensure they are solved

7726664 most employees dont stay around for more than 45 days it is not lucrative for recruitment agencies it used to rake in money once upon a time but not anymore other industries with comparable salaries offer better shifts and concrete work experience besides professional growth salaries offered for freshers in call centres range from rs 7 000 to 15 000 which many industries such as hospitality events and media have caught up with

7726675 taxpayers including public officials from cities and counties have the legal right to this information
7726676 government must be accountable and transparent when government officials start drawing lines between what information they think the public should have access to and what information should be off limits where is the bright line
7726677 better for government to err on the side of providing the information when its legally requested even when on limited occasions its inconvenient and expensive
7726678 certainly exceptional this is the only one i know of that was this broad most requests are fairly reasonable and limited in scope

7726743 by 2012 there will be 5 trillion dollars looking for a home from the gcc countries china is a natural absorber of this liquidity surplus china should see qinvest as a unique way to attract the wealth of the gulf
7726744 we are ambitious about bringing the investment banking platform of choice to qatar and being a link between the gcc and the world
7726745 currently the relationship between china and the gcc could be characterized as opportunistic the region is challenged in that it does not know china that well and people from china do not know how to get the right contacts in qatar we recognize that we are in the early stage of the discussion and ask how this can change given that interests are aligned
7726746 we will be hiring the best investment bankers from around the world to achieve our ambitions
7726747 now is the time to be involved with the gcc and one should seriously consider qatar qatar is catching up to dubai and many people recognize that compared with other jurisdictions the regulatory framework legal framework qatar law for licensee which follows uk commercial law raises the bar additionally qatars relationships with the rest of the world are pristine and that is a big advantage when doing deals so its great to come from qatar

7726784 ode to a favourite cat that drowned in a tub of goldfishes
7726785 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7726786 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7726787 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7726788 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7726789 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7726790 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7726791 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7726792 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains
7726793 we come together and we say this is who we are god we need you we love you and were going to give everything to you its actually about the church coming together and singing with one voice one passion one heart giving all our praise to god
7726794 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
7726795 it was a difficult decision because we do not believe that emissions trading in itself will do much at all to reduce emissions
7726796 the biggest danger of this legislation is that it will reassure people that climate change has been addressed and we can get on with business as usual nothing could be further from the truth
7726797 we did not achieve an independent carbon authority but instead allocation plans will be scrutinised by parliament which will have the opportunity to overturn them if they are not fair and effective
7726798 the minister has admitted that this trading scheme will reduce projected emissions by only 2 percent far more than that is needed and quickly if the world is to avoid the huge financial social and environmental costs of a rapidly changing climate
7726799 the greens will continue to fight for greater energy efficiency standards better and more public transport accelerated technology change and a host of practical emissions reduction technologies which will save far more carbon than trading will
7726800 a price on carbon will help to encourage sustainable alternatives to our energy wasting unsustainable fossil fuel based way of life it is a start but it is not nearly enough

7726818 n o temos mais medo de ningu m antes a gente entrava na pista e s via gigantes do nosso lado agora nossos advers rios diminu ram de tamanho
7726819 it was horrible inside because they took our most precious things
7726820 they mean so much to us because some pictures are for our guardians and some of the kids have lost their parents
7726821 now we dont have any pictures and i was in the snow
7726822 now how can i explain them there is snow in america
7726823 i feel joy and hoping maybe we are getting better now
7726824 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
7726825 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
7726826 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
7726827 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
7726828 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
7726829 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
7726830 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
7726831 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
7726832 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
7726833 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

7726835 julgo que a tentativa de madonna de comparar john mccain a hitler ultrapassou os limites e um insulto a todos os americanos tanto democratas como republicanos

7726838 we are struggling to have enough money to hold together what we have let alone be able to think about the level of investment that would be needed to provide new infrastructure
7726839 private investment is playing an increasingly larger role in public infrastructure innovative public private partnerships are appearing around the country bringing much needed capital to the table
7726840 i am convinced that private dollars administered through public private partnerships are a significant part of the answer to our transportation infrastructure challenge
7726841 since congress is not likely to come up with adequate resources to help us meet our future infrastructure needs we have no option but to move on our own and find new ways of funding our capital needs
7726842 does not and will not have the resources to meet our future national infrastructure needs
7726843 a coalition of change agents at state level will bring about a fundamental reorientation in the way we approach transportation funding
7726844 a federal centric approach does not offer an adequate long term solution to closing the huge infrastructure funding gap
7726845 i think we ought to reconsider the perverse incentive that the tax code creates for such long leases if current depreciation rules lead to forms of investment that we judge to contravene public policy then the finance committee should consider changing those rules

7726880 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7726881 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7726882 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7726883 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7726884 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7726885 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7726886 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7726887 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains

7726922 the united states trade representative the ustr has totally ignored the massive strides china has made
7726923 flies in the face of the agreement between the two countries leaders to propose dialogue as a way of settling disputes
7726924 this will have an utterly negative impact and will inevitably badly damage bilateral intellectual property cooperation
7726925 the chinese government is extremely dissatisfied about this but we will proactively respond according to the related wto rules and see it through to the end
7726926 i am amazed by this inexplicable judgment that is totally out of step with chinese law

7726931 there isnt going to be a dry eye here we are all so used to him being strong

7726935 about two oclock this morning the officers wife heard a loud noise
7726936 she went to investigate looked out the window saw the hood and the trunk of the vehicle on fire on top of the metal not within the vehicle itself at that time she also saw what she described as a white male about 15 to 17 years of age 5 feet 8 inches slim build with close cropped hair kneeling by the car
7726937 but this is a very violent reaction to a marked police car and when you think of that and you think of what a person could do with that type of anger issues it concerns us a great deal

7726952 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
7726953 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
7726954 you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7726955 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7726956 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7726957 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7726958 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7726959 its egregious that we have allegations of an individual raping another individual that in and of itself is horrible

7727001 what happened in postville was an absolute travesty of justice that must never happen again

7727003 the attempt by cegir to build this toxic dump was in total violation of the human rights of oodham indigenous communities
7727004 if this dump had been built it would have been in violation of the integral oodham right to protect their traditional homelands and their continued responsibility to conduct their traditional way of life through ceremonies that have been held at quitovac since time immemorial

7727008 i realized that they the interrogators could not comprehend a student branch of an organization that a group could act independently we had to explain the concept of peaceful protest they thought we were all part of a huge conspiracy to destroy the chinese government
7727009 they were breaking us for information thats on the front page of our web site
7727010 it was horrifying to see these other people other foreigners caught up in the judicial system and chinese natives and knowing that for many of them their lives are over that they could disappear be sent to a labor camp killed i made a lot of friends but i keep thinking about all those people and the thousands of tibetans who disappear or are killed for doing what we did

7727032 it basically is a symbol to young people that its possible to have a place in politics and that our voice is just as important as everyone else and that we are the future of this party and so we should be leading it now
7727033 i think obama has a solid plan to deal with the situation in iraq and he has some very good advisers with him who are going to help him get the specifics and what we need to do according to the military getting out of iraq in a timely manner
7727034 i really get energized by the democratic party when i first got out of high school i was involved in the 2004 election trying to elect john kerry and from there i was just hooked
7727035 im so excited about barack obama with this upcoming election the youth vote is energized and its something that i have never seen in my young life so its exciting
7727036 just organizing on campuses as we got ready for the primaries as weve been getting ready for the general election weve been focusing so much on facebook myspace its just an easy way to reach our kids they are on it some 24 hours a day so its easy to reach them
7727037 sometimes dealing with the clintons is like dealing with brett favre
7727038 theyre very good players and theyve got a great record but sometimes youre not sure what they really want
7727039 taking it a little harder because he wanted his wife to succeed and also because he wants a good clinton legacy
7727040 ive probably done more for sen obama than anybody in my position has ever done by this time
7727041 i cant imagine he will continue to bum rap barack obama which is what hes been doing up until now unfortunately
7727042 we would love to see her in the white house
7727043 when someone tries to ram a vote by acclamation you can walk out of the convention
7727044 if you stay in that hall you can stand up and say we will not be silenced
7727045 we have a moral obligation to count the votes of the woman who achieved what no other woman in american politics has done and who in fact got 18 million votes
7727046 i will vote for obama but i will not vote for obama on the first ballot
7727047 lyndon johnson became president of the united states and bobby kennedy did not did that mean the end of kennedy politics in this country
7727048 the de facto legislative leader of the democratic party and the voice of the party on the hill
7727049 her range of options is probably more if barack obama wins i dont think john mccain will consider her for a cabinet position or the supreme court but barack obama may well
7727050 if she wants another shot at the white house obviously it makes it easier if obama doesnt win
7727051 but that doesnt help her with the democratic party if she doesnt actively help him
7727052 what exactly about the clinton era of the 90s dont you want to go back to
7727053 one of the most prosperous economies in the countrys history and international relations where bill clinton was one of the most popular figures in the world
7727054 we know she was first lady and ran for president
7727055 in the name of the hard working americans who make up our forgotten middle class i proudly accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
7727056 my fellow americans after these four good hard years i still believe in a place called hope a place called america
7727057 now my hair is a little grayer my wrinkles are a little deeper but with the same optimism and hope i brought to the work i loved so eight years ago i want you to know my heart is filled with gratitude
7727058 my friends after three conventions as a candidate or a president tonight i come to you as a citizen returning to the role that i have played for most of my life
7727059 some of us women in politics are going to take hard knocks
7727060 to raise a happy healthy and hopeful child it takes a family it takes teachers it takes clergy it takes business people it takes community leaders it takes those who protect our health and safety it takes all of us yes it takes a village and it takes a president
7727061 bill and i are closing one chapter of our lives and soon well be starting a new one for me it will be up to the people of new york to decide whether ill have the privilege of serving them in the united states senate
7727062 i think i know a great leader when i see one and so does america in 1992 and 1996 americans chose a president who left our country in better shape than when he took office
7727063 israel is erasing the green line through intensive construction intended to create territorial continuity between settlement blocs and isolated settlements in the heart of the west bank with this construction approaching palestinian cities such as bethlehem and ramallah
7727064 being someone who hasnt really been around babies or kid products i just didnt know what to choose
7727065 i was overwhelmed by the little things which toys to buy which are developmentally helpful
7727066 te beginnen bij het elftal onder zeventien jaar het uiteindelijke doel is hoofdcoach te worden
7727067 i cant decide if the faux intimacy of daddy tele parenting in the middle of the convention was a bit too precious
7727068 on the other hand im a cynical coastal elite type and could just be insufficiently appreciative of camp
7727069 its no small thing when both sides can talk american exceptionalism its a start
7727070 i miss the old michelle and i think a lot of other women do too
7727071 not the scripted stepford wife fist bumping elisabeth hasselbeck but the sassy better half who reminded us that while barack was the answer he was also stinky in the morning and forgot to put the butter away she both affirmed his promise and humanized him
7727072 michelle obama introduced herself as a sister a wife a mother and a daughter which are all incredibly important identities
7727073 but those identities dont reveal her full person the princeton and harvard law grad the corporate attorney the hospital executive which were parts of her life that she barely mentioned
7727074 it almost makes you long for the days when politicians wives were seen but not heard after all if theyre not permitted to really say anything whats the point of having them speak
7727075 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7727076 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7727077 the cattle barons ball is one of the events that has allowed the american cancer society to grant more than 3 billion to the nations most promising cancer researchers over the past six decades

7727084 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
7727085 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
7727086 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop
7727087 i dont know the pressure per square inch but it surely took a real athlete to handle the kind of bows they used back then but thats the point this movie is going to feel real it makes a legend we all know feel historically relevant
7727088 while the pieces are beautifully crafted the museum store was also attracted to this group because of the diverse cross section of the community that it represents

7727105 im happy with how things are going right now im hoping to turn my season around as much as i can theres still time left to do some good things weve got five weeks
7727106 everybody goes through slumps but ive never gone through one this long its been 4 months and its just been a real grind but the team has stuck with me and im thankful for that
7727107 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7727108 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country

7727135 in the livermore valley the smoke cleared quickly and did not accumulate the same weather patterns that bring the fog in from the bay also serve to clear the air of smoke thus there was imperceptible impact from the smoke
7727136 as for frost i saw my first frost damage in livermore in my 8 harvests here that too was minimal and the shoot tips grew through the frost and we have seen no yield or quality impact in our vineyards
7727137 in our monterey vineyards as in the livermore valley arroyo seco has windy afternoons which bring in cool air from the pacific clearing the air

7727172 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7727173 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7727174 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7727175 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7727176 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7727177 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7727178 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7727179 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7727180 if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7727181 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another

7727193 my she sured be purty without that paci in her mouth
7727194 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
7727195 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7727196 hes a good dude hes real honest about who he thinks are tough pitchers
7727197 i had a feeling he was sitting on a breaking ball
7727198 even if he sits on it its hard to hit sometimes
7727199 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
7727200 he was patient he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball
7727201 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7727202 when he takes the mound hes throwing filthy filthy stuff
7727203 six rbis a couple of homers i think its the right time
7727204 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen against us this year
7727205 whenever they give me the ball im going to take it
7727206 big difference is when the guys pounding the zone throwing strikes
7727207 when i got in i regretted it my hamstrings were tight and my quads hurt
7727208 he sure does have a keen eye for a lot of little things
7727209 when youre a good hitter you can make adjustments pretty quick
7727210 he looked pretty impressive to me he drove the ball he hit hard and he hit it to all fields
7727211 hes looking like the hitter he was early in the season wed like to get him back to the no 5 hole and if he keeps swinging the bat like that thats where hell be
7727212 i havent been swinging the bat well and i needed to square some balls up and hopefully that will get me going and i can contribute again to this team thats playing so well
7727213 i didnt throw strikes and when i did they hit them
7727214 its a good lineup from top to bottom and even though they had some guys who were struggling they can hit
7727215 karstens wasnt hitting his spots and you cant do that against this lineup
7727216 its definitely nice when were swinging the bats the way were capable of
7727217 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7727218 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7727219 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7727220 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7727221 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7727222 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7727223 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7727224 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7727225 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can
7727226 anytime you got a team like minnesota thats right there and were getting close to september that kind of enhances it
7727227 its nice to win this one it hard after the first game it gets you down
7727228 thome has been my favorite player since i was old enough to know about him with the indians
7727229 it was good to get him out the two times but i left a mistake right there for him the last one
7727230 our lineup has changed since the lineup was out there so we were looking at the lineup card to see where we were all at unfortunately we didnt pull it out
7727231 what the fuck would you know youre just some pathetic troll who wastes his days attacking people who are actually trying to do something worthwhile
7727232 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering

7727236 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7727237 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7727238 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7727239 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7727240 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay

7727242 london is such a huge location on the world stage

7727263 will future electronic devices be charge based like they are today for our cmos technologies or are they going to rely on some other quantum property like spin or might they use some sort of molecular technology where we use molecules to perform the logic function
7727264 gives robotic hands the ability to sense an object before it touches it
7727265 this is the kind of sense that fish have sharks can do it and eels can do it but if we ever had it as humans weve long since lost that capability
7727266 being able to grip is a fundamental ability for humans so our question becomes can we imbue machines with a comparable capability
7727267 we may see new types of sensor modalities such as pretouch coming into widespread use as a result of our attempt to mimic human capabilities
7727268 at 70 percent efficiency we could wirelessly recharge all kinds of electronic devices even laptops just by building coils into work surfaces and then bringing your laptop or other battery powered device into proximity to recharge it
7727269 what if we could build nanoscale devices with a little bit of intelligence and mobility that could assemble themselves into arbitrary shapes imagine a future printing device that you fill up with programmable matter push the button and out comes a complete 3d object capable of movement color change luminescence
7727270 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7727271 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7727272 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7727273 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7727274 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7727275 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7727276 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7727277 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7727278 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7727279 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7727280 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7727281 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7727282 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7727283 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7727284 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7727285 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7727286 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7727287 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7727288 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7727289 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7727290 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7727291 on tuesday they announced it to the cast and i wasnt there
7727292 so i came in the next day and i was getting ready like i usually do and there was this weird mood on set so i asked what was going on and it was actually chuck who told me
7727293 its a shock its like any big news theres a process you go through youre sad youre angry youre worried about whats going to happen theres a sense that its a real shame the cast and crew have been together so long that its a real blast doing the show
7727294 but you have to remember weve been doing it for five years
7727295 for a lot of shows in this day and age thats a major accomplishment
7727296 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
7727297 i am looking at 807 as the support level for spot gold today the upside is quite high at around 835 for a start and then followed by 850 lets see how it goes
7727298 physical buying remains firm going into the festive period and that may support gold i guess we will still be trading in a range of 800 to 845
7727299 you imply that people should blow into the haggis and eat the bagpipes instead of the other way around your suggestion is good as it would improve the taste of one and the sound of the other
7727300 indians typically use a gods name for their children their cows and their elephants with a million gods to choose from its easy but dogs are usually given an english name such as jimmy tommy or johnny
7727301 when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one
7727302 we have addressed one major type of broadband blackspot with nakedextreme
7727303 to date adsl service providers have delivered broadband using a spectrum sharing service which co exists with an analogue telephone service across the copper access network
7727304 that message occurs if the line produces a signal attenuation over its length exceeding the allowable limit for a traditional analogue voice service
7727305 to date we have succeeded in connecting broadband customers living as far as 7 5 km from the exchange with that increased radius we can increase the coverage area by more than three times compared with the previous 4 1km broadband delivery limit so we see great potential to fill in many of the blackspots that exist in metropolitan areas
7727306 una posibilidad en enero del a o que viene de que haya un nuevo presidente en los estados unidos de norteam rica
7727307 por su personalidad por su discurso por su forma de enfocar las cosas absolutamente diferente

7727310 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7727311 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7727312 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7727313 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7727314 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7727315 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7727316 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7727317 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace
7727318 to lose him is going to be painful it will feel like were losing those dreams of making the world a better place

7727324 your concern has employed chinese workers in india without proper work permits in large numbers much beyond the permissible limits
7727325 over and above these expatriates are not paying applicable income tax for which they do not have immunity this is in complete disregard to the law of the land and misuse of liberty leading to indulgence in fraudulent act
7727326 the company strictly complies with indian tax regulations and mandates since inception we have been paying our statutory liabilities in terms of personal income tax and corporate income tax regularly
7727327 will draw contempt and forces the authority to slap show cause notice and proceed with deportation and legal options
7727328 our chinese staff who hold business visa routinely go back to headquarters once their training and customer care assignments are over and also go back for renewing their business visas
7727329 they have lights they also have a siren they have a headlight that is adjustable so if we pull up to an incident we can shine the light as we need to
7727330 they can go over all terrain and just a lot easier for us to get around
7727331 a lot of times they look at us like oh its security but this get us to where we can talk to them and they get to know us better
7727332 one thing we are trying to do is be a part of the campus be more visible this allows officers to go right up on scene
7727333 take them both out and then put them back in and thats it

7727335 what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
7727336 it was a pop next thing you know it was a bunch of smoke and it was in flames
7727337 we have hurt hearts just knowing that there are hundreds of families that look forward to this truck pulling up
7727338 weve heard all the great things that kelly does for all the people and we wanted to give her a token of our appreciation
7727339 where a lot of the moms cant necessarily afford the day car so i provide food
7727340 a majority of my income goes for food and she has been such a blessing
7727341 its innovative some of the technology in this cabin has to be seen to be believed
7727342 we do need more but we need to get more funding
7727343 it is a dynamic festival that changes each year and reinvents itself it goes from strength to strength
7727344 but one of the issues is the amount of accessible accommodation for people
7727345 i was just johnny on the spot i would have hoped if i was in the same situation someone else would help me and do the same thing
7727346 ive never seen a vehicle go up so quickly in all my time in the towing industry
7727347 i climbed in through the window and the bloke had his legs on fire and i couldnt get him out of the seat
7727348 i soon realised he was trapped by his seat belt so i cut him out with my pocket knife and dragged him out of the window
7727349 another bloke helped me get him out of the window
7727350 it was a painters van so it had turps paints thinners in it and it was starting to catch fire
7727351 it all happened in five minutes but seemed to take about half an hour i was amazed at how many people pulled up and drove off not many stopped to help
7727352 todays announcement of national bravery awards recognises the heroic actions of those among us who have placed the safety and lives of others before their own
7727353 they are cutting down trees for the placement of road barriers which does nothing for the safety of motorcyclists and trucks
7727354 what they need to do is duplicate the highway and create more truck stops
7727355 any crash with a motorcyclist travelling more than 35 kilometres an hour can result in a fatality
7727356 its all about costing they need to be seen to be making a genuine effort to reduce the risks to motoring
7727357 a real genuine effort would be to duplicate the highway
7727358 what they should be doing is creating more truck stops
7727359 we need to do away with harmful road side objects like wire road barriers steel posts and concrete poles
7727360 trees are removed where there is insufficient space to install barriers to protect motorists from crashing into trees if they run off the road this reduces the severity and frequency of these types of crashes
7727361 we had really healthy debate on some important issues and they werent afraid to disagree with each other or disagree with council
7727362 they had obviously thought about the issues they had researched and were quite passionate about their views which was excellent
7727363 they were in the chair when that came up and they voted to euthanase with guns
7727364 the kids debated everything and it ended up getting quite heated but it was really good they really enjoyed the power plays
7727365 we met at lunch time that day and went over the agenda and then it was up to them to spend the rest of the day coming up with their own opinions
7727366 the students got to see the way council operates and learnt a bit about the way meetings are structured
7727367 they got sent the materials about three weeks beforehand and then had to build it
7727368 they had watched a few videos from previous years so they had a reasonable idea of what worked
7727369 we dont have good numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
7727370 you practically had to guard your field with an army
7727371 a lot of people got rich and suddenly everybody was planting agave
7727372 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
7727373 when the price of agave is low people get demoralized and abandon their crops
7727374 but im not going to become a corn farmer yet these little ones still have a future
7727375 i think it is essential to define what you think the students should be doing in your lab thats what i might help with but it would not be to prescribe but to discuss with the stakeholders what their view is and to try and apprise them of the most current thinking on the topic and maybe put them in touch with current thinkers there are several communities of tech savvy educators who are in perpetual discourse on this topic if i were to have input on this process think it would be to put your practitioners in touch with this community through its blogs podcasts live webcasts presentations and seminars etc and get some dialog going as to what you want the students to do otherwise that crucial aspect is driven by the vendors which will sidetrack you until someone comes along and sees what you have in hand and figures out how that can be used to instantiate a viable view of language learners and how your students can best learn via technology
7727376 im seeing the ball very good so thats a little surprising too
7727377 thats good because ive got to get on base as much as i can
7727378 im the same guy aggressive at home plate but im trying to swing at strikes
7727379 thats why im trying to be more selective at home plate be aggressive at home plate but swing at strikes
7727380 he had a nice batting practice session today if hes swinging the bat why not let him play
7727381 i dont think so we really didnt change anything dramatically
7727382 all we did was shorten his stride which is something thats relatively simple its not an overhaul of any kind its not changing anything at all the stance or the way you hold your hands its just trying to get your foot down quicker so that you get a better look at the ball and you make a more compact swing
7727383 it will be the toughest race ever as there will be many challenges the contestants will not expect and be mentally prepared for the teams will have shorter resting time the journey will be harder and the speed of the race will be faster and more intense this combined with the new cast you can expect many dramatic moments tears twists and turns and an overall thrilling ride for viewers
7727384 the amazing race asia is a mega production and we have only been able to create this world world class production because of the faith of our valuable partners many like sony electronics asia pacific caltex nokia and standard chartered bank are long time supporters of asian franchise and we are proud to bring in our new partners singha corporation and maskargo to the race

7727388 we were thrilled at the response from modern design dealers and collectors
7727389 these pieces were from a single estate and fresh to market which makes them even more attractive to bidders
7727390 we are pleased to be able to provide collectors and dealers with the information they need to make informed decisions related to the commerce of this hobby
7727391 we sold well over 100 000 items during this time
7727392 obviously it proved impossible to include data for all of these items
7727393 this is our new managements first attempt at a project like this
7727394 we learned a lot about the publishing process during the endeavor and look forward to incorporating feedback from collectors in producing subsequent editions
7727395 jos unique blend of knowledge and experience made her an ideal choice for this important position she combines skills in management with a real understanding of the challenges faced by artists making her an ideal choice to take viscopy forward into a new and dynamic chapter
7727396 jo has built a very impressive reputation in the uk and internationally her appointment by viscopy is terrific news for artists in australia and new zealand
7727397 it is a privilege to be given the opportunity to lead an organisation such as viscopy which has an essential part to play in ensuring the governments of australia and new zealand do the right thing for their artists the artists resale right is hugely important not least for indigenous artists many of whom continue to be poorly rewarded for their work despite its popularity throughout the world
7727398 it is just laziness from ea that they dont include info with the updates
7727399 the effects of marijuana on sleep are often not included in information provided to clients in substance use treatment settings this information when combined with other information on marijuanas effects can help clients make informed choices concerning their use

7727404 this convention is much too liberal for the country plus its boring
7727405 this has been entirely without substance two hours just frittered away with a lot of hoopla
7727406 when i went to beijing i left him for two weeks and it was heart breaking not so much my husband but my son
7727407 its obviously not easy to be a family when you have two working parents and one travelling well have to see how i feel if theres any motivation how it affects everybody thats involved with us and take it from there
7727408 each time i play a grand slam i always think that it could be my last time playing here
7727409 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen i dont make decisions for the future anymore
7727410 im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here at her main draw debut nearly two decades ago he said that as a teenaged wild card she was just thrilled to walk through the gates of the tennis complex i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds i cant believe the usta let me have a wildcard ill never forget this day
7727411 becoming a champion 1998 and now coming back as a mom and as a former number one its just all overwhelming i never thought when i was growing up and playing that i would ever be in a champion like position
7727412 this was the first u s open it was a very good time for something positive to happen in the sports world
7727413 i still get a thrill to be around rod laver and champions of the past and billie jean i idolised them when i was growing up
7727414 this one is very special and also a special year to win in 68
7727415 it was nice to finally make it legal so we could go play
7727416 youd play seven months of the year and go home and youd made 5 000
7727417 officials were mad if anybody turned professional because there went your draw card they finally saw the light and had open tennis which we all knew was going to be successful
7727418 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7727419 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7727420 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7727421 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7727422 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
7727423 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
7727424 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7727425 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7727426 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7727427 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7727428 i tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7727429 barack doesnt care where youre from he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise
7727430 i dont dismiss the possibility that it could be higher but thats the very likely scenario
7727431 donors recognize that this is a good year for democrats and this financial advantage will be used to solidify their position
7727432 the fact that the republican party will not be able to bury the democrats in money this time will make a difference
7727433 its kind of like a giant chess game doing well in certain states gives you the opportunity to move into other ones
7727434 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7727435 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7727436 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7727437 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7727438 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7727439 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7727440 is truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7727441 not only will everybody in our delegation be on their feet when he comes out everybody will be standing on their seat
7727442 this is important for the convention because of all that hes meant to our party over the years
7727443 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7727444 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7727445 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7727446 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7727447 the greatest legacy kennedy would want would be an obama victory in november
7727448 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7727449 you could see it as the word spread around town today from person to person
7727450 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7727451 sometimes dealing with the clintons is like dealing with brett favre
7727452 theyre very good players and theyve got a great record but sometimes youre not sure what they really want
7727453 taking it a little harder because he wanted his wife to succeed and also because he wants a good clinton legacy
7727454 ive probably done more for sen obama than anybody in my position has ever done by this time
7727455 i cant imagine he will continue to bum rap barack obama which is what hes been doing up until now unfortunately
7727456 we would love to see her in the white house
7727457 when someone tries to ram a vote by acclamation you can walk out of the convention
7727458 if you stay in that hall you can stand up and say we will not be silenced
7727459 we have a moral obligation to count the votes of the woman who achieved what no other woman in american politics has done and who in fact got 18 million votes
7727460 i will vote for obama but i will not vote for obama on the first ballot
7727461 lyndon johnson became president of the united states and bobby kennedy did not did that mean the end of kennedy politics in this country
7727462 the de facto legislative leader of the democratic party and the voice of the party on the hill
7727463 her range of options is probably more if barack obama wins i dont think john mccain will consider her for a cabinet position or the supreme court but barack obama may well
7727464 if she wants another shot at the white house obviously it makes it easier if obama doesnt win
7727465 but that doesnt help her with the democratic party if she doesnt actively help him
7727466 what exactly about the clinton era of the 90s dont you want to go back to
7727467 one of the most prosperous economies in the countrys history and international relations where bill clinton was one of the most popular figures in the world
7727468 we know she was first lady and ran for president
7727469 in the name of the hard working americans who make up our forgotten middle class i proudly accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
7727470 my fellow americans after these four good hard years i still believe in a place called hope a place called america
7727471 now my hair is a little grayer my wrinkles are a little deeper but with the same optimism and hope i brought to the work i loved so eight years ago i want you to know my heart is filled with gratitude
7727472 my friends after three conventions as a candidate or a president tonight i come to you as a citizen returning to the role that i have played for most of my life
7727473 some of us women in politics are going to take hard knocks
7727474 to raise a happy healthy and hopeful child it takes a family it takes teachers it takes clergy it takes business people it takes community leaders it takes those who protect our health and safety it takes all of us yes it takes a village and it takes a president
7727475 bill and i are closing one chapter of our lives and soon well be starting a new one for me it will be up to the people of new york to decide whether ill have the privilege of serving them in the united states senate
7727476 i think i know a great leader when i see one and so does america in 1992 and 1996 americans chose a president who left our country in better shape than when he took office
7727477 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7727478 actual real windows where i can put up some screens
7727479 were trying to update the communities a little and keep them attractive both for the people who are here and who might come here
7727480 a catastrophic mistake that has cost thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars
7727481 has weakened our standing in the world and our capability to protect the american people
7727482 but our journey to take our nation in a new direction cannot be complete without new leadership in the white house
7727483 democrats know we cant afford any more of the same failed republican path
7727484 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7727485 our party and our country are strengthened by her candidacy
7727486 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7727487 ayers is clearly a relevant issue as it relates to obamas pattern of relationships
7727488 its hard to see how one actually could resolve having any sort of relationship with an admitted remorseless domestic terrorist
7727489 be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7727490 the last time obama saw ayers was about a year ago when he crossed paths with him while biking in the neighborhood
7727491 the suggestion that ayers was a political adviser to obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false
7727492 the notion that me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
7727493 it was a difficult time but those days are long over
7727494 an attempt to demonize bill as a way of damaging barack obama
7727495 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7727496 i said i had a thousand regrets but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength
7727497 i have met and like john mccain but he bombed and presumably killed many people in a war i opposed
7727498 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
7727499 i know this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters
7727500 in missouri we have a ringside seat to the real america and i can assure it looks much different
7727501 its time for someone who understands the real america the waitresses small businessmen single moms and truck drivers
7727502 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7727503 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7727504 well have free online training and virtual classrooms available so the individuals dont have to leave their office its pretty flexible for our partners
7727505 weve had excellent online sales training for a long time and very high end technical certifications as well but we really needed to close that gap in the middle with pre sales technical support to help our partners better understand what the product does
7727506 weve tried to focus to make the training much more flexible and each partner depending on where they fit can pick or choose whats best for them
7727507 that will be around how to look at the solutions and how to take a broader approach to understanding the entire offering rather than point by point products
7727508 well continue to invest time in training our partners on all of our products and also provide licence training through partnernet
7727509 alleged violations of the laws of war by the milf in its recent attacks particularly in lanao del norte should be dealt with accordingly under its own processes
7727510 we support calls for an interfaith fact finding and mercy mission in conflict areas to show our solidarity and pastoral concern for the displaced
7727511 the peace negotiations cease to be authentic when it is used to extend the administrations term of office or if it exploits the current situation to push us closer to emergency rule as women religious we say no to these maneuverings and selfish designs
7727512 from our eyes of faith they are gods anawim belonging to the same family as the poor among christians and lumads in mindanao
7727513 anguish women and children who will be most vulnerable and traumatized in situations of all out offensives not to mention its lasting adverse effects on the environment
7727514 we grieve for the many lives lost in the still ongoing armed conflict in many of our mission areas we are currently accompanying thousands of internally displaced people as they struggle to secure themselves and their families in cramped classrooms public facilities and shared homes of relatives
7727515 we express concern that if the current all out war offensives of the government which comprises of air strikes indiscriminate shelling and militarization of communities will continue without let up we will be faced with a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions
7727516 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries
7727517 it hasnt been two hours dont even think about giving him to me
7727518 oh in about 15 mintues then you can have my spot
7727519 leading to that awful pump and feed with a syringe routine that im sure some of the rest of you are familiar with
7727520 its that if you dont bf your child will be sickly and stupid full stop
7727521 studies that show your child will be just fine without bf

7727526 im losing 20 percent of my strength per day if i dont do anything about it the injury will end up rupturing and then the surgery will be more difficult its not easy because surgery never is
7727527 its a different injury than the pectoral tear because that was more of a muscle injury this is concerning my bones which has a lot less blood flow than muscle tissue it also has to do with my neck which is a very fragile area
7727528 every moment i stay away from the table is another moment something bad can happen the disk is so bulged out and inflamed that any sudden move could make it worse
7727529 you can either do one or two things you can be upset or pout or you can know what to do to get better
7727530 im already in the mode of getting the surgery as quick as i can
7727531 in the last ten months ive really focused on functional strength training and im stronger than ive ever been my goal is to talk to the neurosurgeon about how quickly i can get back to full throttle training and getting back into the ring and thats the ultimate goal to be strong as i can and get back into the ring as soon as possible
7727532 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
7727533 because hes a man he dont need to be using no womans bathroom
7727534 what if we came in and seen hes standing up instead of sitting down
7727535 i assume this is a reference to her segment but did they really need to phrase it like that in the official schedule
7727536 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7727537 t hat your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do

7727559 as psychiatrists were both connoisseurs of quirky and wed certainly seen a lot of strange things on our year long trip but we were particularly looking forward to the ufo festival in roswell as a rare opportunity to observe weirdness recreationally without the expectation we would do anything about it
7727560 we didnt have to worry about whether the ufos were weather balloons or the real thing we didnt have to decide whether apollo astronaut edgar mitchells theory about a government cover up was on target or whether he was still somewhere in outer space it wasnt our problem we were able to enjoy the ufo festival without a care in the world especially since there was no mention of anal probes
7727561 wed better unlearn years of professional practice making eye contact with people
7727562 after spending a year on the road in a converted bus experiencing a fire armed robbery visit from elvis and finding ourselves among nudists ive seen just about everything and very little in this world or any other could surprise me
7727563 in these tough economic conditions performance improvement must head the list of priorities for all business leaders our goal in these workshops is to share the best practices that lead to sustained performance improvement and provide a platform for delegates to network
7727564 i nexus has worked with over 100 performance improvement programs in global companies we have developed a unique knowledge base of what practices do and in some cases do not produce the best results now seems the perfect time to share that knowledge and these free to attend workshops are ideal to start that process

7727568 on balance and given the very significant changes that we have achieved we have decided it is better to make a start than to do nothing and so we have told the government this morning we will vote for a scheme that proceeds on the basis of what we have negotiated so far
7727569 we have won 1 billion to insulate and upgrade new zealand homes to make them warm and dry and to keep peoples power bills at a level they can afford
7727570 anti war activist stephen pearcy who gained attention from his sacramento home in february when he hung a human shaped form dressed in a military uniform and adorned it with anti war messages c
7727571 he was initially holding himself out as an anti war candidate someone who vehemently opposed the war and supported immediate withdrawal now i am not so sure he supports that this is an example of the kind of democrats weve had who have acted basically in a spineless manner
7727572 their experience and creative input will no doubt be instrumental to our continued growth expansion and the development of our operations in the greater china region as well as the rest of asia
7727573 mysmartsimulations has targeted 2008 to start addressing the government and military sectors our partnership with sri will help us better understand the needs of these segments we believe with sris experience mysmartsimulations inc will increase our presence in these sectors

7727580 the exports trend has eased in recent months following a period of strong growth in the second half of 2007
7727581 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7727582 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7727583 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7727584 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7727585 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7727586 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7727587 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7727588 being from atlanta i didnt know when id be able to enjoy the event now i have such a wonderful chance to actually be a part of the event

7727603 they deliberately trashed and broke things they deliberately threw ice cream and food from the freezer all over the floor they were real mean things to do
7727604 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7727605 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7727606 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7727607 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7727608 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7727609 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7727610 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7727611 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7727612 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament

7727623 you may ask why im posting their names why im trying to break a new zealand court order why im making a bit of a fool of myself well the answer is simple i am a staunch supporter of free speech and cannot stand the prevalence of pointless and suppressive limitations on speech especially on the internet
7727624 his judge harveys demonstrable idiocy is the new media equivalent of the spanish inquisition

7727632 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
7727633 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts

7727636 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7727637 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7727638 they want to see if there is any interest there
7727639 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7727640 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7727641 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7727642 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7727643 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7727644 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7727645 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7727646 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7727647 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7727648 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7727649 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat

7727659 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

7727676 it will cost an average family some 550 of additional taxes at a time when theyre struggling to pay their electricity bill their gasoline bill and a tax burden that is already one of the highest in the nation
7727677 that shouldnt surprise us charlie has already proposed an 18 billion tax increase on oil companies theres only one problem with that oil companies dont pay oil company taxes we consumers pay oil company taxes as they pass them along to us as higher prices
7727678 thats why the election is so important thats why the no tax pledge is so important and thats why charlie browns insistence on passing a budget with the second biggest tax increase in the history of california is so appalling and why its important to understand what it would do to our economy

7727768 she asked us to provide her direction on how she might structure the budget and bring it to us what revenue enhancements what cuts in city organizations what cuts in costs she could have
7727769 we did not approve any of the revenue enhancements that were proposed we did not have enough information to say yes or no on those and those are user paid fees from the development community
7727770 in 2008 we used some one time funds to make the budget work and those funds are not going to be available in 2009 so we have to cut that back along with some increased costs that we incurred in 2008 that were beyond our control

7727793 the bank has an even higher burden around fraud detection

7727818 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7727819 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7727820 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7727821 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7727822 the wind the wind just took the ones that were loose and just pulled them up there
7727823 i fell off the house so i didnt go back up there
7727824 the water was up on top of the deck behind you there
7727825 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7727826 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures anymore
7727827 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7727828 the world around me became crystal clear clear and real in a very surreal way everything appeared clean and perfect and i began to feel as if i were inside a doll house
7727829 while thujone usually occurs in greater concentrations in a absinthium the higher potency thujone is regarded as the primary psychoactive agent
7727830 my peripheral vision seems more like normal vision like where im not looking i am looking i can feel a fuzzy warm feeling around my body not inside but around me like a hazy glow has formed my vision also has a fuzziness to it but i can see quite clearly
7727831 a detectable to major inhibitory effect beyond that of the ethanol content
7727832 alcoholic delirium is characterized by hallucination almost always of a distressing kind is the patient given to absinthe then the symptomatology is different in absinthism the hallucination insanity is more active more terrifying sometimes provoking most dangerous reactions of extreme violence
7727833 i drank till the solid walls of my own room when at last i found myself there appeared to me like transparent glass shot through with emerald flame surrounded on all sides by phantoms beautiful hideous angelic devilish
7727834 the first stage is like ordinary drinking the second when you begin to see monstrous and cruel things but if you can persevere you will enter in upon a third stage where you will see things that you want to see wonderful and curious things
7727835 it is the thujone in wormwood that gives absinthe its hallucinogenic properties
7727836 the higher the thujone level the stronger the psychedelic effect
7727837 people want absinthe to be fearful stuff with the distinctive form of pleasure that fearful things bring
7727838 for me one of the principle attractions of absinthe is that by drinking it one is cocking a snook at new labours nanny culture
7727839 absinthe wont make you trip hallucinate cut your ear off or anything else you wouldnt ordinarily do when intoxicated with liquor
7727840 small ineffective doses may accumulate in the body to the point of having psychoactive and toxic effects if this is the case it validates absinthes reputation for producing an unusual intoxication
7727841 it seems reasonable to take reports of absinthes uniqueness with skepticism
7727842 if mr breaux has no thujone in his distillate absinthe it is because he had no thujone in his pot the wormwood must be fresh and of a good strain almost all of the commercially dried wormwood that ive tested were without virtue
7727843 based on anecdotal evidence from personal communications with absinthe distillers there appears to be an inverse correlation between length of drying time of the wormwood and the amount of thujone in the final distillate
7727844 less than 0 1 to 4 8 mg per gram of dried herb
7727845 obviously thujone free and therefore ideally suited to produce absinthe with wormwood quantities on the basis of the traditional recipes without the producer facing the risk of exceeding the thujone limit
7727846 what researchers actually show is that the thujone content of absinthe depends greatly on the specific type of wormwood used

7727870 the religion requirement is part of a recognition that a person with a college education ought to be acquainted with the role that religion plays in life and culture
7727871 the religion department is an academic department so we are interested in studying the variety of religions from the perspective of trying to see what they are about and what people do within them
7727872 we are not an advocacy group that advocates any particular religion
7727873 the third version looks at society and culture and how one can talk and learn about what religion is by looking at the roles that religion has played in human societies and cultures
7727874 students who are christian come who have done bible studies within their religious communities and are sometimes surprised because were asking a very different kind of question
7727875 were asking the question what can we learn about the nature of religion in ancient israel and early christianity by looking at this text
7727876 within a religious community there is a different question thats asked

7727889 hopefully weve kept a lot of construction traffic out of the middle of campus
7727890 i do have to say living in samuelson that the construction gets really loud in the morning
7727891 all the good things of this world are no farther good to us than they are for our use
7727892 king or emperor over the whole country which i had possession of
7727893 its all about fit and what kind of community we can offer that will be most comfortable or provide the most benefit
7727894 figs will provide a way for students to develop a connection to tcu
7727895 students who share a common interest can live together and develop friendships
7727896 its awesome tcu has a sophomore residency requirement because its one more year we can really do whatever we can to help students have whatever resources they need
7727897 one of the largest examples of green roof in north texas
7727898 tcu is collaborating with us on research to determine plants that will survive in north texas environments and the system that can be used to best support those plants
7727899 we went out into the field and looked at some really shallow plain communities that already exist because on a green roof generally you dont get to put more than 2 feet of soil
7727900 generally what you get is 4 inches so its very shallow
7727901 part of the reason green roofs keep the temperature down is from just the total amount of water being actually able to be in the soil
7727902 what happens is when the sun hits the roof it hits the soil and it evaporates out of the soil and when the plants are constantly pulling up the water through the roots system it actually has a cooling effect
7727903 make sure you find time to enjoy life and treasure the friendships you will make find a balance between school and fun and you will be much happier
7727904 make yourself go to class until spring break or thanksgiving so that you will get into routine
7727905 after that it wont seem hard to go to class
7727906 make the effort to really get to know your professors
7727907 they are great resources for your entire time at tcu and are more likely to help you if you have already made the effort to get to know them they are also useful for the tons of letters of recommendation you will need while at tcu
7727908 in college you are presented with many opportunities and trying to do them all will prove to be impossible
7727909 choose the things that you are most passionate about and want to fully invest yourself in say no to the rest only doing something with half your effort isnt worth your time
7727910 pot lucking could either be the best or worse thing
7727911 if it really bothers you then get your problems resolved if needed change room or roommate other than that enjoy it and get to know the person as much as you can
7727912 a planner one of the dorkiest things in high school right its not anymore
7727913 if youre like me and cant remember anything without writing it down please take my advice and go ahead and invest in some form of one youre in college now its ok to act professional
7727914 in life it is easy to be someone else but in college it is important to be yourself to distinguish yourself from other people and stand out among the crowd
7727915 anytime that you need a career adviser she would be the one that i would want to go to
7727916 she is the most inviting and comfortable presence that i have been a part of since i have been at tcu if she doesnt know the answer she will happily find it for you anytime anyway
7727917 mary and i used to meet every week and eat cookie dough together in frog bytes
7727918 she has really helped me to grow in my abilities here at career services
7727919 the is willing to make time to help me whether it be the randomest questions
7727920 i got help from her on my cover letter and resume
7727921 she gave me an overview of what i should or should not do she was able to provide a professional point of view
7727922 we still talk at least a couple of times a week
7727923 i just thank god for helping me get to the 100 and 200
7727924 i would have loved to make the semifinals but obviously at 50 meters i tightened up coming home after i ran a good curve that is something my coach taught me and i guess i just did the opposite
7727925 its my first olympics and i just need to get ready for the next one
7727926 i am excited because the beijing olympics were amazing for me
7727927 i improved my time going from 1 03 74 to 1 03 72 in the 100 breast when i arrived first in my heat i looked up to the screen and saw myself i was so happy that i improved my time and that i did well
7727928 it was important to come out and set the tone for the rest of the season
7727929 i thought we made a commitment to come out on the attack and put them on their heels we had been stressing that we need to make a commitment to what we are doing
7727930 its more important for our kids to get some confidence in them
7727931 its good to have freshman forward jordan calhoun and karoly confident and knowing they can do what they need to do
7727932 she has set a standard now for the rest of her college career abdalla said
7727933 if she can get two goals a game we will be in pretty good shape she has been training unbelievably hard it was good to see her get rewarded and it was good to see her composure
7727934 i just wanted to come out strong play hard and score some goals
7727935 our goal is to be at our top level of performance when we get to conference
7727936 we might have a couple bumps in the road in some of these early games but they are just going to work and get better in every game
7727937 everyone tries really hard at practice to fight for a spot
7727938 the incoming freshmen have come in and added a lot to this team
7727939 hopefully i can pass what i have learned to the younger ones
7727940 its important for the whole team to know that she can come up with the one or two saves that we need to make it a game
7727941 hit up the office of religious and spiritual life thats a good place to start
7727942 i myself am a humanist so i am particularly happy to speak to students who dont fall into the category of christian
7727943 some of them may have the term reverend or father but it doesnt mean that theyre close minded
7727944 if you need a space to worship thats private and with your own type of ceremony and it doesnt endanger anybody we offer that space to everybody
7727945 weve made it very comprehensive we list all of our programs and when they meet we list links to places of worship and resources like books and stuff you might want to look up
7727946 when we did the spring break trip we had an atheist we had a daoist we had a buddhist
7727947 so it depends on the program but this is a pleasantly diverse group and its encouraging to see people that are brave enough to come out and share their faith but share it in a context that works toward unity and peace
7727948 its important to represent all the different religions and beliefs on campus since were a minority i think its important that every jewish student join this organization
7727949 tcu is really small and i pretty much know all the indian students at tcu
7727950 they just cant live on salads everyday or cheese pizzas i would suggest to them to be prepared and to know how to cook
7727951 to tell you the truth i love temple food vegetarian based it is a lot better than regular tcu food
7727952 im a big texas country guy and i really like steve earle
7727953 sometimes guys see going to the bullpen as a demotion but i think hes done a good job of accepting that role and flourishing in it
7727954 i had never really been able to throw a breaking ball
7727955 i think ive really picked up on my slider and ive been able to throw my slider really well this year
7727956 mentally hes grown to be really strong where he can handle his emotions
7727957 he expects positive things to happen and he doesnt dwell on the negative and thats important because hes always pitching in pressure situations
7727958 its up to him whether he signs or not but if he keeps doing what hes doing hell be a high draft pick
7727959 if he doesnt fall where he wants to fall well welcome him back
7727960 as of right now im coming back to tcu but well see what happens this summer
7727961 im looking to go first or second round but if it doesnt work out then ill be back here
7727962 if theres a chance of going hunting im going hunting
7727963 ive been put in games in close situations and i like getting the ball when the games on the line because i can pretty much control what i can do as far as throwing off the mound
7727964 visit 57 times in one day and eat all you can
7727965 hes more talkative with his players than dougherty and he shows you how to exactly do the work step by step
7727966 if there was a word that was past intense that im not intelligent enough to come to grips with thats what he is
7727967 he wants to win he wants guys that are going to play hard and just spill their guts but he does a good job balancing hes got two complete personalities
7727968 hes the type of guy that if youre not doing the right things hes not going to beat around the bush hell tell you straight up and i like that about coaches
7727969 every day the challenges change but its about getting the kids to believe that they can be a special basketball team and getting them to do the things that are necessary to do that
7727970 its something that even if things dont go your way for one day or one game you have to stay the course if those kids develop that its going to be a fun year
7727971 i want us to compete on every possession to make it difficult for the other team but offensively i want to give a few guys freedom to play ball basketball is supposed to be fun and i want these kids to have fun playing it
7727972 you can shoot 0 for 10 and play 40 minutes for jim but if you dont dive on a loose ball youll never see the floor
7727973 hell live with the mistakes but the effort is non negotiable
7727974 i think i learned so much about the recruiting process there because you had to recruit so many people and you had to try to find the ones that could fit there
7727975 it was a place where i kind of cut my teeth and the lessons i learned from being there carried me through
7727976 where your ties are really isnt important its all about people its all about hard work and its all about developing relationships
7727977 vamos a esperar que el gobierno y el grupo espa ol marsans negocien esa situaci n
7727978 cuando haya una tasaci n oficial de los organismos competentes y cuando se determine el precio el proyecto tiene que volver a la c mara de diputados y al senado
7727979 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7727980 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7727981 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7727982 this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every american north south east west young old will have decent quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege
7727983 we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and finally yes we will
7727984 he is a man who always insists that america live up to its highest ideals who always fights for what he knows is right and who is always there for others
7727985 i love to death hes just a good man and obviously he is going through a tough time
7727986 he is being honored tonight because he is a giant not only to the democratic party but in the american political landscape
7727987 there are very few people who can point to more concrete accomplishments that have made a real difference in the lives of ordinary folks than ted kennedy
7727988 to keep the show fresh and make it a bit more unpredictable again
7727989 if i feel i need to be hard with someone to get that across i will be if i need to be softer or more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that
7727990 beautifully honest she will not mince words i dont think shell be mean for the sake of being mean
7727991 has a real intuitive gut thing i think shes a perfect judge for this shes no nonsense shes a new york girl who went to l a shell be frank and honest and decidedly experienced she calls it like she sees it
7727992 im just going to speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7727993 im going to have my opinion be honest i dont foresee any problems
7727994 shes just probably wondering what could or could not happen just like anybody would
7727995 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7727996 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7727997 well msnbc dude its because for centuries you folks havent seemed to grasp the fact that were americans just like you
7727998 were fortunate to not only have found this gene but to be able to do something about it
7727999 because wed been struggling for a good bit of this year we put the showdown completely out of mind and didnt even think of it when we started ripping off some really good qualifying efforts throughout the summer
7728000 its a great event and it adds a whole extra days worth of drama to the mac tools u s nationals but not having been in it for two years i kind of just put it out of my head it wasnt until brainerd just a couple of weeks ago that it became pretty clear we had a chance to pull this deal off but we still needed just about everything to go right in reading
7728001 we somehow did it so im pretty pumped about that but now it comes down to putting good laps on the board and not worrying about the math
7728002 what can really shape the showdown is the weather since its run during the day on sunday as a race team weve actually won it twice with frankie pedregon winning for us in 2001 and both times weve won the big money it came on a hot and sunny day a tricky track is the big equalizer and when you get out there on a hot day with a scalding track it doesnt really matter how much horsepower you can generate you need to find a way to get from a to b
7728003 i know there are some teams out here who would like that kind of money but dont really need it
7728004 we are definitely not one of those teams it meant a lot to us from my dad and me right down to the youngest crew guy the team benefitted a great deal by the money and all of our guys got a piece of it too
7728005 that monday having to win four rounds to make it all pay off was probably the single most stressful day of racing ive ever experienced it was suffocating at times and the racing was pretty fierce but we managed to pull it off and to this day its kind of hard to believe i promise you in some ways it feels like a long time ago because weve been through so much since that day but in more ways it feels like yesterday i think all of the guys who were there can remember that last lap in tiny detail including the celebration after it it was a huge day for worsham racing csk auto and especially our friends at mac tools theyve been with us for 11 years and they loved that day as much as we did
7728006 of course we can do it i know were capable of it the car is running well and weve raced well at indy for a lot of years that being said winning either of the two big events is just enormous and really harder than you can imagine so its a really tough thing to do if we follow the plan if we tune the car and bolt it together right and if the driver does his job we can win it all but you wont win it all by looking too far ahead its one step at a time thats how we did it in 05 focusing on each individual lap and not thinking about the whole big thing until we had no choice on the very last lap so well just take it one step at a time
7728007 pretty interesting how music sales only contribute 43 of the
7728008 if u have anything negative to say about this song
7728009 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that
7728010 colonizing a continent isnt easy colonizing a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early
7728011 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7728012 there have been many instances where the staff turned down an appeal and the reinstatement committee reversed it
7728013 while we would have appreciated a staff ruling that would have put him on the field tomorrow we are grateful for the opportunity to be heard on thursday
7728014 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in

7728026 run dont walk to the bobbi brown make up counter and get a professional to cover it
7728027 there is no such thing as innocence only degrees of guilt
7728028 shit miss mary i aint the only one who dont got no root
7728029 i really dont like calling you its always the wrong time
7728030 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7728031 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7728032 i hate to jump on this bandwagon but katie holmes pre season football feel the excitement
7728033 wow thats amazing that your mother aunt and grandmother were all born on the same day
7728034 shes my mother but shes my cousins aunt and my kids grandmother
7728035 so funny that theyre all born on the same day
7728036 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7728037 k ci told the audience that they were tired after their 24 hour flight and that jojo had gotten dizzy
7728038 its the jodeci sound but if you heard our second and the last half of hotel its like the bridge between the second and third albums theres 17 cuts its a double cd
7728039 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7728040 i sent him a review copy of my book and some other neat stuff and i enclosed a note that said im a late bloomer

7728042 you dont understand im a late bloomer im not 20 or even 30 i dont have decades to build a career this is it for me i need my cell phone back oprah is only going to buzz me once no answer and its over
7728043 an agnostic insomniac with dyslexia sits up all night pondering the existance of dog
7728044 taking over the points lead is huge because you get the 20 point bonus for being no 1
7728045 im just glad to be able to run for a championship again were going to try and win every race that we can if we can get far enough ahead of everybody then its going to be hard for them to all catch us
7728046 weve been flirting with a win now for a while and it feels wonderful to get it done
7728047 the main thing is that we want to carry momentum into indy and then the playoffs and theres no better way to build up momentum than to go out there and turn on the win light the closer we are to the no 1 spot when the playoffs start the better it will be we moved up to third with our reading win and we could mathematically get as high as second in indy so thats what well try to do weve been talking about getting that look back in our eye and i think we did that a little bit in reading
7728048 indys been known as the granddaddy of them all and has been the biggest event on the nhra tour for more than 50 years
7728049 to have an indy win under your belt is very special we have been fortunate to have had a lot of success at indy as a family over the years and i look forward to doing what i can to continue that tradition this season as a family our overall win record there is pretty darn stout for me its a trophy that ranks right up there with the powerade championship trophy for sure
7728050 indy is the race where you must have all your is dotted and ts crossed going in there and as a result of that there have been quite a few multiple time winners
7728051 everybody comes to indy with their guns loaded as heavy as they can from a chassis and engine standpoint as well as from a mental standpoint its just a marathon race with an extra day of racing and as a driver you have to be prepared for that
7728052 were treating indy as the first race of the countdown to 1
7728053 its the biggest race of the year and we want to win indy were going into that race as best prepared as we can weve got to get momentum on our side and never look back there are so many great teams this year that i dont think anyone is going to run away with the championship in a six race stretch once the countdown to 1 begins we think its going to take three wins in the last six races to win the powerade championship its going to be a lot of fun therell be a lot of holeshot wins and some exciting racing
7728054 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7728055 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7728056 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7728057 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7728058 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7728059 were grateful to the foodies and fishers who have signed our pledge to help stop shark finning and we invite the new zealand public to also sign the pledge and help save our sharks
7728060 on balance and given the very significant changes that we have achieved we have decided it is better to make a start than to do nothing and so we have told the government this morning we will vote for a scheme that proceeds on the basis of what we have negotiated so far
7728061 we have won 1 billion to insulate and upgrade new zealand homes to make them warm and dry and to keep peoples power bills at a level they can afford
7728062 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
7728063 our lady used to actually write to our little healthy lifestyles group at zila in arizona personally
7728064 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7728065 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7728066 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7728067 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7728068 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7728073 lets remind everyone this is a video game and not a hockey simulation
7728074 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a
7728075 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7728076 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7728077 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7728078 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7728079 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7728080 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7728081 nada me iba a mantener alejado de este compartir especial

7728090 imagine if thered been some sort of hideous pentagon mess up and someone had decided that the army would go into battle driving a fleet of camrys so why in the name of all thats holy is it somehow acceptable to cruise down to the mall in a military vehicle

7728094 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7728095 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7728096 our lineup has changed since the lineup was out there so we were looking at the lineup card to see where we were all at unfortunately we didnt pull it out

7728103 measles was so commonplace it was estimated that many cases did not get reported so well just pull an extremely large number out of our hat and give it a margin for error of a million
7728104 because of the growing demand for our product and services and with the success of our initial call we felt this was the perfect time to allow individuals to get involved
7728105 we also know many people are beginning to look for jobs more locally to subsidize the rising cost of gas
7728106 this is not just an opportunity to make money it is an opportunity to make a difference
7728107 we have provided a vehicle for individuals to help their families friends their communities etc by offering the companys inventory know how to the general public we have moved our knowledge of inventory from the warehouse to the living room
7728108 this is an excellent way to subsidize an income or to earn a living

7728116 bisa saja pengguna elpiji 12 kg beralih ke elpiji 3 kg yang harganya rp 16 000 per tabung kalau dihitung hitung membeli empat tabung elpiji 3 kg berarti keluar uang rp 64 000 sedangkan elpiji ukuran 12 kg harganya rp 75 000 masih ada selisih rp 11 000 dan itu cukup besar artinya
7728117 dari kemarin belum juga diantar dari 75 tabung yang ada di sini 70 tabung kosong
7728118 pelanggan kami para pedagang gorengan dan ibu rumah tangga marah marah
7728119 kalau rp 75 000 konsumen pada komplain naik rp 4 000 saja udah pada protes
7728120 kami yang berhadapan langsung dengan konsumen selalu diprotes karena harga naik terus
7728121 itu pun jarang yang beli beda dengan tabung 3 kg karena harga elpijinya tetap harga tabungnya naik dari rp 120 000 menjadi rp 140 000
7728122 prediksi saya konsumen elpiji 12 kg beralih ke elpiji 3 kg karena harga elpiji 3 kg tidak naik
7728123 we took the kids in to change their uniforms and when i came out to get some things from the van somebody had busted the lock and cleaned us out

7728128 we wanted to be very involved these are our brands they have great meaning for us as a company and have stood the test of time its about igniting the passion of the fans as well as new generations of kids and collectors for our brands are really beloved and played with the world over
7728129 we think there is a tremendous upside in the movie and taking the brand to the next level and exposing the idea behind transformers which is the more than meets the eye concept to a new generation of adults and kids it celebrates what they were at the very core

7728142 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7728143 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7728144 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7728145 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7728146 dealing with the enormous problems and concerns about global warming may be the biggest challenge of our generation
7728147 the only way to deal with this challenge is to focus our energy and intellectual capital
7728148 anything funded through rates is a concern for us especially in the economic conditions were in now were seeing more and more shut offs and expect the situation to get worse

7728152 we do not restrict access to our exams for anyone applying for initial certification or maintenance of certification based on whether they do or do not perform an abortion
7728153 we do not base this upon whether they do or do not refer patients to an abortion provider if they do not choose to do abortions
7728154 the potential to force physicians to either violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionable actions or risk losing their board certification
7728155 both shocked and very dismayed at the grossly untrue and unfair allegation
7728156 action by the american board of obstetrics and gynecology had the potential to force physicians to either violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionalbe actions or risk losing their board certification
7728157 the american board of obstetrics and gynecology has taken no stand pro or con against individual physicians who choose to or choose not to perform abortions or to refer patients to abortion providers
7728158 intent and full implications of any proposed regulations governing conscience rights may be fully understood
7728159 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7728160 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7728161 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president

7728169 approximately 30 of the redundancies affect editorial staff in australia and new zealand and for new zealand this includes staff already affected by the previously announced editorial project in subediting
7728170 most areas of the business including editorial publishing services marketing and newspaper sales the contact centres and the editorial library
7728171 reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial to ensure optimal employment of staff and technology and including outsourcing of elements that will not impact our quality position as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
7728172 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7728173 ensure the continuing productivity and growth of the age in both a financial sense and as a business model to truly support us becoming an integrated media company we are now moving from a transition of our business into a transformation of our business
7728174 a deferral of wage reviews for senior management a reduction in our overall marketing spend a refinement of our interstate newspaper sales program a reduction in fringe benefits such as taxi use parking and canteen subsidies
7728175 via redundancy programs following reviews of operating and support processes in all departments on the corporate and business side as well as editorial
7728176 its in all our interests that we do this professionally over a short period of time we will get through this and we will focus on supporting the people affected by this announcement and we will also focus on keeping the age strong through and beyond this transformation
7728177 we find the decision extremely disappointing and symbolic of fairfaxs low cost discounted approach to journalism based on the company email it would seem 120 positions are under threat at the smh and the age which is 8 10 of journalists on those papers
7728178 clearly as they are already under resourced the quality will be further discounted its bad news for journalists and the company and especially bad news for the communities served by those papers
7728179 its at odds with other news publications to invest in low cost discounted approach to journalism which is the wrong approach to take at this time ultimately it means that readers and other fairfax publications are the losers
7728180 from the creative standpoint its not a real accomplishment to come up with something like that to be proud of
7728181 i wouldnt call it that at all hes moving forward but were still trying to build a foundation for him he hasnt played in the majors in 10 weeks its part of the process hes been building up we want to find that mixture of work days batting practice whatever it might be and playing
7728182 he feels good early in the game but he needs to feel better later in the game he didnt swing a bat for a long time but he definitely feels better than he did before
7728183 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president

7728185 confident but not cocky a team player who improves the game of those around him and he will not back down
7728186 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7728187 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7728188 the same man she fell in love with 19 years ago
7728189 its going to be harder because theres going to be more burden put on the police officers in documentation and work theyre going to have to do in the station

7728191 karratha and newman are both key mining destinations where we believe we can bring some great advantages in terms of schedule reliability and competitive fares

7728197 the nsw premier has apparently sent an email to all public servants saying that the nsw public service would be shut down for a fortnight at christmas so that a the nsw public service could wipe out a chunk of accrued leave on its books and b so that staff could spend more time with their families it goes without saying that staff will be compelled to use up part of their annual leave
7728198 confident that wydca will deliver royal randwick back to us in good condition
7728199 as they can be reminded of hungary in 56 and czechoslovakia in 68
7728200 so whats so good about the worlds biggest radio telescope
7728201 i feel abandoned i need to be rescued i need love and kindness
7728202 so the question now is how fast can we expand our network to reach these customers
7728203 now that we know where the interest for wimax is we will be rolling out our services more aggressively
7728204 instead of just 1mbps we are offering 1 2mbps which means consumers are getting better value for their money
7728205 we will continue to monitor our pricing strategy to ensure that w1max reaches as many malaysians as possible
7728206 we are working with intel to bring in wimax chip embedded notebooks and these will probably be on the market next year
7728207 the wimax movement will not stop because setting up a network is as easy as plug and play
7728208 australia provided a lot of the coaching talent at the games for other successful countries they talk about wind assisted sprints im surprised nobody here has yet produced a medal ranking for aussie assisted medals

7728216 this is the third wave of business improvement initiatives we have undertaken over the past three years

7728218 the abcs most recently retired director ron brunton claims the public broadcasters staff and management deceived lied to and withheld information from the board to stop changes being made to the culture of the abc dr brunton a conservative anthropologist says the board was treated with such contempt that in 2003 he was made to sign a statement he was not sure was correct in his second year the annual report was printed containing assertions i do not accept before being shown to him

7728220 i dont think so because he will be the smartest kid in his class
7728221 well you need to pick the berries first we charge by the pound
7728222 listen i grew up in scottsdale cut me a little slack here
7728223 after 21 years of successfully raising funds for good causes we wanted to ensure that our image reflects a new and more dynamic national lottery
7728224 we carried out research on our existing brand it was seen as reliable but dull and dated
7728225 we came up with options that would bring more fun to the brand and the one that came up most from talking to the players and agents was the star
7728226 the star represents possibilities and fulfilling a dream maybe even bringing dreams to life
7728227 the lottery stands and terminals were in need of replacement anyhow and had long since passed their purpose we should have all the new stands and terminals completed by early september
7728228 the external signage outside the stores should be fully completed by the end of september
7728229 the lotto characters or lotto lads familiar from the tv ads are set to stay for the foreseeable future they give continuity from the old brand to the new
7728230 for future major road construction projects fine gael wants all roads to remain in public ownership so that the massive waste of taxpayers money and congestion problems associated with the west link will never happen again
7728231 the private sector can still design build finance maintain and even operate tolls but operational control needs to remain with the government
7728232 the taxpayers have already paid 500m for the west link and are now being fleeced on the double
7728233 a toll is only supposed to be introduced if there is a viable alternative road until the outer orbital route is introduced no such alternative exists
7728234 a ppp is a fancy way of financing roads to keep them off the balance sheet but will prove more costly
7728235 tolls are an extremely inefficient way of raising revenue and have all sorts of negative consequences
7728236 we need proper procedures to protect players this isnt just about john its about any player who sustains an injury like this in an off the ball incident
7728237 he has no recollection of the final 10 minutes or of the point he scored during that time he also took a few more heavy belts we are asking for the matter to be fully investigated
7728238 all he wants to do is play for his club and his county but when something like this happens it makes you wonder whats going on in the gaa
7728239 there are procedures in place and we will adhere to them the first step in that process is to consider the referees report
7728240 men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other
7728241 those who are kind to the cruel will be cruel to the kind
7728242 but that day belongs to the lord the lord almighty a day of vengeance for vengeance on his foes
7728243 when they kept questioning jesus he straightened up and said to them if any of you is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone at her
7728244 do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people but love your neighbor as yourself
7728245 for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank i your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye
7728246 these people killed someone they deserve to die for it

7728251 i got to spend the afternoon today thursday august 21 at
7728252 i will tell you that no one but no one leashes
7728253 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7728254 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7728255 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7728256 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7728257 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7728258 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7728259 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7728260 if the only tool you have is a hammer you tend to see every problem as a nail

7728286 hillary clinton was doggedly determined to see this through to the end
7728287 i think that determination you can still find among some of her supporters
7728288 there was a lot of passion and energy that was tied up in her campaign but she has said if you believed in me then you must believe in sen
7728289 it might take a little time for some people to come around

7728344 no es un boliche simplemente es una casa de reuniones donde el vino y la cerveza corren como r os mientras la m sica suena sin tregua

7728352 una f cil empresa si quisiera propon rsela le bastar a dedicar anualmente una suma relativamente modesta y entregarla a quienes son capaces de realizar la obra
7728353 el xito econ mico es a menudo incompatible con una empresa cultural de largo aliento que en su iniciaci n carece generalmente de popularidad
7728354 atenuar el excesivo privilegio de unas pocas localidades del pa s en que se acumula la casi totalidad del caudal bibliogr fico con que ste cuenta
7728355 hace menos que imposible la vida intelectual en la mayor parte de aquel
7728356 esta distribuci n del tesoro bibliogr fico no solamente es injusta sino altamente inconveniente pues favorece ese tan perjudicial proceso de condensaci n de nuestra poblaci n en unos pocos centros urbanos la circulaci n del libro proyectada por usted tendr a en nuestra vida espiritual una funci n an loga a la de la sangre en el organismo

7728360 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7728361 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7728362 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7728363 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7728364 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay
7728365 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7728366 anomia esa es la palabra que define la realidad que vivimos los tucumanos frente a esta singular forma de gobierno que inaugur el matrimonio alperovich en el 2003
7728367 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7728368 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7728369 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7728370 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7728371 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7728372 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7728373 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7728374 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7728375 if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7728376 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another

7728381 a veces se cree que en internet uno puede encontrar toda la informaci n pero la riqueza de poder preguntar de intercambiar informaci n de llevarse un folleto que despu s se lee tranquilo en la casa o se comparte con los padres o los compa eros y de informarse en un cara a cara es irremplazable para poder elegir la carrera que se va a seguir

7728386 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7728387 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7728388 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7728389 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7728390 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7728391 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night

7728408 generalmente en las empresas se presentan c rculos de empleados de cierta edad cuyo lema es el no se puede hay que romper con ese esquema que lleva a la mediocridad y automotivarse permanentemente

7728410 lo fundamental es repasar las metas que uno se traz de ser necesario descubrir qu es lo que mejor hace en su profesi n
7728411 el quid de la cuesti n pasa por darse cuenta sin ayuda externa que ese trabajador pasa el tiempo disfrutando de lo que hace ese es el talento en estado natural
7728412 si uno cree que tiene las energ as o las pilas suficientes para aprender todos los d as adelante eso contribuir a afianzar sus proyectos personales y su misi n no importa la edad que tenga
7728413 el optimismo allana el camino hacia el logro tomando un proyecto el empleo como una oportunidad y no como una resistencia un obst culo permanente por lo cotidiano

7728421 the post shows a photograph of the two men and dubs judge harveys decision an
7728422 you may ask why im posting their names why im trying to break a new zealand court order why im making a bit of a fool of myself well the answer is simple i am a staunch supporter of free speech and cannot stand the prevalence of pointless and suppressive limitations on speech especially on the internet
7728423 his judge harveys demonstrable idiocy is the new media equivalent of the spanish inquisition
7728424 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7728425 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process
7728426 theres been a trend the past two or three years for women to buy chocolates for themselves as a sort of pat on the back for having worked hard
7728427 you have married a wonderful girl i want you to know you are now our family too
7728428 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a
7728429 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7728430 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7728431 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7728432 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7728433 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7728434 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7728435 we are for some reason continuing to knock holes in that remaining urban grid the hotel sierra site the old circular gas station at atwells and broadway the old public safety complex the one ten westminster site grants lot what is next the arcade
7728436 i suspect that in many ways the city is encouraging unadulterated demolition developers can bring financially shaky proposals to the table knowing full well that if their financing falls through theyll be allowed to park cars on the vacant lot the procaccianti group has even gone so far as to cry financial hardship about the minimum landscape requirements for a surface lot the city needs to start defending itself against these sorts of predatory developers
7728437 this is about using state of the art technology to hold ourselves accountable while keeping residents informed every step of the way as we work to improve the delivery of city services
7728438 qalert also provides us with a clearer understanding of constituents needs so that we can make smarter decisions about deploying resources

7728441 yo bailo tango desde hace seis a os y cuando prepar bamos un espect culo era o en clave de sainete teatral o con m sica y baile abordando diferentes estilos ahora cruzamos diferentes lenguajes de manera experimental
7728442 la idea fue integrar distintos elementos de manera natural dejando que fluyan dentro de un lenguaje marcado por el tango uniendo vivencias y sonidos
7728443 cuando salimos los fines de semana vamos a la milonga no al boliche y compartimos muchos con gente de la vieja guardia del tango peor tambi n con la nueva
7728444 me pasa como profesora que llegan chicos pidiendo bailar tango electr nico y al tiempo descubren el tradicional y se enamoran m s todav a estas son las cosas que mantienen vivo al tango que le dan vida y alegr a
7728445 buscamos sonidos de todas las tendencias del tango y buscamos mostrar el origen marginal recurriendo a sonidos diferentes pero de la misma ra z como la murga y el hip hop
7728446 no queremos montar un espect culo que repita las vivencias del conventillo de principios del siglo pasado sino ver c mo se vive el tango ahora
7728447 well you find out and bring me the number ill be outside okay sweetheart
7728448 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
7728449 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7728450 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7728451 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7728452 it needs to be dealt with because i lost most of the feeling in my right arm and am having pain in my shoulder
7728453 im losing 20 percent of my strength per day if i dont do anything about it the injury will end up rupturing and then the surgery will be more difficult its not easy because surgery never is
7728454 its a different injury than the pectoral tear because that was more of a muscle injury this is concerning my bones which has a lot less blood flow than muscle tissue it also has to do with my neck which is a very fragile area
7728455 every moment i stay away from the table is another moment something bad can happen the disk is so bulged out and inflamed that any sudden move could make it worse
7728456 you can either do one or two things you can be upset or pout or you can know what to do to get better
7728457 im already in the mode of getting the surgery as quick as i can
7728458 in the last ten months ive really focused on functional strength training and im stronger than ive ever been my goal is to talk to the neurosurgeon about how quickly i can get back to full throttle training and getting back into the ring and thats the ultimate goal to be strong as i can and get back into the ring as soon as possible
7728459 quality is very important to us and since so many people visit the google com homepage we wanted to make sure to evaluate and refine our algorithms to provide a good experience using google suggest
7728460 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7728461 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7728462 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7728463 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7728464 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7728469 ive never been in business class let alone first class i got a proper bed and duvet but i only drank orange juice on the flight home
7728470 im certain that wont be the case in a months time
7728471 no one will want to be talking as i set off for training at five in the morning
7728472 i most want to get a kit deal so that i dont keep buying equipment for swimming i owe my parents a lot of money so any sponsorship is going to help them a lot more than me
7728473 and i might drop down to try the 200 i might have a go at all three it all depends on how i develop as an athlete
7728474 ill be 23 next time which is a great age to be but after that i want to do other stuff mark fosters the crazy guy who keeps going but ill want to do something else go to university
7728475 because she was so determined to do it herself it was never a case of me pushing her

7728477 bw jayleen 1918 is a well appointed centrally located hotel that serves the business and leisure markets equally comprehensively
7728478 we are very excited to enter the singapore market at a time when it offers visitors so much in the way of entertainment and activities based on its strong and stable economy but this is only the beginning we plan to continue expanding in this market just as we are expanding throughout the asian region
7728479 i will never hesitate to look for where we can become more efficient and where we can make reductions
7728480 but i think we can say 8 million in program cuts if it were only done that way would have a significant impact on our kids
7728481 this virtually gives the board a blank check from all of madisons taxpayers checkbooks
7728482 it may very well allow the school board members to never have to do the heavy lifting of developing a real long term cost saving
7728483 why would they jeopardize the good will that they are already developing with the public
7728484 something different in terms of confidence that theyre doing something different that theyre working to get information theyre not just taking them for granted
7728485 were the first ones to have it out in the industry and were thinking green now
7728486 for our customers diesel is over 4 a gallon so they can recognize some significant savings
7728487 as a representative of the 18 million voters who supported her clinton there are still several of us who are either going to support mccain or not vote at all
7728488 im speaking out because i want others to feel that they are able to speak out that they can come out and say they are going to support a candidate who has the judgment and experience to make tough decisions during this most difficult time
7728489 i think the mccain campaign will run with this as far as they can but the american and wisconsin people are pretty clear that shes one person and the democratic party is coming together with great unity
7728490 we hope and expect that bill clinton will give a stirring and perfectly acceptable speech by broadcast standards
7728491 however if we see his face turning red and his forehead starting to throb well be there to pull the plug
7728492 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7728493 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7728494 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7728495 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7728496 every time we make the decision to love someone we open ourselves to great suffering because those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain the greatest pain comes from leaving when the child leaves home when the husband or wife leaves for a long period of time or for good when the beloved friend departs to another country or dies the pain of the leaving can tear us apart still if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving we will never experience the joy of loving and love is stronger than fear life stronger than death hope stronger than despair we have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking
7728497 its about engagement with young people and with the wider community
7728498 its also about what engineering is the importance of it and to simply excite some interest in it
7728499 we have to make it fun for them but not talk down to them we want it to be serious fun
7728500 you could say theyre on a waiting list for mars
7728501 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a
7728502 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems

7728536 theres a lot more interest because of the obama clinton thing clinton won the popular vote obama won the delegates so its just interesting to watch the dynamics of these folks
7728537 i dont think theres tension between the delegates not that ive observed anyways
7728538 in talking with the clinton supporters in the delegation there still some sense of intense disappointment i havent heard anyone say they arent going to stop obama when its all done but they were really looking forward to being clinton supporting delegates and nominating for the first time a female candidate for president
7728539 it is embarrassing to the state and embarrassing to himself he has no solutions i am not surprised by the results

7728558 while i am aware that there are laws on the books in canada australia and europe that prohibit investigation of the talmud and make it a crime to criticize rabbinic texts a ukrainian editor is the most recent target of such prosecution i was under the impression that it was still legal in america to criticize the talmud perhaps amazon com knows something i dont
7728559 as far as being inappropriate and questionable im not sure how that would warrant interdiction of a polemical work of comparative religion in twenty first century america
7728560 the old romans observed the fate of the work illustrates its argument in the case of the embargo on my book by amazon the long arm of rabbinic power and influence over a major corporation is on display for the all the world to see

7728563 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7728564 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7728565 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7728566 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7728567 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7728568 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7728569 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7728570 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market mr heffernan said
7728571 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over 1 to 1 5 per cent
7728572 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year mr heffernan said
7728573 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so
7728574 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight he told more than 4000 cheering delegates
7728575 my idea is that its the faculty issues that are supposed to lead discussion
7728576 theres nothing out there that i think we want to say this is our agenda
7728577 because i think we need to be more fluid we need to see what are the issues that our faculty the faculty at eastern they want to address
7728578 it always happens usually in february or march which doesnt give us much time to make any changes or come out with concrete suggestions
7728579 this year were going to try to have the faculty forum in november so that it does give us time in the spring to address some of the issues that come up
7728580 we had a consultant come in and analyze the coverage of the sound and the coordination of the sound from the three locations
7728581 weve worked through new student orientation to let the students know about this
7728582 you have to keep reminding people of these systems so they know when they hear a siren or a pulse tone that they need to react
7728583 the new sirens are designed to alert the community about potential life threatening situations including active shooter situations bomb threats and the like
7728584 when we think of emergency preparedness its more than just the kind of things we think about in terms of an active shooter on campus like virginia tech and niu
7728585 its also tornados it could be an explosion an electrical transformer could blow up we could have an explosion in a laboratory in a science building
7728586 we try to get multiple coverage to get multiple contacts
7728587 last year in the summer we were having to let people know if they were going to get paid
7728588 the fact that the governor did not veto those increases is very positive
7728589 i believe the attitude toward higher education is a positive one
7728590 it certainly helps but it doesnt go as far as we like
7728591 we decided to move forward without state money and we are trying to see if that is going to be feasible or not
7728592 this will probably be the largest project that we have ever undertaken
7728593 well do everything we can to keep it going but i dont want to say that no questions no problems that it is going to last because we had two catastrophic failures last year
7728594 when the opportunity to serve in this role presented itself i was both excited and challenged
7728595 i felt this was a unique opportunity for me to serve eastern and have the chance to work in an area for which i have a passion
7728596 i had a very positive experience as an undergraduate sorority member
7728597 my membership led me to become involved on campus in a wide variety of activities that i doubt i would have sought out otherwise
7728598 i think many students dont think about the fact that joining a fraternity or a sorority is truly a lifelong commitment and i have met so many amazing young women who are a part of phi sigma sigma from all over the country and canada through my volunteer roles
7728599 our chapters serve as places where students can develop their leadership abilities through serving as officers and chairs and learn how to plan and implement events of all types as well as many other skills
7728600 many students have found that easterns fraternities and sororities have met those desires for what they look for when seeking to become part of an organization
7728601 i decided i wanted to find a masters program where i could combine my love for living on campus and working with fraternities and sororities
7728602 i didnt originally plan to stay on at eastern but each year as i have interviewed for positions at other campuses and at eastern the opportunities here have been the best fit for me
7728603 the vacancy occurred late spring and it was too late to conduct an external search
7728604 because it was incredibly important to have a plan of action for covering responsibilities as soon as possible i decided to conduct a search within the division of student affairs
7728605 she has an excellent background in advising fraternity and sorority organizations and is very familiar with the eiu campus and culture
7728606 there was no doubt in my mind that robyn was the perfect person to serve as interim director
7728607 those guys make sacrifices and at best we can maybe provide them with tuition if theyre going to school but otherwise those guys have to come in and spend their own money for room and board
7728608 a lot of that credit goes to barbara burke ken baker and the administration from last year committing all the dollars they did to summer school
7728609 it was unprecedented anybody who wanted to take summer school basically got aid to go to summer school that helped keep most all of them around
7728610 what youre always trying to achieve is a team cohesion if you will
7728611 i think the best way to do that is to be around your teammates and go through the same struggles theyre going through on a daily basis
7728612 the freshmen that were here in the summer are light years ahead of the freshmen that werent here in the summer
7728613 i think we can expect some of them to contribute because they were here from a physical standpoint its obvious the guys that were here this summer have made tremendous improvements in the first two fall practices you could see theyre better football players better athletes
7728614 it means you better be working hard because there are guys behind you that really want to play
7728615 the freshman class right now is as talented as any freshman class that ive been here for
7728616 team building and team bonding is definitely going to be there because we all know each other and were all comfortable with each other
7728617 obviously playing two bcs bowl teams is a huge challenge
7728618 a possible upset is always in my mind were all up for the challenge
7728619 dollars are very important to us as were trying to build this program back to what it was in the 60s and 70s
7728620 we might as well just play the packers the packers and the packers
7728621 all four are very good its good for us id rather play a tough schedule early it helps toward the end of the year thats been my experience throughout im not going to ever change that theory or thought
7728622 its a ton of fun to get to go do that and go compete with the best
7728623 at the same time its going to prepare us once we see that speed then we come back to conference and it kind of slows down a little bit so its definitely going to help us prepare
7728624 i think theres not only a physical but a mental aspect that helps you out
7728625 for us starting at that level of competition and easing our way down is going to be very beneficial and its going to prepare us for a lot of adversity that may come along during the season and a lot of talented players we have in the ovc
7728626 we know weve got to take one game at a time and we know the conference games are the most important to get that ovc championship
7728627 were he said the department is working with the university to prevent any accidental fire alarms
7728628 its their home opener so i know theyll be focused
7728629 theyre a big ten team which means theyre probably going to have a lot of strength and speed theyll probably try to draw on the success they had last season
7728630 we just need to defend as a team and it will create opportunities
7728631 a good defense creates a good offense and we just need to do that and stick together as a team
7728632 it gave me a better understanding of what i read and see peoples point of view in the book
7728633 the program was started a few years ago to give freshmen a communal experience that would bring together a variety of topics to help set an academic tone
7728634 i honesty think its a waste of time because in my group nobody read the book
7728635 we wanted something for students to do during the summer and come back to be involved with
7728636 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team
7728637 and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7728638 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7728639 yes that monster seems to be behaving a little oddly
7728640 you better take care of me lord if you dont youre gonna have me on your hands
7728641 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
7728642 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
7728643 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia

7728716 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7728717 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7728718 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7728719 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7728720 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7728721 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7728722 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can

7728759 the litter report line is an important way for the community to get involved and help tackle the problem of littering

7728797 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7728798 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7728799 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7728800 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7728801 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7728802 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7728803 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7728804 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7728805 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7728806 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
7728807 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7728808 sudanese forces faced huge resistance with a large number of citizens blocking the entry of the forces with barricades civilians were brought into the streets as human shields
7728809 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate
7728810 the government sent a strong military force and attacked the camp with the intention of killing civilians

7728816 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection
7728817 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7728818 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7728819 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7728820 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7728821 we lost a lot of kids at the high school level
7728822 a shift in population to the southern portion of the county resulted in severe overcrowding in some schools
7728823 je moet het goed uitkiezen want dat ene weekje kan zomaar je leven veranderen
7728824 omdat we zoveel jaar bestaan mogen we 1 maand gratis weg geven aan 1 student en we hebben voor jou gekozen
7728825 i remembered hearing about when the guys went last year and thought it would be a neat experience
7728826 both jon and tyler told me it was a once in a lifetime type of experience to visit the exchange and to meet so many people im really glad that we had the chance to do it
7728827 chris and i were joking because in the last article all of jon and tylers quotes were like working on wall street is just like basketball so we were joking how we didnt want to have quotes like that
7728828 i found myself putting my foot in my mouth afterwards because i cant deny there were a lot of connections like all of the real time decisions where they know they are going to have mistakes and be able to deal with those mistakes and still keep going with all the energy they have
7728829 one of the most eye opening aspects was getting out on the floor
7728830 its a lot different from what you think and being down there you realize how hectic it is it was amazing to see how things fast move for them i just tried to absorb as much as i could
7728831 for me its always been a text book knowledge of what goes on and what ive read in magazines
7728832 i read the economist all the time and so i see some of the impact of how things are affected but ive never seen the hands on people behind the numbers the people behind the companies and the banks
7728833 we would walk into a room with a hundred people that i didnt know or didnt recognize and then after being there for a half an hour i realized that a good portion of them were georgetown alumni so it made bryon and i feel very welcome and we felt like we fit in very well
7728834 it was interesting to meet with him because he talked to us much less about his job and the financial world and more about life in general
7728835 being able to come through georgetown and the basketball program and to see what hes doing now it showed what we can accomplish too
7728836 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7728837 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell without
7728838 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7728839 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7728840 its a very active period of that balance because commonly you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7728841 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7728842 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7728843 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7728844 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7728845 offers the potential for stroke patients to recover return to nearly normal functional status and stay out of nursing homes
7728846 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7728847 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7728848 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization treatment that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7728849 theres no compelling need for a circus like 10 foot high billboard on stilts at this site
7728850 a lot of times people come to campus and theyre not sure where theyre going especially visitors
7728851 were seeing a much higher volume of people who are lost
7728852 the people of gettysburg want what is right in terms of character and common sense
7728853 but when he told me his choice i said thats the right choice
7728854 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path
7728855 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7728856 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar

7728861 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7728862 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7728863 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7728864 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7728865 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7728873 so go ahead and have a taste of your own medicine
7728874 and you were no picnic and you were no prize but you had just enough pathos to keep me hypnotized
7728875 reality is subjective and theres an unenlightened tendency in this culture to regard something as important only if its sober and severe
7728876 i know we have enough to fill out a jv and sophomore team but still need more players for both teams because we barely have enough to field a team on each one
7728877 if anything we are hurting for varsity players because we only have five right now
7728878 we are looking for kids from freeport surfside quintana oyster creek and jones creek
7728879 ive been driving around handing out fliers so that if they want to join they can come to our practices monday through friday 5 45 to 7 30 p m here at freeport intermediate
7728880 what happened was that it took awhile for our league to be approved by the gulf coast chapter
7728881 we finally got approved at the end of july but i tell you what lake jackson has helped us a lot to get this thing going by helping us out with equipment and doing whatever they could
7728882 theyve been out here for three weeks practicing and id hate to let these kids down
7728883 we just want these kids to get a chance to play
7728884 some couldnt join the hurricanes because their teams were full already so we are just trying to take care of these kids so they wont be left out
7728885 sizemore s unbelieveable you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th home run
7728886 in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7728887 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7728888 the indians have been on a roll but i thought that we did a good job of shutting them down tonight
7728889 what hurt us was not enough offense we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs i saw this in kansas city and it carried over again tonight
7728890 it was a decent pitch i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7728891 at first i thought it was going foul but to my surprise it didnt
7728892 lauren is a very special runner the best female runner ive ever coached
7728893 she has some special ability shes going to be favored to do it all again this year and theres no reason why she cant
7728894 lauren can do it all and now she really has become somebody to follow for the girls and the boys teams
7728895 the girls finished fourth in district last season and we were a few finishes from third place and a trip to regional
7728896 the girls havent reached region since 1992 but i have a strong feeling were going to make it this year we have a strong hard working group
7728897 we finished fifth in district last season but again i think this group can run to a top three finish
7728898 we have the numbers and the talent to do it its going to take hard work but the potential is there
7728899 we have some real good experience with the girls and the talent and ability is there
7728900 were hoping for a first place finish at district and then to do well at regionals a top 15 finish
7728901 the boys are shooting for a top three finish in district so they can get to regionals
7728902 they say the girls had all the fun last year advancing and thats what their goal is this season
7728903 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7728904 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7728905 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7728906 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7728907 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7728908 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7728909 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7728910 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7728911 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7728912 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7728913 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7728914 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7728915 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7728916 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7728917 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7728918 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7728919 no one works for someone we all just work together
7728920 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7728921 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7728922 these ac 130 gunships are pretty awesome weapons of war
7728923 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7728924 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7728925 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7728926 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7728927 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7728928 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7728929 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7728930 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7728931 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7728932 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7728933 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7728934 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7728935 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7728936 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7728937 with the success theyve had theres no selfish guys on this team
7728938 its different than toronto everyone talks to everyone and when you come into a situation like that you have to feel good about it from the first time i walked into the locker room i was greeted its a different team and a different atmosphere
7728939 i had the opportunity to work with the first group on offence completed some throws and threw three touchdown passes its a good situation to be in but i know i have to go out and not press too much but getting this opportunity says a lot about the coaching staff and my new teammates
7728940 because of the injury situation we had to alter our offence
7728941 when we traded kerry joseph to toronto in march we felt wed have a good offensive line and a receiving corps equal to the better groups in the league but who couldve predicted losing half our offence to injury
7728942 so weve had to change our strategy and need an athletic quarterback to give us pass rush options and open things up for running back wes cates
7728943 any time you make a change of this magnitude with a person as highly respected as marcus theres going to be emotion
7728944 in the big picture you understand that players are people who wear jerseys for a living they have strong relationships and theres going to be a reaction
7728945 but we have a strong group and theyll bounce back and you could see that yesterday
7728946 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7728947 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7728948 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7728949 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7728950 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7728951 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7728952 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7728953 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7728954 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7728955 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7728956 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7728957 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7728958 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7728959 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7728960 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7728961 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7728962 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7728963 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7728964 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7728965 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7728966 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7728967 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7728968 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7728969 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7728970 wed follow you to hell sir but you damned sure didnt go that direction
7728971 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7728972 this is a planning took where all things are going
7728973 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7728974 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7728975 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7728976 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7728977 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7728978 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7728979 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7728980 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7728981 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7728982 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7728983 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7728984 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7728985 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7728986 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7728987 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7728988 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7728989 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7728990 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7728991 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7728992 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7728993 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7728994 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7728995 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7728996 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7728997 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7728998 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7728999 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7729000 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7729001 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7729002 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7729003 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7729004 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7729005 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7729006 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7729007 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7729008 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7729009 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7729010 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7729011 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7729012 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7729013 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7729014 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7729015 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7729016 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7729017 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7729018 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7729019 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7729020 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7729021 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7729022 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7729023 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7729024 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7729025 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7729026 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7729027 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7729028 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7729029 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7729030 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7729031 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7729032 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7729033 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7729034 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7729035 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7729036 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7729037 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7729038 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7729039 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7729040 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7729041 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7729042 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7729043 the events were aimed at those girls who use any excuse to get out of school pe we wanted to remind the girls how important physical activity is to live a healthy lifestyle and we want to help them find an activity that they enjoy the days have allowed the girls to try new activities and find one that suits them
7729044 as a result of last years events girls from archbishop blanch attended sessions at awesome walls some even going back to climb in their free time this was something that had never been contemplated before and so was a great outcome
7729045 i believe we are drawn to david because we are looking to fill something that is missing in our lives and it may be different for every one of us
7729046 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7729047 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7729048 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7729049 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7729050 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7729051 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7729052 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7729053 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7729054 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7729055 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7729056 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7729057 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7729058 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7729059 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7729060 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7729061 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7729062 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7729063 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7729064 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7729065 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7729066 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7729067 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7729068 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7729069 market shoppers in garston being encouraged to use herbs such as parsley rather than adding salt
7729070 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7729071 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7729072 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7729073 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7729075 all delegates to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them
7729076 please watch this video mitch mallett is the delegate who is speaking to the hillary supporter please email mitch itsyourgavel com a quick note to say hillary did not release her delegates to vote for obama they have a duty to vote for her on the first ballot and this guy is from florda how anyone from florida or michigan would back obama at this point is beyond me
7729077 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7729078 both durham and bakalian said obama has not yet won their support they are waiting to see how clinton is treated at the convention and to make sure the nominating process is run fairly
7729079 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7729080 im still pledged to hillary because i was elected by my district to be her pledged delegate and im honoring the voters who voted for her
7729081 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7729082 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7729083 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7729084 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7729089 waitrose is continually looking at ways of reducing its impact on the environment anaerobic digestion has been operating in other european countries such as germany for decades so we thought it was well worth trying out on a commercial scale for our supermarkets
7729090 so far the signs are really positive and this looks to be a sustainable way of eliminating the need to send waste food to landfill
7729091 consumers will be delighted that waitrose is pioneering the use of anaerobic digestion in the retail market it shows that retailers can make positive environmental changes at all stages in the food chain treating food waste management as seriously as food sourcing and creating a positive circle whereby food waste can be recycled back to fertiliser for the land in a process which produces renewable energy and avoids sending waste to landfill where it can produce greenhouse gases
7729092 its not meant to be here everybodys had their heart in it do something good but nature is a lot stronger than good intentions
7729093 there was no major damage water washed over and itll dry up
7729094 oooooh girl its a good thing i like my women pretty instead of domesticated
7729095 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7729096 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7729097 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7729098 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7729099 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7729100 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7729101 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7729102 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7729103 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7729104 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party
7729105 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7729117 i dont think they will be able to get along over the next several years without going toe to toe with us in the summer
7729118 keeping an air con at 25 degrees celsius and 80 percent of humidity is best but not many people know about this
7729119 while fewer than half the respondents do not follow the energy saving tips the government should further promote the green hong kong concept such as the mandatory energy efficiency labeling scheme
7729120 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7729121 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7729122 no thats not a canal its a channelized stream and an old bridge abutment the canal is that grassy soggy ditch on the other end of town
7729123 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity

7729125 i come here as a wife who loves my husband

7729127 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7729128 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7729129 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7729130 and you see that is why i love this country
7729131 now you know why i asked her out so many times you want a persistent president
7729132 oh no i cant use optimum any more i only use nexxus shampoo now
7729133 i think that i may rather have someone else do my hair
7729134 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7729151 eu praticamente fiquei est vel em empate t cnico em primeiro lugar

7729157 o ibope deu 2 esses 2 d 28 mil votos come ou o programa eleitoral e essas pessoas disseram que n o v o votar mais nele de se estranhar
7729158 prefere acreditar no sentimento das ruas e nas avalia es que faz
7729159 s o mais de 800 pesquisados desses quantos votos eu tive eu posso ter tido sete oito votos e esse n mero eu n o tenho
7729160 n o me deixam fazer campanha durante a campanha para senador em 2006 que eu pude fazer campanha eu fui a 3 dos votos sem fazer praticamente nada sem sair de casa esse ano n o tenho programa eleitoral at agora

7729162 o que poder amos fazer mandar as crian as de volta para o abrigo ou decretar que as duas se separassem
7729163 mas houve rea o quando foi para a c mara dos deputados deram pra tr s um grande desservi o do legislador
7729164 o legislador muito preconceituoso parece que tenta frear a lei tem que olhar pra frente falta coragem o ideal que o legislador tivesse um pouco mais de responsabilidade sem ficar com medo de ser rotulado
7729165 vivemos num pa s laico n o se pode julgar e decidir sobre cren as religiosas
7729166 alguns pastores n o poderiam falar mal dos homossexuais durante os cultos olha que linha de argumenta o horr vel

7729174 o desafio da justi a brasileira enxergar a realidade da vida aquela imagem da justi a cega com a venda nos olhos um horror preciso ter coragem e sinceridade sem formalismo exacerbado s vezes a gente tem que se colocar no lugar da outra pessoa
7729175 o legislador n o pode ficar esperando que se consolide uma mudan a por parte da sociedade para criar novas leis familiares e nem preocupa o dessa ordem muito mais covardia medo eles est o preocupados com a reelei o apoiar minorias pode desagradar o eleitorado majoritariamente preconceituoso as casas legislativas est o dominadas por religiosos que se juntam com os conservadores de plant o maioria t o mais ampla que n o se tem a m nima chance de aprovar nada
7729176 n o reconhecer os v nculos das rela es homoafetivas gera injusti as enormes

7729258 i dunno my hearing aid is working i can hear i just cant understand what they are saying
7729259 the best times have to be when we get such fantastic feedback going 10 issues a year was a very scary concept but all our readers and advertisers are 100 behind us the worst times have to be the deadline when im up late designing pages and trying to do the 101 other things that come with running a business too well have an art editor soon so at least that pressure is reduced
7729260 we dont feel its right to make our readers pay for 20 pages of adverts
7729261 well have no book extracts or designs from yarn companies because were independent we dont feel pressurized into reproducing designs for the sake of advertising
7729262 we can be gluttonous with our space and have lots of large charts on the patterns
7729263 there is so much out there in the knitting world that 2 pages just isnt enough room to really do something justice
7729264 we had one of those old fashioned shops where customers could lay away yarn and would buy a ball a week it was my job to sort all the lay away yarn mum used to design and sell knitwear for the shop one day a jumper that shed marked up for 20 was snapped up by two ladies who after paying informed mum that they were going to sell it in their london boutique for 200 that was back in the eighties
7729265 mum still wasnt convinced that id finish it so chose some awful shades of yarn battleship grey acrylic chunky with the half stripes alternating in white or cerise chunky mohair i finished it in a week though i hardly wore it as the colours were so bad
7729266 it wasnt very trendy to knit and i got into other hobbies like painting drawing cardmaking and crossstitch and boys
7729267 id pick up my needles to make the occasional garment but study and partying took up much of my time
7729268 nothing was going to stop me working on it i got the job as operations editor in 2003 and really embraced the craft again i couldnt stop knitting and designing and my husband was in shock at how much stash i managed to acquire we became the odd couple he would sit there reviewing the latest playstation games while i sat and knitted all night the perfect jobs for both of us
7729269 sometimes i can pick up a ball and picture exactly how i feel it should be knitted up sometimes im given yarn and told to make something which is harder to do theres no set way that i go about my designing i have been known to follow a person wearing knitwear to work out how its constructed then stop and write notes in my pad that i take everywhere with me i currently have an idea for a cabled sweater thats inspired by fence that i pass on my way into town among many others i like to make practical things that people will wear or use
7729270 i can never follow a pattern to the word i may start off with all good intentions but then ill ad lib and put my own little touches to it like leaving out a line of pattern for a few rows or putting a cable in the rib or even adding something completely new
7729271 a st st jumper would bore me rigid i like to work with 4 ply though saying that i do like to knit with chunky and super chunky i also like knitting socks especially in variegated yarns i like to see the colours pass through the needles watching them is quite addictive accessories are a good quick knit and great for presents
7729272 at some point soon id like to get back into it i like the way that crochet grows really quickly
7729273 i hate frogging as does everyone i just cant contemplate knitting something to rip it all out again time is precious so before i embark on a project i make sure its exactly right on paper and in my head so far ive only had problems with one garment on the fifth attempt i really felt like burning the yarn it just wouldnt do what i wanted
7729274 swatching is also that necessary evil i just want to get straight on and knit its so important though when i was designing the fulled slippers for knitted sock sensations i did a swatch and fulled it at 40 degrees to work out the shrinkage for some inexplicable reason when id finished the knitting of the socks i decided to put the machine dial to 50 when i took out the miniscule slippers i could have cried
7729275 my biggest knitting nightmare was when a certain delivery service delivered my parcel of 8 new designs to the wrong address i was so upset that my wonderful husband drove all the way from wiltshire to london at 10pm at night to get it back hed never driven in a city before and the route wed planned was blocked off when he reached london somehow he found the scary block of flats after midnight and woke up the poor bemused chap to retrieve the parcel you cant imagine how elated i was when he called me to say he had it in hands
7729276 i love the wedding socks that i made for my best friend that are featured in the current issue it was such a special day and that design holds so many memories i was knitting them in the limo on the hen night though had to give up when i dropped stitches after the third glass of bubbly
7729277 i designed it and my mum knitted all 81 squares in record time then we spent 8 hours sewing them all together it was a real labour of love i lost my mum last year and every time i look at that blanket it reminds me of her and the work we did together on it
7729278 but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you or by any human court in fact i do not even judge myself it is the lord who judges me therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time before the lord comes who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart then each one will receive his commendation from god

7729305 from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7729306 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot on at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7729307 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7729308 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7729309 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7729310 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7729311 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7729312 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7729313 you normally have some weeks off to prepare for the last part of the season
7729314 this year i didnt have a lot of time to prepare after wimbledon for the hardcourt season
7729315 in two weeks two times 12 hours of jet lag after wimbledon i only had six or seven days to recover and before that i played queens monte carlo barcelona hamburg roland garros plus wimbledon also
7729316 i have to be very happy i must be very happy for how i did this year
7729317 if i lose in the next round hopefully not im happy about how i played this year
7729318 i just want to try to continue playing like this in this tournament
7729319 it was very exciting one week ago to win the gold medal but at the same time i knew i had to play here in one week
7729320 thats not a problem i won roland garros and in one week i have to be 100 per cent ready for wimbledon im ready for these things
7729321 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7729322 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7729323 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas

7729331 as a result of numerous consumer complaints of dizziness and nausea promofoods requested that eight million cans of tuna be returned for testing last year promofoods concluded that the cans did not after all contain chemicals that posed a health risk this conclusion is based on the fact that the chemists from promofoods tested samples of the recalled cans and found that of the eight chemicals most commonly blamed for causing symptoms of dizziness and nausea five were not found in any of the tested cans the chemists did find that the three remaining suspected chemicals are naturally found in all other kinds of canned foods

7729350 last night at 11 09 i got a call from a company pushing a 6 day class in microsoft crm they are the experts etc i called them back today the reason for the late night call was that they hadnt broken out the list by geography i told him that this didnt leave me with much faith in his companys ability to provide quality crm training
7729351 we believe that this transaction is the right decision for onyx shareholders customers partners and employees
7729352 we see an outstanding opportunity in the relationship between onyx and made2manage systems as consolidators of the crm and erp software markets

7729359 hes not way out of shape but hes not in his best shape
7729360 they both have worked really hard they both have to get ready to play this week
7729361 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people

7729365 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7729366 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7729367 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
7729368 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
7729369 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
7729370 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7729371 sometime over the next 40 years this will become everyday technology
7729372 if we could really cut the cord and not be burdened with all these heavy batteries and not worry if you have the charger if we could transmit power wirelessly think of all the machines that would become much more efficient

7729380 weve announced we are going to bring a new focus into production here into australia and it will also be a focus that we can export into the asia pacific region

7729382 the real thing here is the ford transformation of bringing all these resources together in every market around the world and australia is a tremendous opportunity for us
7729383 i think as far as i can see that the expertise we have in large vehicles in australia we will utilise for as far as i can see in the future

7729400 we consider whether comcast a provider of broadband internet access over cable lines may selectively target and interfere with connections of peer to peer p2p applications under the facts of this case
7729401 although comcast asserts that its conduct is necessary to ease network congestion we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet and does not constitute reasonable network management
7729402 accordingly we institute a plan that will bring comcasts unreasonable conduct to an end
7729403 in particular we require comcast within 30 days to disclose the details of their unreasonable network management practices submit a compliance plan describing how it intends to stop these unreasonable management practices by the end of the year and disclose to both the commission and the public the details of the network management practices that it intends to deploy following termination of its current practices

7729408 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7729409 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7729412 require that gas stations owned by the major oil companies install at least one natural gas fueling pump in each station by 2018 offer a 90 000 tax credit to encourage gas station owners to install natural gas fuel pumps provide 2 6 billion in bonding authority to states to provide no or low interest loans to service stations to install natural gas pumps and include tax credits for buyers of home refueling systems it is expected that the legislation will be formally introduced shortly
7729413 this proposal is a hat trick for america its good for our environment good for our national security and good for families
7729414 our addiction to oil has only gotten worse and drivers are suffering each time they fill up their tank encouraging the use of natural gas will help end our dependence on foreign oil and save money for families across the country
7729415 coming from a producing state i believe this legislation will spur economic growth and job creation
7729416 most importantly it will increase the nations energy independence while providing hard working americans with a cheaper cleaner alternative to the rising cost of gasoline there are also provisions that greatly encourage market development so that current and future ngv owners have more locations that serve their vehicles
7729417 this is an emergency we cant drill our way out of
7729418 we are of course extremely proud of him proud of his achievements but more proud of him as a person for the way he coped with those achievements
7729419 were very touched that people continue to remember him as they do so long after he retired from playing cricket
7729420 i suppose it the level of interest does astound us it always astounded him
7729421 he couldnt understand why people still remembered him so long after hed finished playing
7729422 i think we share that same outlook but its clear that people do and that clearly relates partly to his achievements but i think it also relates to something that is deeper and more significant than that
7729423 the fact we have this collection is in no small measure due to my mother
7729424 my father was a chucker outer and my mother in good measure nurtured this collection she was very keen on keeping family things together
7729425 the most distinctive thing about the collection is that the entire collection comes from the bradman family home and that is how my father wanted it to remain
7729426 i played with this stuff in the backyard which people now handle with white gloves so it is very precious to our family and im delighted we can continue to be associated with it
7729427 tim nielsen invited shaun to get some training practice with the australian team and australia a team who have both been training at allan border field
7729428 he bowled a long spell on the centre wicket today against some of the australian batsmen including mike hussey
7729429 but i think our system with one striker and one behind me and with two midfielders it was very difficult to get support when we got the ball up front
7729430 theyve got good midfield players and they had a lot of movement
7729431 they made it very difficult for us to win the midfield
7729432 we needed more balls up front because they werent very quick in defence
7729433 when the other clubs see that one player can make the difference they kick you and make it physical
7729434 i miss diego in midfield to give the passes and we miss cassio to come forward to give the crosses

7729443 i was pretty lucky because if it had broken at speed we could have had an even worse outcome or even an accident

7729445 there is no doubt he can start a test he is perfectly capable of that as are all of them
7729446 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldnt recommend anything like that
7729447 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game
7729448 bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7729449 its a matter of history that we lost that series
7729450 there was a lot of analysis and introspection afterwards and we took a number of steps to address the situation
7729451 we set the record straight when we met on our soil two summers ago
7729452 it trescothicks claim is ancient history and we are not going to breathe life into ancient history

7729512 i lament that we waste so much time and money in punishing crimes and take so little pains to prevent them we neglect the only means of establishing and perpetuating our republican forms of government that is the universal education of our youth in the principles of christianity by means of the bible for this divine book above all others constitutes the soul of republicanism

7729547 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7729548 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7729549 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys

7729600 i was very very happy to hear they were keeping some of the routes for a while there it sounded like there was going to be nothing for manchester
7729601 it would be nice if something was coming to manchester later
7729602 i just think we really really dropped the ball on this
7729603 the notion that somehow from washington you get this vast foreign policy experience is illusory
7729604 those were two moments that really stand out in my mind

7729607 when i heard the forecast was rain i said thats all right with me
7729608 she wasnt nervous at all before the race and she was very comfortable and confident
7729609 we all had a really positive feeling that it was going to be a great effort on her part
7729610 i was doing the math when i hit 10k and then i was doing the math when i hit 18k even though i was racing myself i was still racing that certainly makes it more fun and gave me a reason to get out of a comfort zone
7729611 i didnt know about the lip synching at the opening ceremonies until my family got here
7729612 it was a two and a half hour travel time to connect with them
7729613 the day before the race i was really tempted i really wanted to see them but i needed to be smart
7729614 i was a little bit disappointed that i wasnt going to be able to see them before i raced two days not seeing them and then racing without even being able to give them a hug thats hard for me
7729615 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7729616 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7729617 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7729618 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7729619 i was at the point where i was looking for a while and i decided if i get a job its going to be somebody who already knows me

7729624 when coach currier left i wanted to talk to coach faucher and see if this is really something he wanted to do
7729625 from the get go we knew what we wanted at daniel webster and we absolutely got the right person for us
7729626 you see his energy weve had some real good young coaches here who have gotten outstanding opportunities to move on we wanted to bring in someone with the same type of enthusiasm youthful enthusiasm but with an idea of staying a little longer and giving the institution a better grasp of the total commitment it takes over the long haul i think thats what weve accomplished with this hire

7729628 intended to frighten three separate locations with his false report and the crimes should be treated separately
7729629 i am willing to believe mr palermos plea for drug counseling was legitimate and i hope he receives some
7729630 however the chaos and sheer waste of manpower that he caused clearly calls for a prison sentence
7729631 we talked about it and decided it just wasnt right for her not to have one
7729632 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
7729633 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
7729634 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
7729635 it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
7729636 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
7729637 the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution
7729638 this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything
7729639 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
7729640 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children that was unthinkable only a year ago
7729641 and we have to have a big enough surge that we can get baghdad under control and then anbar province under control
7729642 i wanted to stand with my partys nominee and be here
7729643 ultimately no one can accomplish anything alone we need to be part of a team
7729644 this convention is about building a team for change thats strong enough to get a working majority in the house and senate and elect barack obama
7729645 our daily lives are so chaotic and so confusing and so pressure filled
7729646 i want the country and the congress to get it right i believe that is possible again
7729647 the chance for that progressive moment is what led me into this senate race
7729648 elections are about the future and im going to talk about the future my candidacy is about changing the direction of the country
7729649 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7729650 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7729651 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7729652 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about before i go to bed at night
7729653 now you know why i asked her out so many times even after she said no obama said
7729654 i have not paid much attention about what people say about me who dont know me
7729655 it would be very hard for me to function in this world and to go through princeton and harvard and to work in all the careers that ive worked if i worried about labels
7729656 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another

7729658 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
7729659 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure

7729683 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7729684 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7729685 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world

7729740 moderate muslim scholars said there were no reasons to reject homosexuals under islam and that the condemnation of homosexuals and homosexuality by mainstream ulema and many other muslims was based on narrow minded interpretations of islamic teachings
7729741 tidak ada perbedaan antara lesbian dengan non lesbian dalam pandangan tuhan manusia dihargai hanya berdasarkan ketaatannya there is no difference between lesbians and nonlesbians in the eyes of god people are valued based on their piety
7729742 condemnation of homosexuality was voiced by two conservative muslim groups the indonesian ulema council mui and hizbut thahir indonesia hti
7729743 kami tidak akan menganggap homoseksualitas sebagai musuh tetapi kami akan membuat mereka sadar bahwa apa yang mereka lakukan adalah salah
7729744 it scripture does attest to the fact that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered and can in no case be approved of
7729745 siapa saja yang menemukan pria pelaku homoseks maka bunuhlah pelakunya tersebut
7729746 karena keinginan untuk menikahkan putrinya tidak kesampaian tentu luth amat kecewa luth kemudian menganggap kedua laki laki tadi tidak normal istri luth bisa memahami keadaan laki laki tersebut dan berusaha menyadarkan luth tapi oleh luth malah dianggap istri yang melawan suami dan dianggap mendukung kedua laki laki yang dinilai luth tidak normal kenapa luth menilai buruk terhadap kedua laki laki yang kebetulan homo tersebut sejauh yang saya tahu al quran tidak memberi jawaban yang jelas tetapi kebencian luth terhadap kaum homo di samping karena faktor kecewa karena tidak berhasil menikahkan kedua putrinya juga karena anggapan luth yang salah terhadap kaum homo
7729747 mengapa kalian mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorang pun sebelum kalian sesungguhnya kalian mendatangi laki laki untuk melepaskan syahwat bukan kepada wanita malah kalian ini kaum yang melampaui batas
7729748 usirlah mereka dari kotamu ini sesungguhnya mereka adalah orang orang yang berpura pura menyucikan diri
7729749 ya kita tentu menyambut gembira upaya yang dilakukan oleh fakultas syariah iain walisongo tersebut
7729750 hanya orang primitif saja yang melihat perkawinan sejenis sebagai sesuatu yang abnormal dan berbahaya bagi kami tiada alasan kuat bagi siapa pun dengan dalih apa pun untuk melarang perkawinan sejenis sebab tuhan pun sudah maklum bahwa proyek nya menciptakan manusia sudah berhasil bahkan kebablasan
7729751 i wouldve thought it was a state government driven thing and its important for the fish industry to have a market
7729752 we wanted to make it more discoverable to bubble up the features that people didnt always find
7729753 the votes not until the end of november so there is room to do significant planning
7729754 the contract is open in this sense that weve put to awb that well operate four trains for them wherever they require depending on the grain conditions
7729755 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market mr heffernan said
7729756 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over 1 to 1 5 per cent
7729757 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year mr heffernan said
7729758 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so
7729759 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7729760 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7729761 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7729762 this country does not care about liberty when there are immigration raids taking place
7729763 proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof
7729764 the kiwi has been hit very hard and the aussie has gone along for the ride mr milton said
7729765 i cant see any blue sky at the moment i cant see any valid reason why youd really want to be buying the aussie at the moment mr milton said
7729766 the aussie has a good reason to be down here mr milton said
7729767 theres not a lot of positive news out there for the aussie at the moment not enough to counter this down move
7729768 the kiwi has been hit very hard and the aussie has gone along for the ride mr milton said
7729769 i cant see any blue sky at the moment i cant see any valid reason why youd really want to be buying the aussie at the moment mr milton said
7729770 the aussie has a good reason to be down here mr milton said
7729771 theres not a lot of positive news out there for the aussie at the moment not enough to counter this down move
7729772 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account
7729773 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7729774 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7729775 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified

7729777 they actually believe that drilling off shore will lower the price of oil
7729778 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know that me personally im choosing the best candidate because hes been a fighter for the immigration issues
7729779 so for me hes the best guy to lead this nation
7729780 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7729781 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7729782 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7729783 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7729784 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7729785 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7729786 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7729787 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7729788 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7729789 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7729790 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7729791 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7729792 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7729793 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7729794 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7729795 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7729796 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7729797 none of us had been making any money wed play for seven months a year and make 5 000 i had given up on open tennis the sports leaders finally saw the light we all knew open tennis would be successful
7729798 for me to be able to get back to playing wimbledon and all the great tournaments was great
7729799 at the time the final decision was made on the freeway route i said we now need to ensure that we get the best possible outcomes from the project i dont think we are there yet and i believe more needs to be done
7729800 i dont believe the landscaping has met expectations in areas along the route
7729801 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose
7729802 you are entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts
7729803 apostolic times christian tradition held that abortion was grievously evil
7729804 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether they are famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
7729805 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
7729806 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
7729807 if you have forsaken the principles of your faith for political power what principles guide you now
7729808 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market mr heffernan said
7729809 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over 1 to 1 5 per cent
7729810 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year mr heffernan said
7729811 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so

7729816 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7729817 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7729818 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7729819 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys

7729824 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit

7729834 a lot of the investment in online advertising has been from technology focused folks trying to solve problems and impose solutions on a market
7729835 well do you see how the small hand is between 12 and 1
7729836 well if the small hand is in between two numbers you pick the smaller number except in this case its between 12 and 1 so you go backwards to 12
7729837 okay now see how the big hand is pointing to the seven
7729838 well you take seven and you multiply it by five and you get thirty five so the time is twelve thirty five
7729839 well i guess ill ask mom when i go back there
7729840 ill just give this to the guys in the web design thingy theres like 3 of them
7729841 we know that a lot of agencies in the community are doing things to help with reducing violence
7729842 the problems we see with youth violence are not going to be solved just at the courthouse or the schoolhouse but at the childs house
7729843 dramatically higher than the statewide average of 36 21 per 1 000
7729844 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
7729845 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
7729846 the seriousness of such failures could be beyond the stretch of peoples imagination
7729847 if any one of you is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone
7729848 then neither do i condemn you come now and leave your life of sin
7729849 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

7729853 chinese refiners are unable to match gains from the high price of crude oil in international markets due to controls on retail prices
7729854 they should take advantage of this opportunity to adjust retail prices
7729855 the only question is how long will it take to get there
7729856 just a few filthy rich corporatists who are making vulgar profits
7729857 it is going to happen where is the dam going to crack first
7729858 i dont see it as obama doing this i see this as the country doing this
7729859 all of us cant continue on a path that we are on
7729860 organized for the benefit of the community or the social welfare of the community
7729861 cindy mccain is on her way to the country of georgia to assess the civilian casualties
7729862 what was important was in conveying what kind of a human being barack obama is this is a real family she loves her husband he loves her these daughters are these elegant delightful loving kids you cant fake that kind of stuff
7729863 the promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office
7729864 if you cant stop it you shouldnt be pulling it
7729865 re evaluates the necessity for allowing high speed tug towing of aircraft across runways
7729866 at night it needs to be lit so that so we can see it and so other aircraft can see it as well
7729867 i think if they cant stop in the same distance that an empty aircraft can stop itself then i dont think they should be out there
7729868 discontent over the failure of our political system is rampant throughout our citizenry
7729869 it is in this gathering of discontent that my candidacy intends to find its voice
7729870 we wonder why it is that blue collar workers who come from a heritage that is the democratic party began to leave it its because we really dont respect them
7729871 hes a happy warrior he loves the whole thing but hell punch you out
7729872 nobody has as many ties in the foreign policy establishment as joe does
7729873 become a great pantomime where the standard of judgment is no longer real results but the flickering image of seriousness skillfully crafted to squeeze into a 30 second spot have a problem we have an answer but rarely a solution
7729874 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7729875 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7729876 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7729877 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also afghanistan
7729878 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7729879 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7729880 struggle for restoration of the judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7729881 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate
7729882 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7729883 despite the break up of the coalition both parties should continue to work for the stability of the country
7729884 we will play the role of constructive opposition and will not create hurdles for the ppp government
7729885 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7729886 i would say if he doesnt practice by tuesday theres a very slim chance hell play in the opener

7729890 every time he hits a home run he helps us out there
7729891 isnt getting dirty and fucking a mechanic right there in the garage every womans secret fantasy
7729892 what was i thinking about while i was taking these pictures
7729893 none of the guys ive dated and had sex with ever said anything to me about shaving off my pubes
7729894 you can probably tell that im not the shy type i like the way i look and i like being looked at
7729895 i decided that i wanted to be in a magazine and i went into the sex shop and bought some mags to see which would be a best for me to send my pictures to it wasnt till i had decided on newcummers that i even told my guy what i wanted to do he got all possessive about his woman being on display for strangers to see and jack over but he changed his mind when i said hed get to take the photos i think he did a pretty good job of it ive laid around naked in the sun a few times but ive never gotten sexed up outdoors before
7729896 who or what really determines fashion the fashion to which man thinks he must subject clothes headgear and hairstyle the alternation of assurance and then of exposure first to the rather sympathetic astonishment and then to the horror and amusement of those who think they must follow the new fashion how is it that womens fashions change so much more quickly and solemnly and intensively than mens who wants it this way the particular industry that tirelessly makes money out of it and whose kings we are told reside especially in paris but who has made these people the kings what is it that has always made this industry so lucrative how has it come about that since the end of the eighteenth century mens clothing has become so monotonous and uninteresting conversely how has it come about that world history might be presented from the standpoint of the sequence in which men have thought that they should shave or not shave their faces or adorn them with the boldest or most hideous arrangements of hair who inspires and directs these processes which are not a matter of indifference to the feeling for life and all that it implies if it is a matter of rapidly changing taste what released spirit of the earth pulls the strings so that this fancy passes another which is anxiously watched by millions comes and prevails and then after a while it too departs
7729897 never has there been a more devastating combination of beauty and big tits in score than bea
7729898 shes so gorgeous its almost painful to look at her why she isnt gracing the silver screen is beyond me id love to see her strut her stuff in a bond movie as would daniel craig i imagine
7729899 he needs to talk about it now he needs to talk about it very specifically i think he will not only during the convention but in the campaign that follows
7729900 i will certainly be talking about the economy and some of the problems that exist and i will be comparing in a brief way what i perceive to be the mccain approach versus the obama approach
7729901 obama has never enjoyed the kind of privilege that sen mccain has enjoyed
7729902 sen mccain was the son of an admiral and has lived an affluent privileged life and continues to do so
7729903 i think men are really scared when they dont know me
7729904 im hillary clinton and i do not approve this message
7729905 let there be no mistake about it we are united we are united for change we are after all democrats so it may take awhile were not the fall in line party were diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united
7729906 i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack and joe biden as you worked for me
7729907 to establish if customers partner is living at the property
7729908 by this evening he will be transferred to the isola dell amore fraterno in romes via ardeatina
7729909 most likely the senator will want to find a more appropriate arrangement shortly
7729910 in about a month we will ask for him to be set freed while waiting for the appeal
7729911 lo believes that a wide and active artistic and cultural life contributes to increased quality of life
7729912 whats so good about the mela festifal is that its a family festival with lots of activities for big and small
7729913 i will not respond to a gang of terrorists they are not combatants but vulgar killers and assassins of children old people women and the disabled
7729914 they have tainted the palestinian cause for freedom also killing its own people inside and outside the gaza strip in league with hamas and hezbollah
7729915 the popular front for the liberation of palestine totally rejects the statements of former italian prime minister and senator for life francesco cossiga that were published in the lebanese newspaper al safir on july 9 2008
7729916 falsely accused the pflp of masterminding an attack on the bologna train station in northeastern italy 28 years ago
7729917 the front furthermore in denying these false allegations expressed its strong condemnation of the actions of some italian politicians in fabricating lies to serve hostile policies against our people
7729918 the pflp noted that this accusation comes at a time when european solidarity with palestine and the palestinian cause is increasing among the peoples of europe
7729919 this is most likely linked to the fact that last year a lot of iraqis were permitted to stay while this year many have had their asylum applications rejected
7729920 monotheistic religions were sent by god in chronological order as a result it is unusual to go from the latest religion to the one that preceded it

7729922 father thomas director of our pastoral centre is hiding in the forest
7729923 from there tears in his eyes and sorrow in his heart he saw it go up in smoke just before the attack he phoned me and i told him pray and be vigilant but when he saw mobs of people coming towards the centre he had to flee for his life the pastoral centre had cost more than 15 million rupees
7729924 we christians refuse violence we condemn every act of violence and terrorism but we are also against taking the law into our own hands
7729925 as soon as we heard about swami laxamananda saraswatis assassination i issued a public statement strongly condemning the dastardly attack and murders i called on everyone to remain peaceful and in harmony we want relations of friendship with all communities
7729926 we feel totally abandoned this morning the authorities sent three policemen to watch over the nuns convent and the bishops residence but they dont even have a stick to protect us from the fury of the mob
7729927 golwalkar a founding member of the rss in a book that he wrote borrowed ideas from hitlers nazism his admiration for hitler was well known he rejected the idea that india was a secular nation and posited instead that it was a hindu rashtra a hindu system which a great of influence over much of the indian population
7729928 more than 94 per cent of the population is hindu christianity is practiced by only 2 4 per cent of the population there have been some conversions though among tribals who have often been abused by the people of the cities
7729929 there were around 400 fpi members we akkbb gathered at the monas open area
7729930 there have been an increase in these attacks but they are indiscriminate attacks they are individual attacks
7729931 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
7729932 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals this is censorship and its sets a very bad precedent indeed
7729933 the latest showdown between islam and the western tradition of free speech
7729934 i will never buy another book published by random house
7729935 we are americans we are free to choose what we want to read
7729936 you cant reject your bronze medal youre stripped of it
7729937 el a o pasado esto era una crisis financiera que pens bamos quecon un poco de suerte podr a haberse superado en navidad pero se haalargado ya durante un a o y parece que se extender a n por un periodode tiempo considerable
7729938 perciban de la sociedad cualquier cantidad o beneficio por un concepto distinto de la remuneraci n de consejero salvo que no sea significativa
7729939 el d a de hoy entregamos a tiempo esta iniciativa pues consideramos que nuestra propuesta es la mejor y la m s viable porque no privatiza y s fortalece a pemex
7729940 to increase understanding of america to debunk some of the leading myths about the united states and to make a positive case for a continuing leading role for america in the world
7729941 while in britain and europe what he says isnt all that controversial in america his voice like so many other important ones has been pigeonholed
7729942 american military spending supports a string of regional alliances that provide security and keep the peace
7729943 no country has done more overall to promote democracy and human rights around the world than the united states
7729944 a morning that would have served as the kick off to a four day victory party had instead taken on the feel of a past tense tribute to new yorks leading lady
7729945 we all do have most of us almost all of us in this hall mixed emotions
7729946 its not like they are bankrolling his entire campaign but they pay him a large sum of money
7729947 i dont believe nawaz sharif should be called an islamist
7729948 i think at times in the 1990s he was connected to bin laden but we have to put this in the historical context now we need to be concerned that he might continue to have ties to people clearly not interested in working with the united states but at this point those people would not include al qaeda at the same time he has yet to see the fight against terrorism as a fight his party should take up
7729949 sharifs connections are to the religious parties and the religious establishment that has been part of the political system
7729950 he has no connections to people who would be considered terrorists before he was ousted by musharraf
7729951 he was in discussions with the united states and working together with our intelligence community to go after al qaeda
7729952 hes obsessed with cars and tractors during my days off i have to drive him around in this little golf cart which he calls a tractor its really funny
7729953 kalau kemarin pas harganya rp 3 000 seliter ya masih bisa terjangkaulah tapi sekarang udah mencapai rp 8 000 seliter waduh sangat bingung juga kalau mau masak mahalan beli minyak tanah dibandingkan beli beras
7729954 udah mah mahal susah lagi nyarinya untung saja saya mendapatkan meskipun jaraknya cukup jauh dan harus antri yang cukup panjang ya lumayanlah untuk satu hari juga harusnya pemerintah mensosialisasikan dulu kepada kita sebelum menaikkan harga suapaya kita bisa mencari jalan alternatifnya udah mah sekarang teh mau bulan puasa ga mikir pisan pemerintah teh
7729955 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7729956 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about before i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7729957 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7729958 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering at us anxiously in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7729959 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
7729960 this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house
7729961 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7729962 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7729963 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
7729964 barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7729965 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7729966 ive never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7729967 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama in our family hes known as uncle teddy more than any senator of his generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7729968 strongly denouncing sexism which sadly continues to be prevalent throughout our society
7729969 the presidents power to remove is critical to the presidents power to control the executive branch and perform his article ii responsibilities yet under this statute the president is two levels of for cause removal away from board members a previously unheard of restriction on and attenuation of the presidents authority over executive officers
7729970 we think its time now its to the point where the cars are in the park for so few hours that we cant do too much more than go car free and see what happens
7729971 it would really touch the lives of millions of people
7729972 saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
7729973 simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
7729974 remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of religion have so often been ignored silenced by historians
7729975 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
7729976 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7729977 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7729978 mccain knows obama denounced ayerss crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7729979 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7729980 she connected with our community in a way no candidate ever has
7729981 i came here to say thank you thank you for the support you gave me
7729982 on any issue that matters to you we must have a democratic president to make progress together
7729983 i know with all my heart that we cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies
7729984 i am asking you those of you who supported me i would be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me
7729985 let us remember what we were fighting for we were not just fighting to elect a particular person president we were fighting to take our country back we are on the same journey now
7729986 i hope this convention gives him a chance to redeem himself
7729987 in the past five or six months he hasnt behaved with the finesse weve come to expect from him
7729988 hes pushed things one step too far too many times
7729989 my opinion of his standing is not what people were experiencing at the time but peoples nostalgia for that time
7729990 estamos vivendo um ciclo de expans o do cr dito que est se mostrando coerente com o ciclo da economia principalmente nessa fase salutar porque hoje o crescimento do cr dito muito mais ligado a empresas onde h maior capital de giro sendo utilizado uma maior oferta sendo feita e um aumento da produtividade
7729991 passamos a consumir muito r pido o cr dito est crescendo a termos nominais isso significa que estamos demandando produtos e servi os numa velocidade fant stica mas a oferta n o t o r pida quanto o consumo
7729992 na medida em que voc tem cr dito voc consegue consumir aquilo que seria sua renda futura
7729993 evidentemente tomar cr dito tamb m significa um compromisso de pagamento portanto devemos saber tomar cr dito de forma equilibrada e racional e n o nos endividarmos ao extremo
7729994 cheque especial para curt ssimo prazo para situa es especiais
7729995 ao contr rio do observado em janeiro quando a eleva o do custo do cr dito foi atribu da ao aumento das al quotas dos impostos a alta em julho decorreu da eleva o da meta da taxa selic que contaminou o custo de capta o dos bancos e sobretudo do aumento do spread banc rio o que constitui sintoma de uma maior avers o ao risco dos bancos em especial no segmento de pessoa f sica diante do crescimento excessivo do cr dito h v rios meses
7729996 estou aqui como uma esposa que ama o marido e acredita que ele ser um presidente extraordin rio
7729997 barack e eu crescemos com muitos dos mesmos valores que uma pessoa trabalha duro pelo que quer na vida que a palavra dessa pessoa lei e que far o que disser que faz
7729998 ele foi criado por av s que pertenciam classe trabalhadora como meus pais e por uma m e que lutava para pagar as contas igual a n s
7729999 e disse que freq entemente aceitamos a dist ncia entre os dois e nos conformamos com o mundo como inclusive quando n o reflete nossos valores e aspira es
