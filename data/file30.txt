300000 the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said if any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes he should spit to his left three times seek refuge in allah from the shaytaan and turn over on to his other side
300001 he should seek refuge in allah from its evil so that it does not harm him
300002 i used to see dreams that weighed heavier on me than a mountain but as soon as i heard this hadeeth so i never worried about it again
300003 o prophet of allah i saw a dream that my head was chopped off and rolled away and i ran after it
300004 do not tell people the shaytaan is playing with you in your dreams
300005 if anyone sees something he dislikes he should get up and pray
300006 o allah show us the tuth as truth amp give us the ability to follow it amp show us the falsehood as falsehood amp give us the ability to avoid it
300007 allah the almighty has said o son of adam so long as you call upon me and hope in me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind o son of adam were your sins to reach the clouds in the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of me i shall forgive you o son of adam were you to come to me with an earthful of sins and were you then to face me asalam w3likum jazaki allah kahiran for sharing what if u keep having the same dream over and over again bad dream plz reply if u get the chance peace you know allaah yet you do not obey him you recite the qur aan yet you do not act according to it you know shaytaan yet you continue agreeing with him you claim to love the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam yet you abandon his sunnah guidance and way you claim to love paradise yet you do not work for it you claim to fear the fire yet you do not stop sinning you say indeed death it true yet you have not prepared for it you busy yourself with the faults of others yet you do not look at your own faults you eat the sustenance that allaah provides for you yet you are not grateful to him and you bury your dead yet you have not heeded its lesson
300008 do not tell people the shaytaan is playing with you in your dreams
300009 allah the almighty has said o son of adam so long as you call upon me and hope in me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind

300033 o messenger of allaah what clothes do you command us to wear in ihraam
300034 do not wear shirts pants or any kind of headgear and women in ihraam should not wear niqaab or gloves
300035 o allah show us the tuth as truth amp give us the ability to follow it amp show us the falsehood as falsehood amp give us the ability to avoid it
300036 if you start seeing kids in your neighborhood with frilly slingshots call undercover police
300037 authorities say their use of a taser weapon should not be questioned
300038 o you who believe fear allaah as he should be feared and die not except in a state of islam as muslims with complete submission to allaah
300039 o mankind be dutiful to your lord who created you from a single person adam and from him he created his wife hawwa and from them both he created many men and women and fear allaah through whom you demand your mutual rights and do not cut the relations of the wombs kinship surely allaah is ever an all watcher over you
300040 o you who believe keep your duty to allaah and fear him and speak always the truth he will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins and whosoever obeys allaah and his messenger he has indeed achieved a great achievement i e he will be saved from the hell fire and made to enter paradise
300041 the heart qalb takes its name from its constant changes taqallub the likeness of the heart is that of a feather at the root of a tree being turned over and over by the wind
300042 the likeness of the heart is that of a feather in an empty plot of land being blown over and over by the wind
300043 the heart of the son of adam changes more quickly than a pan of rapidly boiling water
300044 it changes more than a pot of rapidly boiling water
300045 the hearts of the children of adam are as one between the fingers of the most merciful and he turns them in whatever way he wills
300046 o allaah controller of the hearts direct our hearts to obey you
300047 allaah comes in between a person and his heart i
300048 except him who brings to allaah a clean heart free from shirk and hypocrisy
300049 who feared the most beneficent allaah in the unseen i e in the worldly life before seeing and meeting him and brought a heart turned in repentance to him
300050 all of my ummah will be fine except for those who commit sin openly an example of which is a man who does something at night and when morning comes and allaah has concealed his sin he says o so and so i did such and such yesterday his lord had covered his sin all night but he has uncovered what allaah had concealed
300051 then after that your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness
300052 does not accept the duaa of one whose heart is heedless of him
300053 and when they stand up for prayer they stand up with laziness
300054 people will keep holding back from being in the first row of congregational prayers until allaah throws them into the fire
300055 they used to hasten on to do good deeds and they used to call on us with hope and fear and used to humble themselves before us
300056 one who makes friends and with whom others feel comfortable there is no goodness in one who does not make friends and with whom others do not feel comfortable
300057 the heart will be subjected to trial after trial and there will appear a black stain on any heart that is affected which will spread until the heart is completely black and sealed as it were so that it will not recognize any good deed or denounce any evil except whatever suits its own desires
300058 if sin is committed on earth the one who witnesses it and hates it one time he said denounces it will be like one who knew nothing of it whoever does not witness it but approves of it will be like one who witnesses it
300059 you will be very keen to be leaders but you will regret it on the day of resurrection for although it seems easy in the beginning it becomes a hardship later on literally the breastfeeding is a luxury but weaning is miserable
300060 if you wish i could tell you about leadership and what it is firstly it is blame secondly it is regret and thirdly it is punishment on the day of resurrection except for one who is just
300061 whoever feels happy to have the slaves of allaah stand up for him let him occupy his house in hellfire
300062 sit down for i heard the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him say whoever likes to have men stand up for him let him take his place in hellfire
300063 no man should make another get up from his place so that he can sit in it
300064 and they gave them the muhaajiroon preference over themselves even though they were in need of that
300065 stinginess and faith never exist together in the heart of the believer
300066 beware of stinginess for those who came before you were destroyed because of stinginess it commanded them to be miserly so they were miserly it commanded them to cut family ties so they cut them and it commanded them to be immoral so they were immoral
300067 behold you are those who are called to spend in the cause of allaah yet among you are some who are niggardly and whoever is niggardly it is only at the expense of his own self but allaah is rich free of all wants and you mankind are poor and if you turn away from islam and the obedience of allaah he will exchange for you some other people and they will not be your likes
300068 o you who believe why do you say that which you do not do most hateful is it with allaah that you say that which you do not do
300069 will this be counted as a sin or is it only makrooh
300070 whoever falls into doubtful matters falls into haraam like a shepherd who grazes his flock around a place where he is not allowed he will soon enter it
300071 is it very haraam or not how much sin is involved
300072 i will certainly recognize people who will come on the day of resurrection bringing good deeds as great as the white mountain of tuhaamah and allaah may he be glorified will make it like dust in the air
300073 o messenger of allaah describe them to us and explain this so that we will not unwittingly be among them
300074 they are your brothers and they look like you they pray at night as you do but if they had the opportunity to violate the limits set by allaah they would do so
300075 the believer sees his sins as if he were sitting beneath a mountain which he fears will fall on him whilst the sinner sees his sins as if it were a fly passing his nose and he says such and such to it
300076 i came to the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him and said o messenger of allaah we are a desert people
300077 a man passed a branch of a tree lying in the road and said by allaah i want to remove this out of the way of the muslims so that it will not hurt them and he was admitted to paradise
300078 whoever removes something harmful from the path of the muslims one hasanah will be recorded for him and whoever has a hasanah accepted will enter paradise
300079 i heard the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him say whoever removes a stone from the road one hasanah will be recorded for him and whoever has a hasanah will enter paradise
300080 the believers position in relation to his fellow believers is like that of the head to the body the believer feels the pain of his fellow believers as the body reacts to the pain suffered by the head
300081 no two people are friends for the sake of allaah or in islam but they will be split apart by the first sin according to another report they will only be split apart by the first sin committed by either of them
300082 not one grain of wheat will reach you from al yamaamah except with the permission of the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him
300083 no people will go astray after having being guided except that they become argumentative
300084 i guarantee a house in the outskirts of paradise to the one who forsakes argument even when he is in the right
300085 eeman and hasad do not exist together in the heart of the true slave
300086 beware of luxury for the slaves of allaah do not live a life of luxury
300087 has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to be affected by allaahs reminder this quraan and that which has been revealed of the truth lest they become as those who received the scripture before i e jews and christians and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened and many of them were faasiqoon rebellious disobedient to allaah
300088 our brothers are dearer to us than our families for our families remind us of this world but our brothers remind us of the hereafter
300089 we looked at our hearts and felt that there had been a deep change
300090 he is doomed the slave of the dinar and the slave of the dirham
300091 all that is sufficient for any one of you in this world is the supply of the traveller
300092 allaah may he be glorified says we have sent down wealth for the establishment of prayer and the payment of zakaat but if the son of adam has one valley he will wish that he had a second and if he had two valleys he would wish that he had a third the stomach of the son of adam will be filled only with dust i e he is never satisfied then allaah will accept the repentance of the one who repents
300093 and know that your possessions and children are but a trial and that surely with allaah is a mighty reward
300094 beautified for men is the love of things they covet women children much of gold and silver wealth branded beautiful horses cattle and well tilled land this is the pleasure of the present worlds life but allaah has the excellent return paradise
300095 in this world women and good scents have been made dear to me but dearest of all to me is prayer
300096 children are the cause of grief cowardice ignorance and miserliness
300097 my children deserve the money i will leave it for them when i die so he is miserly in the sense that he refrains from spending it for the sake of allaah
300098 you will be killed and will die and your children will become orphans lost and alone
300099 every nation has its fitnah trial or temptation and the fitnah of my ummah is wealth
300100 two hungry wolves sent against the sheep do not do more damage to them than a mans eagerness for wealth and standing does to his religion
300101 all that you need of wealth is a servant and a means of transportation to go out for the sake of allaah
300102 woe to those who want to accumulate wealth except for the one who says with his wealth here here here i e giving it away to one on his right one on his left one in front of him and one behind him
300103 leave them to eat and enjoy and let them be preoccupied with false hope they will come to know
300104 what i fear for you is following your desires and hoping for a long life for following ones desires makes a man ignore the truth and hoping for a long life makes him forget the hereafter
300105 four things are causes of doom dry eyes i e never weeping a hard heart hope for a long life and eagerness for this world
300106 and the term was prolonged for them and their hearts were hardened
300107 whoever does not hope for a long life will have less worries and his heart will be filled with light because he calls death to mind and strives to obey allaah
300108 whoever eats too much drinks too much and sleeps too much loses a great reward
300109 do not laugh too much for excessive laughter deadens the heart
300110 faith wears out in the heart of any one of you just as clothes wear out so ask allaah to renew the faith in your hearts
300111 it was reported by al tabaraani in al kabeer and its isnaad is saheeh
300112 there is no heart that is not covered by a cloud like the cloud covering the moon when it is shining and so it suddenly goes dark but when it the cloud goes away it shines again
300113 that they may grow more in faith along with their present faith
300114 which of you has had his faith increased by it
300115 whoever among you sees an evil action let him change it by his hand by action and if he cannot then by his tongue by speaking out and if he cannot then by his heart by feeling that it is wrong and that is the weakest of faith
300116 one of the signs of proper understanding is when a slave takes care of his eemaan and pays attention to what decreases it and knows when it increases and when it decreases and recognizes the temptation of shaytaan when he comes to him
300117 every deed has energy and strength and then this energy and strength is followed by a slackening so whos slackening is in accordance to my sunnah he will be fine and whos slackening is to other than that i e doing unlawful or forebidden deeds he will be doomed
300118 and we send down from the quraan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe
300119 if you punish them they are your slaves and if you forgive them verily you only you are the all mighty the all wise
300120 ubayd allaah ibn umayr and i entered upon aaishah may allaah be pleased with her and ubayd allaah ibn umayr said tell us of the most wonderful thing you saw on the part of the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him
300121 by allaah i love to be near you and i love what makes you happy
300122 o messenger of allaah are you weeping when allaah has forgiven all of your sins past and future
300123 soorat hood and it you know allaah yet you do not obey him you recite the qur aan yet you do not act according to it you know shaytaan yet you continue agreeing with him you claim to love the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam yet you abandon his sunnah guidance and way you claim to love paradise yet you do not work for it you claim to fear the fire yet you do not stop sinning you say indeed death it true yet you have not prepared for it you busy yourself with the faults of others yet you do not look at your own faults you eat the sustenance that allaah provides for you yet you are not grateful to him and you bury your dead yet you have not heeded its lesson

300138 the shaytaan comes between me and my salaah and causes me to falter in my recitation
300139 that is a shaytaan devil called khanzab if you sense his presence seek refuge with allaah and spit dry spitting to your left three times
300140 if something happens to you during salaah men should say subhaan allaah and women should clap
300141 tasbeeh saying subhaan allaah is for men and clapping is for women

300144 the swells got to about 7m and the captain turned the ship so we were going with the swell rather than against it the captain then told us we were going to turn to get back on to a safer course and it was in that manoeuvre that we hit two waves at once
300145 unfortunately it was enough to smash crockery and send tables flying some people were injured but some just panicked i think it was more a mental thing
300146 there were people with some more serious injuries needing medical assistance but i dont know the details
300147 some people were freaking out but all the crew were saying was to go down below to our cabins because there would be less rocking and so people who needed treatment got it quickly
300148 i felt sorry for the crew they fed everyone made sure we were all okay and they were happy the whole time they really stepped up it probably increased my respect for them
300149 not only would going fully metric cost a fortune to implement in britain it would also not go down well with a majority of the motoring public
300150 as a result of keeping an eye on increasing prices motorists now seem to understand the fuel price in litres
300151 it does seem odd that we buy our fuel in litres but think about fuel efficiency in miles per gallon we appear to be an imperial metric nation

300154 interest is coming from everywhere for the xebra even places you wouldnt expect like the big sky state where people are just as concerned about high gas prices
300155 even after counting emissions from electric generating plants xebras produce 98 percent fewer pollutants than gas cars
300156 the approximate cost to operate the vehicle is 1 to 3 cents per mile
300157 he had seen other electric cars before but it was the first time he had seen a xebra and thought it was neat im grateful for the governors initiative and that the state of montana is stepping up to use more electric vehicles

300160 the actions taken on june 23 2008 and our subsequent submission to finra on june 9 2008 are the result of control shareholder and aete new management having exhausted all avenues to interdict the conduct of ongoing criminal activities perpetrated by former officers and or directors and their associates of the alternative energy technology center inc f k a mortgage xpress inc
300161 aete has been in close contact with the securities exchange commission finra and various state regulatory and enforcement agencies cooperating and providing related information ever since control shareholder and new management discovered the criminal activities of jonathan gilchrist william carmichael and their cohorts
300162 the company and new management intend to vigorously and systematically pursue all those that have been engaged directly or indirectly in this illegal activity which has caused substantial losses to the company its investors and stockholders and significant damage to the reputation of aete and its business enterprise
300163 it was discovered during an investigation undertaken by control shareholder new management and myself that beginning the first week of january and continuing into july 2008 aete had been targeted for use as a conduit in ongoing criminal activities related to microcap stock fraud by former officers and or directors of aete and their associates from on or about february 22 2008 the control shareholder new management and i have been in regular contact with the securities exchange commission enforcement division providing complete documentation on our internal investigation as it developed the development of significant information on the disposition of the reg d 504 stock offering came about through the analysis of a stock and money laundering scheme initiated by jonathan gilchrist william carmichael david mordekhay and shir doron of petach tikva israel
300164 on information and belief jonathan gilchrist transferred to shir doron shares of the reg
300165 para mi esto no es un problema de encuestas simplemente hay que tener paciencia no tener nerviosismo no creer que manipulando informaci n se puede conseguir la repuesta final a todo este proceso

300167 there is no requirement on how much they can charge you could almost say it is a licence to print money
300168 we welcome the announcement that the sia are to look at a compulsory scheme for those companies that are vehicle immobilisers and are keen to work with them
300169 wheel clamping on private land has been a major problem for some years
300170 the governments view is that owners of land must be able to take action against those who park without permission and that wheel clamping may be an effective way of dealing with such situations but that any action must be carried out in a reasonable manner
300171 it has become clear since 2005 that the powers of the sia do not address the concerns felt by some regarding the behaviour of vehicle immobilisers
300172 for this reason the home office has asked the sia to consider various options for the regulation of vehicle immobilisation companies in the private sector including a company registration scheme
300173 tastes like shit for the first half then fine for the second half
300174 i expect it to be just as fun as last year i want to meet new friends and have a really good time
300175 its amazing it means a lot ive been counting down my days to go to pennsylvania and its going to be really fun
300176 i only threw 163 0 at the local meet so it was really surprising i improved by that much theres some footwork involved in the softball throw you have to get as much of your whole body into it as you can to make it go far
300177 im going to be wearing a knee brace for the meet
300178 it only hurts when i twist it the wrong way
300179 i threw 161 in practice and my goal is to throw 165 170 at nationals its going to take a lot of arm
300180 the amusement park is awesome and the chocolate factory is cool
300181 im going to ride as many roller coasters as i can
300182 the team that is going to win this series is the one that takes advantage of the most situations theyre in
300183 tonight roseburg took advantage of what we gave them tonight
300184 they hung around and fought back a couple of times
300185 you let a team like that hang around and they can hurt you
300186 brandon managed a good game and pitched us to where we needed to be
300187 dakota came in and threw a beautiful game and the offense responded when it had to
300188 ive gone into some pressure situations the last few weeks but i enjoy it
300189 he kept the ball low and i usually hit the ball pretty good when its low in the zone
300190 you just try to minimize the damage and get back to batting thats just baseball
300191 the only fishing that seems to be going on now is for smallmouth bass we havent seen any steelhead were anxiously awaiting the fall fish hopefully by the end of the month well see some coho jacks some mature coho some fall chinook and then winter steelhead about the first part of november
300192 the water is still a lot higher than it normally is but people are getting into some nice size bass the bass are probably averaging a pound or so with a few in the 2 to 2 1 2 range
300193 theres not a lot of angling pressure just a few weekend warriors gettng into the bass its a lot quieter than it normally is
300194 some walks errors and offensively we didnt get the key hit well have to forget about those things and move on
300195 well just stay the course come out tomorrow and its a new day
300196 we just need to make sure we are ready to go offensively and defensively
300197 nobody succeeds beyond his or her wildest expectations unless he or she begins with some wild expectations
300198 climate is what we expect weather is what we get
300199 the lords delight is in those who fear him those who put their hope in his unfailing love
300200 we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanical aid but by an infinite expectation of the dawn
300201 the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn that shines brighter and brighter until the full day
300202 recently the working relationship between the city council and myself has deteriorated to the point where we were spending more energy dealing with those issues than dealing with the issues that need to be addressed for the benefit of the community and the benefit of the municipal organization
300203 if i had treated an employee the way they had treated me i would have been fired
300204 i think the council did everything they could to do it well and accurately and to best represent our concerns and the city of reedsport
300205 disappointed that we are losing a city manager that we are losing this city manager
300206 its pretty fun ive never had the experience to play with so many good athletes like this everybody out there works hard and wants to play
300207 as they shriners told us its more than a football game
300208 were playing to help the kids who have a great need and that makes it more meaningful and special
300209 its a tremendous honor being selected for this game because of the talent we have here this is the best group of talent ive ever played with and its great helping out a good cause as well
300210 im excited about the game it has been a while since ive played

300478 her household allowance was generous and so was her dress allowance he liked her to be well dressed but it was bitter that moment when he handed her the money in its separate envelopes she had earned her own living since she was eighteen and perhaps of the by now many things that dismayed her about her marriage it was that moment that money handed her with a smile that dismayed her most
300479 he had been our destroyer the doer of things we dreamed of doing but could not bring ourselves to do
300480 what is very damaging sometimes is that the player gets bad publicity against his own fans for things he has not said that is sometimes difficult to repair there is disappointment from the fans because they feel the player wants to go but all i can say is that when i was face to face with him he always said his priority was to stay at the club and i told him that he has got his priorities right

300511 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
300512 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
300513 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
300514 tell us all again about this lawyer in mass you have ready to sue me is there a reason why you wont name him her besides the reason there isnt any lawyer and its just you spewing another cowardly impotent threat just what is stopping u
300515 i didnt really agree with it i feel like hes given a lot i feel like hes one of the greatest hitters in the mlb
300516 to give him up in a pennant race is tough i dont know what happened behind the scenes but its tough i thought he brought a lot to red sox nation
300517 its a shame that you always give someone up in the year of free agency they should have held onto him until the end of the year wow eight years
300518 we miss manny we liked manny best pure hitter in the major leagues
300519 i dont think they should have traded him but it happens

300531 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
300532 im on four different medications three of them are brand new and its the first time that ive ever been non detectible
300533 im down to about just for the hiv about nine pills per day five in the morning and four at night
300534 the virus is truly complex and has many tricks up its sleeve
300535 the virus needs at least one constant region and that is the essence of calling it the achilles heel
300536 what we already have in our hand are the abzymes that we could be infusing into the human subjects with hiv infection essentially to move the virus
300537 that is the worry of the researcher this is what nightmares are made of that after 30 years of work you find it doesnt work
300538 this is the holy grail of hiv research to develop a preventative vaccine
300539 if we can get the viral loads down to a manageable level that will preclude the need for these conventional drugs
300540 there are so many people struggling with the disease because it affects not only your body but also your psyche how you perceive yourself

300561 i wish the press would leave all our families out of this campaign
300562 churlish and unlike mccain and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election
300563 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
300564 attacking too much and indiscriminately the barrage undermines his brand takes time away from telling voters what he might do for them and looks awfully old timey in a year when voters want a new brand

300574 opposed to the israeli annexation of east sic jerusalem and the extension of israeli law on it and the extension of jerusalems municipal boundaries
300575 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
300576 as a practical matter it would be very difficult to execute
300577 i continued to say that jerusalem will be the capital of israel and i have said that before and i will say it again and i also have said that it is important that we dont simply slice the city in half but ive also said that thats a final status issue

300589 this notion that somehow weve had wild shifts in my positions is simply inaccurate
300590 solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
300591 not prove to be one that changes the dynamics significantly
300592 the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true
300593 i dont have doubts about my ability to apply sound judgment to the major national security problems that we face
300594 if youre a school teacher getting off at 4 00 p m it would be tough to get to our office by 5 00 p m by 6 00 p m you can do that if you work retail were open at 7 00 p m and you can show up on your way to work
300595 you have more than 800 services available on line you dont even have to ever enter a government building
300596 we had over a million people in the d m v offices that could have taken care of business on line or through mail

300599 it the housing bill can help people who are at risk of losing their home stay in their homes
300600 hopefully if we have some stability in the rate of foreclosure if it slows down people start getting a little more confident banks start lending again to credit worthy borrowers and we stop seeing property values continuing to decline
300601 once you start talking about working folks there are a lot of people who are seeing their premiums co payments deductibles going up and up and up we need to work with their employers to lower those premiums
300602 they have nothing constructive to say so their last resort is to attack me
300603 the performance is good however it would be nice to see the camera able to capture more than 3 images at a time both in burst and single shot modes the image quality both indoors and out is excellent with vivid natural colors
300604 overall the kodak z1012 is usually succeeds in producing nice pictures but some parts of the camera just get in the way at the end of the day for me judging a camera comes down to its ability to produce a good image on this score this camera is generally a success

300608 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
300609 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
300610 this important issue will welcome india into the nonproliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
300611 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime

300618 se es uno de los problemas fundamentales que todav a debemos confrontar en am rica latina
300619 luchar contra el estigma y la discriminaci n hacia las poblaciones m s vulnerables que son tambi n las m s afectadas requiere un enorme esfuerzo de nuestra parte no solamente porque atentan contra los derechos humanos sino adem s porque le est n haciendo muy pocos favores a la lucha contra la epidemia
300620 el problema es que lo que se haga en prevenci n hoy no dar frutos de inmediato y habitualmente los pol ticos no suelen pensar a largo plazo sino s lo en lo que tiene que ver con su t rmino
300621 para nosotros prevenci n y tratamiento est n muy vinculados
300622 y en el portafolio de estrategias que tenemos que utilizar est n desde los cambios de conducta y el uso amplio de preservativos hasta la b squeda todav a frustrada de microbicidas y vacunas asociado al uso de terapia antirretroviral
300623 estamos a s lo dos a os de 2010 que es cuando se ha comprometido la comunidad internacional a proveer acceso universal a la terapia antirretroviral afirma cahn y todav a estamos muy lejos de eso
300624 the tsm program is a world class example of the leadership role an industry association can play in promoting sustainable development
300625 it meets or exceeds best practice on the key benchmarks we examined and the program is well positioned to help macs members respond to market expectations on the sustainability performance of materials in the 21st century
300626 i would like to see as much of this as possible and particularly power to our mining industry to be carbon free renewable energy
300627 as south australia moves into a fully fledged mining construction and production boom over the coming years its energy needs will be critical
300628 given the size of south australias mineral assets any delays to these projects caused by inadequate power supply wouldnt just be a local concern it would have a medium to long term impact on the performance of the national economy
300629 fortunately these burgeoning energy requirements can be met through the vast resources of renewable energy available in our outback which are already located close to many of our major mineral provinces
300630 below the thin layer of racial and ethnic chauvinism religion and politics the real reason for many conflicts is the struggle for the access to and control of the limited resources on our planet
300631 when we manage our resources sustainably and practice good governance we deliberately and consciously promote cultures of peace
300632 we can build a strong economy invest in our people and maintain the nations precious natural treasures
300633 have largely been to blame for most of the past and current misfortunes visited on the congolese people
300634 the countrys forests and minerals will once again be prey for deadly predators and the people of the drc will be doomed to repeat their tragic cycle
300635 formidable struggle of unrelenting violent protests including oil theft pipeline sabotage and kidnappings
300636 two things were paramount in our mind in the entire chain of events one environment health safety and second corporate social responsibility we are operating in an area around which there are villages below poverty line they are not exposed to the modern world no competency and opportunity for people work we started working in these areas specially for competence building agriculture consulting guidance seed health supply of water during water scarcity
300637 mining is like making sausages we all enjoy the end result but no one wants to see where it comes from
300638 nei test di jerez abbiamo capito tutto siamo qui per vincere
300639 la pista era molto sporca stamani quindi abbiamo aspettato prima di iniziare il nostro programma ancora una volta la vettura e apparsa buona anche se ho incontrato molto traffico in entrambe le sessioni questo pomeriggio ho anche provato per la prima volta il nuovo pacchetto aerodinamico sembra senza dubbio aver reso piu bilanciata la vettura il che e molto incoraggiante

300642 mr michael smith fails to see the big picture overstreet mall is more than a series of pedestrian bridges connecting coffee shops and newsstands think of it rather as effectively bringing millions of square feet of office space under one roof i know of no other u s city east of the mississippi where more office space not to mention hotels parking retail performing arts centers and residential buildings can be accessed under cover
300643 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

300648 if the homeowner is in foreclosure how he can possibly buy his home back
300649 submit your best offer because the lender is looking at other bids
300650 property was listed for 899k then dropped to 839k then 789k 759k and finally 599k which created a spike in buyers the price was raised to 679k and the house is now under contract but the final price was not revealed
300651 children with dyslexia dysgraphia dyspraxia attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder aspergers syndrome and autism and meares irlen syndrome are still not being identified in the scottish education system
300652 early diagnosis and early intervention by teachers who have been trained in how to teach children with these conditions can substantially improve not only the academic potential but also the behaviour of these children
300653 if they are identified there are ways to teach them if they are not identified they end up thinking they are just not clever and could turn to crime or become unemployed
300654 the aim of this is really to prevent the next generation being missed
300655 this should be addressed during programmes of initial teacher education but local authorities must ensure that professional development opportunities are available to allow existing teachers to update their skills
300656 with the introduction of the additional support for learning act all local authorities are legally required to provide an appropriate level of support for all pupils with such needs
300657 it is absolutely crucial that all children with autism receive the right support at the right time
300658 we would welcome any measure that ensures that their needs are identified as early as possible
300659 children have a legal right to an education that develops their personality talents mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential
300660 it is important that we can identify anything that gets in the way of achieving that aim so we can give appropriate support
300661 it is also important that we avoid too many intrusive tests that might stigmatise a child so it is really a question of finding a balance
300662 early intervention is meant to screen children for all sorts of difficulties and parents now have the right to ask for assessment legally which they didnt have before
300663 they dont however have the right to expect that the test is done
300664 many of our members have children with additional needs and we would certainly welcome early assessment not nearly enough is being invested in additional support for learning
300665 the scottish government believes that the early years are the best time to provide support for children allowing any problems to be identified and tackled early and prevent them from being disadvantaged in later life
300666 veronique is one of a new breed of olives so well suited to more northern climates that it will produce a crop of olives in most british summers
300667 hardy down to 20c so it can be grown just about anywhere in britain it makes a high quality olive oil although we suspect you may not be able to make much from one tree highly decorative it does well in poor stony soils so is a great choice for that awkward spot where little else flourishes
300668 while veronique will withstand extremely low temperatures it is important that gardeners grow it in free draining soil or compost that does not become waterlogged in winter
300669 it might make a nice shrub or bush but i wouldnt bet on enjoying regular olives to drop in your martini glass
300670 its technically possible but i think the likelihood is minimal
300671 olives in scotland im not so sure olives taste disgusting off the vine you have to process them and i doubt people will go to all that effort id say this is a curiosity rather than a new industry for scotland
300672 the result is a report which is misleading and unfortunately the rspb seem more intent on an agenda against gamekeepers than giving a true picture
300673 the rspb should put aside what seems to be a persecution of gamekeepers and sporting estates and join with the people who work in scotlands countryside to find solutions to wildlife crime and bird persecution
300674 we are absolutely not pursuing an agenda of persecution against gamekeepers
300675 i think we are being quite honest and open about this issue and to try and project that we are not is little bit unfair
300676 one of the reasons we have seen an increase in the number of crimes reported is that more people including gamekeepers are increasingly reporting incidents of criminality against birds of prey
300677 we are 100 per cent with the rspb in wanting to stop bird of prey crime
300678 but we have got to work with cast iron cases rather than hearsay we have got to work with the facts
300679 i think progress has been made and i dont want to get into this tit for tat knocking lumps out of each other that doesnt do anyone any favours
300680 persecuting any form of wildlife is a crime i particularly dislike the use of poison because its indiscriminate
300681 my biggest concern is what happens if a kid is out playing
300682 if they come across this bait and start poking about at it and get it on their fingers they could become ill
300683 citizens of dumfriesshire will be sickened and disgusted that their countryside and its reputation is still being tarnished by a few selfish individuals
300684 when great efforts are being made to attract visitors to rural areas the negative message of an illegally poisoned countryside is the last thing we need whilst the effect on wildlife is appalling
300685 these latest figures are significantly worse than this time last year rising fuel and energy prices an increase in cost of food together with a slowdown in the housing market are having a real effect and consumers are now struggling to pay back their loans

300687 because the tide came in the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
300688 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds unfortunately its not the outcome people would want but its the right decision for the animal its sick and distressed
300689 it has chosen to strand both times we now know its not a navigational error but it has stranded for a reason it is sick if this animal was left it would have a much longer lingering death
300690 theres no coming back from renal failure its not good news but is what we expect from these cases
300691 renal failure is predominantly due to dehydration because it hasnt eaten for at least 48 hours but it could well be longer than that
300692 it is very sad but something that we are used to
300693 its very very unusual we have had seals before but never a whale
300694 i confirm our ambition is to be a major actor in the nuclear renaissance in the uk
300695 our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal british energy still has potential sites and sites are available from the nuclear decommissioning authority
300696 time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
300697 new nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the governments energy strategy but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control
300698 im overwhelmed i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
300699 we are obviously delighted with the outcome today that we feel is the only sensible verdict that the jury could have made on the evidence before them
300700 this is not a time to celebrate barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer
300701 we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
300702 be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
300703 very damaged by all this and find it difficult to come to terms with his notoriety
300704 just as likely the particle came from some extraneous source as it was that it came from a gun fired by the appellant
300705 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
300706 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
300707 the investigation be reopened and the person actually responsible for her murder be found
300708 our biggest concern is that the inquests will now be postponed and also the isc report
300709 it is much worse for the bereaved because they need to have an inquest they need to know and its still hanging over them and because it is still hanging over them it is still hanging over us the survivors because we are all in this together
300710 the victims the bereaved and the public are entitled to know the full facts behind the worst terrorist atrocity on the uk mainland they are entitled to know whether or not the bombings could have been prevented and they are entitled to know whether lessons have been learned
300711 this is important to note because despite hosting the olympic games china has been undeterred in undertaking massive housing rights violations and promises to continue along this path once the games are over
300712 the olympic games is a huge event for china but its significance should not be exaggerated the extent of globalisation has already been felt in china so a single event like the games although significant will not bring revolution or change the way the country is governed
300713 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
300714 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
300715 the risk is that once they open up the country to thousands of journalists they will find a side of china the government does not want them to see or show the world
300716 china has never been indifferent to the rest of the world and has been poised to westernise before
300717 but it has lost interest drawn back or succumbed to internal stresses
300718 its record of relations with the wider world as opposed to relations with its immediate neighbours has been exemplary we should be vigilant patient not panicky
300719 there is a story i like to tell about a journalist working in china who had his mother visit
300720 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
300721 the main driver behind fare increases will be the high oil price its very clear that the industry is going to have to reflect this high price
300722 we have already raised concerns that scotlands flights to londons airports seem expendable ahead of all others
300723 its worrying that ba appears to be pulling in its horns with a bit of jiggery pokery these complex proposals seem to guarantee their landing slots without guaranteeing passengers the present level of service
300724 i just thought last week it was a real flat 80 minutes for us the warriors were really good but there were some things we did a lot better tonight than we did last week
300725 our performance last week probably helped put the titans out of the equation for us
300726 we just wanted a better performance than last week and certainly i think we did that
300727 hes a great player and hes worth whatever he gets paid
300728 melbourne couldnt have played much better in the first half
300729 i hope the games spirited confrontational at times and its last man standing thats what i hope and thats what ill talk to them about
300730 shauns fairly uncontrollable before the game he gets all excited pre match in the rooms
300731 shaun would just like the guys to play the way he does it will be emotional and hopefully the team can hold him in good stead
300732 im sure the way john coaches theyre ready for it
300733 it really hit home when i came to watch the rugby union two weeks ago when australia played south africa and there was a sea of yellow here barracking for australia
300734 i dont know how john finds it but when you go interstate on the road you certainly feel the crowd so obviously that will affect players from the opposition absolutely
300735 many of our clients have spent countless marketing dollars with little success
300736 the game was right on there at the eight or 10 minute mark of the third quarter there was only a couple of goals in it
300737 to respond in the manner they did was really pleasing because we knew it would be a really tough contest
300738 collingwood with their backs against the wall are probably the most dangerous side in the competition and to get a convincing victory like that in the end was a real credit to the way our guys carried out the game
300739 hawthorns attack have got the capabilities im not going to be surprised that one day franklin breaks that record for the number of goals 18 kicked in one game that will never surprise me
300740 you cant give him opportunity if its not him its roughead they kicked 12 goals out of 17
300741 franklins better than any of our defenders but thats not a slur on nick maxwell i thought that he showed enormous courage in the third quarter onwards
300742 i thought we started really well and controlled all the things we needed to
300743 we were probably guilty of taking our foot off the pedal a little bit which was disappointing
300744 they melbourne are a very good side and theyre just trying to hit their straps after origin and i still maintain they are the benchmark
300745 we just probably need to improve in a few areas
300746 i guess the positive is we were a long way off our best footy i thought that was pretty obvious to see were a far more capable team than that
300747 hes in a bad way its a really really nasty cut down to the skull
300748 recognised the right of the scottish people to decide their constitutional future
300749 mr salmond has to act in a responsible manner when he brings forward his ideas on that because at the moment we dont have the detail we dont have any guarantee that its a neverendum
300750 he alex salmond has also got his own credit crunch coming along
300751 it is coming in terms of the financing of this country
300752 i will be a bold scottish leader my fellow scots ill focus my energies on making your hopes and your ambitions reality i will fear no one and i will do whatever it takes to deliver these promises
300753 we scottish labour face a hell of a challenge we all know where weve been we all know things have gone wrong but from this point on its about the future we have an opportunity to work together to win again it is an opportunity i am ready to seize
300754 i believe that your background should not have to determine your future
300755 id like to see a substantial expansion in student bursaries the snps abolition of the graduate endowment will not help talented bright young people from less affluent backgrounds get into university in the first place
300756 i want to rebuild the party but i want to do that with a view to getting the message across to people in parts of scotland particularly where we have for whatever reason lost contact with them
300757 alex salmond has got his day of reckoning as first minister
300758 it is important that as liberal democrats we have our own distinctive brand and policies
300759 my manifesto offers exactly that especially on our constitutional future
300760 for heavens sake lets get serious of course we can win with gordon as our leader
300761 un tueur gages pour liminer un contr leur du fisc

300765 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
300766 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors we shouted for them rescue teams to save us
300767 what happened was a dreadful tragedy mr mcgregor has been deprived of his wife and the children of their mother
300768 a new law is being passed next year to enable tonga to make the next step in its democratic transition which is a wonderful thing for the pacific
300769 the trips organised for november will likely be the last the subsidy of 200 per person can make a huge difference between someone going or not going
300770 this government has provided record funding and freed up local authority budgets so that they have the freedom to consider the contribution that study opportunities such as visits to auschwitz might contribute to meeting agreed national outcomes and make them available to pupils
300771 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
300772 the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
300773 it has no effect nor does it require a change to the australian labor partys long standing approach of not exporting uranium to a country thats not a party to the npt
300774 if we were to change our policy approach on uranium it would seriously undermine the nuclear non proliferation treaty we want that treaty to be enhanced
300775 well take a positive and constructive approach and we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind
300776 but we will also take into account the strategic importance of the arrangement to both india and the united states
300777 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
300778 the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
300779 its become even easier to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven
300780 there will be joint action between the unions commencing with an all out strike on wednesday 20 august this is due to the employers failure to properly address the issue of low pay within scottish local government
300781 there is a bigger issue here some of our members get only 8p more than the minimum wage and this needs to be dealt with
300782 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
300783 inflation is at 4 6 per cent and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster by as much as 14 per cent just this week gas prices went up 35 per cent
300784 our members need a fair offer from their employers we have a window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes i hope the employers take it
300785 i believe that our current differences are best resolved through negotiation and i and the employers negotiating team are always available for constructive discussion that takes us towards a mutually agreed solution
300786 were it open to me to send you to prison for 12 months i would not hesitate to do so
300787 he realises that is something he will have to live with for the rest of his life and it is something he is finding it difficult to come to terms with
300788 we have 29 families lined up for allotments and they are all desperate to get going and get started
300789 there are some tourist areas that are four to five miles away from the fire but we dont think they are in danger
300790 the starting point of the fire was near a stream which tourists use for rafting
300791 this is one of the biggest fires in antalyas history in terms of area affected and the biggest area in terms of damage it has caused
300792 mccormick and schmicks seafood restaurants is an equal opportunity employer
300793 sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of a political nature and should be promptly removed
300794 strong positive signal that the only way is negotiation and dialogue
300795 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
300796 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
300797 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
300798 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
300799 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
300800 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
300801 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
300802 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
300803 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
300804 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
300805 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
300806 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
300807 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
300808 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
300809 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
300810 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
300811 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
300812 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
300813 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia

300820 we were having some fun with our supporters that we sent it out to and were gonna display a sense of humor in this campaign
300821 ive repeated my admiration and respect for senator obama i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest im we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it and that is what campaigns are going to be like
300822 i think his comments were clearly were clearly the race card because of what he said
300823 the price of diesel has shot a huge hole in metros budget
300824 we are 22 million worse off than we thought we were going to be just because of the price of diesel
300825 we are not going to solve our problem through the fare box alone
300826 its going to be up to the legislature and the citizens
300827 you have an 85 percent chance of being diagnosed and your odds arent very good

300832 esta es una camiseta que quiero por eso mi decisi n fue siempre quedarme en el club aunque en alg n momento me gustar a pasar a europa ahora mi cabeza est puesta en la primera fecha del
300833 theyre very similar the collingwood and hawthorn midfields in terms of tough hard bodies and weve got a lot of regard for the way the collingwood midfield go about it
300834 dane swan scott burns shane obree and those type of guys theyve just been stellar players for the pies and weve got similar guys like that ourselves with lewis and mitchell and brad sewell and those types of guys so we knew it would be a real battle in there
300835 i was pleased i reckon we might have just got the points in that midfield battle tonight it was so important being able to get the ball inside 50 to the tall targets up forward
300836 weve got a lot of guys who use the ball particularly well by hand sewell and mitchell and bateman and those types of guys
300837 sometimes it ends up being a volley of handballs and other times you just need to get it on your boot quickly
300838 so its not always pre designed that way but we know that if we move the ball quickly from the stoppage it gives us our best chance to score with open space in our forward line
300839 but its not always possible particularly against collingwood you dont usually generate that type of free ball on a regular basis against the pies
300840 civil claims at least give them another way to explore having their day in court or having someone listen to their story
300841 beyond reasonable doubt is a very high burden of proof for a crime where there is rarely a witness
300842 for people who cant let go and feel the need to do something this is a very good course of action
300843 we sat down in sydney drafted what we felt was the ideal football model and that was the first step as we got more funds and were financially more secure we would add to that and i suppose we sat down and changed gregs role a bit last year
300844 if you think back to when greg came we were trying to just plug holes all the time and we were not a very professionally run organisation in a lot of ways
300845 certainly if you look at it where hawthorn were sitting and their structure with chris pelchen and other people there managing it they were more advanced in terms of dealing with a young list than we were so yes we are playing catch up
300846 we would like to think if we get into the finals this year that would be great and our window would just start to open up if we dont make it this year it should start to open up next year but whether it is this year or next we know that we are close now and that when we do make the finals we should start to become a consistent finals side we dont want to be in for a year and down again
300847 it was clear to us that we needed the head of football to drive change not the board or the ceo and we felt the type of skills we needed in bringing best practices in sports science and elite conditioning and all of those different areas across different divisions needed to come from the head person and we didnt think greg was suitable for that role he is a good football person but not the man for that job
300848 the guy gave us six years and i felt he deserved a face to face for me to explain the reasons why i like greg and i respect him i thought he deserved that
300849 the reason we moved on it now was that we are well aware that there are other clubs in the marketplace and in the past richmond have lost a lot of opportunities to get good people
300850 if you look back greg actually did this with danny frawley he got him to announce it mid season that his contract would not be renewed when we knew rodney eade and wallace were in the marketplace so that we were first cabs off the rank
300851 now you look at where we are today and it is a bit hard to make a final call on that that assessment will come next year
300852 so any thought we will be reviewing terry at seasons end is categorically wrong
300853 the decision on greg was ratified at that board meeting but our review had been going for some time and the realisation we needed to change had been known for some time before tony even joined the board
300854 we think tony has got a really valuable contribution to make because he loves the club wants it to be successful and he knows football i dont think he has burnt his bridges at all with the board or the footy department
300855 now it is not only us catching up on the rest maybe for the first time we are going ahead
300856 its about attracting people to our football club if you are a young player in a year or two who decides he wants to come back to melbourne we are going to be a pretty attractive proposition state of the art facilities walking distance to the mcg inner city melbourne and a good young team and stable club like it was in the 70s when people wanted to come to richmond not just because gr graeme richmond was good at getting them here we have had to get that back because it hasnt been like that for a while
300857 id get it if i didnt have anything else to buy this month
300858 i would be disappointed if he leaves the club why should we let such a player go it is ridiculous to do that
300859 we know what is written in his contact with hamburg and we know all the figures and we cant be sure if hes going or not i think its better for him to stay in hamburg next season
300860 he has been here for three years now so that is very good and we are very grateful for that
300861 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
300862 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request
300863 we were destabilised by some clubs who did not respect the fair play rule in tapping up players
300864 i think we suffered from that at the end of the season we havent done that but that has been done to us
300865 i think it is a very fashionable thing to do these things when you start tapping up young players
300866 when they come from england and poach young players in spain it is something happening all the time in the world of football
300867 almost anything goes i dont know if we will be able to stop these things
300868 we are coming to tell the truth about chevrons desperate attempt to quash the legal claims of thousands of vulnerable people in the amazon rainforest who are struggling to survive due to oil contamination
300869 these people deserve their day in court without interference from chevron
300870 we are writing to seek your assurances that the u s trade representative will not allow negotiations over the andean free trade agreement to interfere with a case involving chevron that is under consideration by the ecuadorian judiciary particularly one involving environmental health and human rights issues that have regional importance while we are not prejudging the outcome of the case we do believe the 30 000 indigenous residents of ecuador deserve their day in court
300871 this season promises to be a real magnet for the spectators
300872 its possible that he radoi will leave in two or three days

300932 instead of a woman who can get a gun easier than a vegetable what about the black women who are using vegetables as guns in their commitment to change the way people of color eat what about the ones who bring ideas about natural foods homeopathy and spiritual balance to their families and communities the ones who design innovative strategies for addressing mental illness encourage healthy same sex eroticism and partnership and emphasize the need to define ourselves as global citizens what about the ones fighting environmental racism what about the black women who have such a deep concern about the fallacy of racial constructs they dont even identify as black
300933 i have observed for example that every photo of the historic civil rights marches demonstrations and rallies of the 1960s shows clear images of dr dorothy i height president of the national council of negro women dr c delores tucker president of the national political caucus of black women mrs coretta scott king president emerita of the martin luther king jr center for nonviolent social change and several other unnamed women they were photographed marching and standing right beside dr martin luther king jr the urban leagues whitney young the naacps roy wilkins and the congress on racial equalitys james farmer but national media did then and still do refer to the big four of the civil rights movement ignoring the ubiquitous black women leaders

301019 why do many koreans take criticism of korea so poorly
301020 yeah ive lived in sixteen different expat communities over the last thirty years and things are way worse here than anywhere else

301029 ive heard thats true it might be because he grew up eating with chopsticks studies have shown eating with chopsticks increase your iq
301030 ah that might partially explain why koreans scored higher than any other country on standardized iq tests
301031 indeed though i would credit that more to the fact koreans are extremely diligent students
301032 its because our young people are raised in such strong families confucianism values the family as the lynchpin of a healthy society

301037 post one of the must read posts and an article without which this post would probably not exist at all the comments on that post are also very interesting for numerous reasons
301038 it felt like my familys dirty laundry was being aired to stranger and strangers were now telling me how to fix my familys problems
301039 if i decide your complaints are borne of ignorance or culture shock i can dismiss them

301044 now add to this the fact because of our language limitations a lot of us cant access the korean language media in print or tv this means that while there might be a very lively discussion of koreas social ills in korean because the english media editors and producers diligently excise almost all such topics from the pages of the english dailies we have no idea whether social critics set the agenda in korean public discourse or whether koreans just sit in circles repeating to each other the same things they say to us when they meet us
301045 13 but youre telling this to the wrong crowd you should learn korean and say this to korean telling it to other expats is preaching to the converted and not very helpful the people who really need to hear culture changing ideas are the ones who cant read english who are captive to the korean language media answer you are absolutely right
301046 i wanted to see exotic korea the crown of east asia i wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture and argue with them

301085 this guy had all the incentive to take off knowing what he would face in prison so to know that there was nothing holding him here that his family wouldnt suffer one bit if he skipped town thats an enormous screwup

301145 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

301150 whos counting theres 95 days we need your help florida will be a battleground state so we are going to need all your help
301151 i couldnt even finish the sentence but i know how these things are
301152 everybody was saying how humble he is how personable he is and he made a very positive impression to everyone who was there
301153 many of his answers showed me that he was not in touch with his audience
301154 he did a good job of standing in there and taking the punches
301155 but i cant say i was satisfied with his answers
301156 i believe that if you have a major felony conviction whether its cocaine trafficking or mortgage fraud you should not be in a position of trust such as a mortgage broker would have with access to personal financial data and with opportunity to steal from people
301157 it seems me that there should be a period of time after which you come out of prison that youre not given the right to have a license in professions that have that type of quality
301158 what this investigation did to us good guys the white hat wearing brokers is that it devalued our license
301159 there needs to be an iron wall between the consumer and a felon in dealing with mortgages
301160 the debt for a persons wrongs can be paid in full people can be forgiven by their creator
301161 he arranged nearly 3 million in fraudulent loans and fleeced 30 people many of them elderly and disabled
301162 the key to this is proper hiring techniques and doing proper background investigations
301163 to me the focus should be on the people in charge
301164 in this case the focus does need to be on people who have been convicted of financial related crimes
301165 just like you dont want to give firearms authority back to someone who has committed armed robbery
301166 then we need to give people that second chance otherwise we might be forcing them back into a life of crime and thats not what we want to do we believe in rehabilitation
301167 if that means we purge all white collar criminals from our ranks great if it means removing all criminals thats probably better but what we have to have is swift action we have to reinstate trust in the profession
301168 i would generally support the attorney general on this for consumer protection
301169 but there may be unintended consequences its a bit of a broad brush there are many felonies that had nothing to do with fraud that give you no reason to think theyd be involved in mortgage fraud you might be preventing someone from rehabilitating themselves and getting their lives back on track a hot political topic reggie mitchell a lawyer with people for the american way blasted mccollum for using the mortgage crisis as a pretext for applying the brakes to civil rights restoration he saw this as an opening since its a hot political topic
301170 its an emotional appeal not a logical one we know that nationwide the majority of people that created the foreclosure crisis are not people previously convicted of a crime this is simply a drop in the bucket of the larger problem of foreclosures
301171 but i certainly would not have raised this but for the fact that it has direct bearing on the issue at hand im interested in the safety and security of the people of florida thats what they elected me to do i would be very remiss if i didnt do this
301172 it takes a highly sophisticated agency to produce anthrax in the lethal form not many parties can do that
301173 continues his part of the war in the form of terrorism it is unlikely that anthrax will remain in letters it is likely that it will be used in the subway of a city or in the ventilation system of a u s building saddam wants revenge against us he wants to do to the u s what weve done to iraq
301174 the south african media have been abuzz with details of that nations former biological warfare program and its links to the cia the south african bio chemical war program was code named project coast and was centered at the roodeplat research laboratories north of pretoria the lab maintained links to the us biowarfare facility at fort detrick and britains porton down laboratory the head of the south african program dr wouter basson was reportedly offered a job with the cia in the united states after the fall of the apartheid regime according to former south african national intelligence agency deputy director michael kennedy when basson refused the offer the cia allegedly threatened to kill him
301175 they were drinking buddies whod both been involved in anti terrorism efforts long before the world trade center crumbled now suddenly people were saying that hatfill could be responsible for the countrys first case of domestic bioterrorism a release of lethal anthrax through the mail that had left five people dead and 17 others infected in the fall of 2001
301176 where hed begun making a name for himself preaching the dangers of a bioterror attack soon they ran into each other again at charleys place in mclean then a favorite hangout for the u s intelligence community
301177 showed up there with men whom bedlington recognized as bodyguards for saudi arabian prince bandar bin sultan
301178 former cnn reporter who has known hatfill socially for six years said he and hatfill are part of a group of friends who visited a house in the virginia mountains near shenandoah national park in october for a weekend of skeet shooting and socializing
301179 inspired a mini industry of speculation that he may somehow be implicated in last falls deadly anthrax attacks
301180 the hunting of steven j hatfill why are so many people
301181 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
301182 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
301183 a large number of variations in the appearance of normal female genitalia
301184 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm

301192 i am in the process of building myself a website i am in sales and it is going to be part of my new self marketing campaign sales people would be interested in reading an article that may include some tips maybe what to do what not to do and tips to getting traffic to a newly created site
301193 i would welcome practical advice on how a small business could implement a marketing strategy that incorporates social networks and interactive online marketing the killer hook would be a framework in which you could calculate a reasonable expectation on roi

301196 i know you didnt include public relations in your list but id like to suggest it id like to see an article surveying how much pr consultants charge how their fees are broken down and what a typical pr proposal looks like i find that there are tons of books articles on how to write a press release etc but when it comes down to the nitty gritty how to info there isnt much out there good luck and let us know what you decided to write about
301197 i would be interested in new trends buzz words like
301198 all those topics are fantastic and i also love the idea of public relations an article featuring different social media tools and how effective they are for certain groups would be a nice read however in an easy to read format there were a slew of these articles a few months ago but with the advent of new tools twitter and all the mini tools that came afterwards for it for example its time for a new review of what is out there hope this helps
301199 what would be great rather than just looking at social media would be a focus on how to effectively use each tool and also how to actually judge results its easy to advocate facebook youtube et al but what methods are there for proving any of the benefits either that or seeing as there are so many many tech blogs out there take a personal look at tools for your role at an interactive marketer sound producer

301263 the comparatively large increase is consistent with some people electing to contract out meal preparation activity in response to their reduced availability of time from increased employment combined with their expanded spending capacity from higher real income

301270 comcasts interference is far more invasive and widespread than the company first conceded
301271 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
301272 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
301273 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
301274 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
301275 sen stevens has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
301276 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
301277 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
301278 were building this bridge quickly but were building it safely
301279 this is a bridge of its time and a bridge for the future
301280 theres a great sense of pride in whats being accomplished
301281 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
301282 i still dont go over the mississippi here in minnesota that i dont look down and remember and pray
301283 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
301284 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
301285 its going to be a celebration of life but i also think its going to be a remembrance of what people went through
301286 i think were going to get an opportunity to feel some of that
301287 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
301288 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
301289 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
301290 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
301291 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
301292 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
301293 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
301294 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
301295 pointing out your opponents worldwide celebrity is not the low road and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
301296 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
301297 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
301298 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
301299 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down
301300 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
301301 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
301302 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death we ask that the media respect the privacy of his family and allow them to grieve
301303 significant obligations to the victims of these attacks and their families that must be fulfilled before any additional information on the investigation can be made public in addition investigative documents remain under court seal
301304 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
301305 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
301306 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing
301307 i may not have spoken out the way you want me to speak out
301308 the only way to solve the problems in this country is if we all come together black and white
301309 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
301310 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
301311 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
301312 clearly 3 percent lower gasoline demand is going to have an effect on downstream numbers at least until we see a real meaningful correction in the feedstock costs
301313 the commodity price just overwhelms any weakness in any other areas
301314 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
301315 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
301316 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
301317 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
301318 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
301319 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
301320 we need to identify these people and weed them out
301321 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
301322 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
301323 now is the time to demand real new reform earned through discipline grinding work tough choices and leadership john mccain has dedicated his career in public service to the hard and sometimes unpopular work of achieving meaningful reform
301324 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
301325 i cant trust a thing they say so how do i choose a candidate
301326 oh his flip flopping on x yes that certainly is flip flopping
301327 well it was quite shocking i must say there was blood everywhere
301328 there was a stream of blood coming from his ear and another from his mouth
301329 of course there was a huge pool of blood on the floor and his clothes were splattered with it
301330 it felt as if no one in the elevator including me was breathing
301331 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
301332 it all sounds the same so i dont listen to it
301333 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
301334 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time

301340 isnt this so great i am hilariously cute which is in itself kind of hilariously cute dont you think
301341 hey when its on its side it kind of looks like a man masturbating
301342 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
301343 coach willingham tried to get me in but they didnt approve it
301344 the holdup was my grade point average it wasnt high enough with the score i got on the sat i needed to retake two classes online and get bs i finished the classes and still need to take the finals but i have bs for sure
301345 guess its a day late a dollar short as they say
301346 im qualified with those bs they told me what to do and i got it done but theyve talked about different options for me and i want to spend time with the team and stuff
301347 the ncaa allows that and that would be a great option so i can still bond with my teammates
301348 boyles is my boy and we talked about this its not the worst thing but im really bummed
301349 he was back home last week and we threw some balls and talked about it
301350 4blox has developed a unique software based approach to performance that sets it apart from current hardware based iscsi offload and acceleration products
301351 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
301352 i dont want to be bothered by this until the start date arrives
301353 it is pretty extraordinary footage and quite humbling but it is sort of very beautiful the response i suppose 35 years later to find that people are so fascinated by it and have so enjoyed it is slightly overwhelming and all the comments on the youtube site theyre so positive it is marvellous that so many people are getting so much enjoyment out of it
301354 hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me you notice that
301355 i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes going to do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things
301356 they know that youre not real happy with them and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
301357 what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
301358 weve seen these types of worms before typically around myspace
301359 people are more trusting of things they receive from a friend
301360 das ist ein hammer los der schwerstm gliche gegner f r uns aber ich bin mir sicher auch madrid h tte sich wen anders gew nscht dieses duell erwartest du eher im achtel oder viertelfinale die chancen stehen 50 50
301361 bei der auslosung h tte es f r uns besser laufen k nnen wir m ssen versuchen uns im heimspiel eine gute ausgangsposition zu verschaffen
301362 die aufgabe unserer scouts wird sein m glichst viele informationen ber den gegner zu sammeln
301363 sicherlich war es rgerlich dass wir uns nicht besser pr sentiert haben vor allem weil das spiel live im fernsehen bertragen wurde
301364 aber die hauptsache ist dass wir eine runde weiter sind
301365 der dritte platz den gy r in der vorsaison erreicht hat spricht f r die qualit t der mannschaft wir werden gy r beobachten lassen und uns videomaterial besorgen aber unser ziel kann es nur sein die n chste runde zu erreichen
301366 bei allem respekt m ssen wir uns durchsetzen und die erste hauptrunde im uefa cup erreichen
301367 es h tte f r uns sicherlich besser laufen k nnen atletico ist eine gute mannschaft die in der sehr starken spanischen liga im letzten jahr vierter geworden ist und ber starke spieler verf gt wir m ssen den gegner nun genau beobachten und versuchen uns im heimspiel eine gute ausgangsposition zu verschaffen
301368 die man sicher eher f rs achtel oder viertelfinale erwartet

301370 the people who lived through love canal need to know what their risks are and what they might expect for their children
301371 the state health department is proud of the work we have done on love canal over the years
301372 we have included experts on the studys advisory committee and community consultants who were former love canal residents we have issued newsletters on our progress met numerous times in open meetings and have strived to be straightforward and open
301373 i could probably drop a package of sweet n low and evacuate this building
301374 i want to look my fellow americans directly in the eye and declare to them i am not the anthrax killer
301375 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
301376 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
301377 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
301378 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today

301389 how many of you remember the boston tea party this is the boston tea party
301390 the more time congress spends in washington the heavier our chains and the lighter our wallets get
301391 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues and opposes increasing the size scope and power of government at any level for any purpose
301392 but the next time they walk it will be the first in living memory they wouldnt know smaller government if it walked up behind them and hit them in the pants with a bass fiddle
301393 if congressman shadegg wants to be a member of our party he can start being more pro freedom and register at the web site like everyone else

301433 im not good at dealing with emotion im too empathetic thats both a help and a hindrance when youre there to make a judicial finding you should be able to make it without having to blow your nose
301434 i have never regretted the role or what i have heard seen or felt but each time i walked away from the courthouse i have had to leave the emotions in the courtroom
301435 that would have been the most difficult because even today there has never been any trace of the boat or the two men for their families that unknown must be so hard and all i had to go by were some possibilities raised from the investigation i could not give those families any answers i guess there is never real closure in a case like that
301436 there was leeanne rimene and that beautiful little boy te reo who died in 2006 i looked at her partner who was still feeling so confused and hurting and i felt for them no one could have prevented their deaths but it is not easy
301437 we had some really good talks with seattle they were pretty intense and pretty in depth blue jays gm j
301438 we thought at one point there was a possibility to get something done there but it just didnt come to fruition

301447 the swells got to about 7m and the captain turned the ship so we were going with the swell rather than against it the captain then told us we were going to turn to get back on to a safer course and it was in that manoeuvre that we hit two waves at once
301448 unfortunately it was enough to smash crockery and send tables flying some people were injured but some just panicked i think it was more a mental thing
301449 there were people with some more serious injuries needing medical assistance but i dont know the details
301450 some people were freaking out but all the crew were saying was to go down below to our cabins because there would be less rocking and so people who needed treatment got it quickly
301451 i felt sorry for the crew they fed everyone made sure we were all okay and they were happy the whole time they really stepped up it probably increased my respect for them
301452 the first four weeks in hospital i didnt want to look in the mirror at photos nothing but then i finally popped a brave pill
301453 i couldnt do much at all dianne was my full time nurse at home i couldnt even go to the toilet on my own
301454 you use your hands with everything you do even just moving round in bed mine were all strapped up with splints so i had to use my elbows a lot to shift around
301455 theyve been bloody good when i was first out of hospital there was a truck here every day coming to see me and asking if there was anything they could do to help
301456 the turnout was absolutely bloody amazing even the guard of honour from police lined up from the countdown corner right down to victoria st there would have been a 100 or so
301457 once a firefighter always a firefighter and i guess the fact i dont remember the two vital hours i dont remember the fire or explosion i last remember standing beside the truck and then the doctor telling me he was going to put some staples in my head
301458 it will be interesting to see what does come out of it the only thing i would like to see is that it doesnt happen again thats the most important thing
301459 ive seen him three or four times hes doing extremely well and as far as i know theyre very happy with the way hes going
301460 i thought it was pretty neat especially since she arrived in a fire engine they drove her from the hamilton central fire station to the casino
301461 my parents raised me right but i yielded to sin started lying cheating and stealing then came the drugs
301462 i thank god i got time with my son and know ill be with him again this i know
301463 the only problem weve really had was a little issue with the union on the block layers other than that very little problems with the school
301464 they are going to make some new friends and all that stuff
301465 its coming together like its suppose to we should be done by august 15th which was the plan date
301466 ich hab das tool gefunden bin jetzt weiter crysis ds spielen
301467 military force must only be used to defend oneself or ones unit shooting unarmed civilians is in violation of every international law and also runs counter to humanitarianism

301473 there were about 40 people lined up to speak and democrats adjourned to keep us from doing the special orders
301474 i was looking around and trying to figure out what we were going to do and just decided to go down to the well and started talking to the people in the galleries

301481 discovery could yield new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases study says
301482 the purpose of mr dions carbon tax is to raise money for the federal government so that he can spend it
301483 that is the only reason a politician ever puts in a new tax and whenever a politician puts in a new tax he says either its temporary or its revenue neutral this tax will be neither temporary nor revenue neutral no other tax has ever been
301484 if you want industry to reduce emissions you ask industry to reduce emissions if what you really want is money for the government you impose a tax and thats why mr dion is doing it
301485 an example of how advertising and lobbying groups censor american news
301486 i think its a cynical attempt to play to the nationalists in quebec by using the word autonomous without actually doing anything
301487 france and quebec have been working on this credentials arrangement and quebec already has autonomy in that area of immigration so its nothing to do with ottawa
301488 seems to be trying to take some credit for it as if it is something novel or something that we should be grateful to ottawa for
301489 yes of course quebec has a particular status within the federation for instance the quebec seat at unesco why not
301490 but to negotiate international treaties one on one with other nations goes beyond quebec having a seat at the international table
301491 sorry your condition is too advanced for us we really only do injections go find another pain doc

301495 i do not believe there is anyone who does not know that i am in the detention unit
301496 i must say that this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
301497 the man is standing trial for war crimes he has an opportunity to defend himself in the hague that is not an opportunity that was afforded to any of his victims
301498 those are lies i do not comment on any longer
301499 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
301500 will insist on that even if he has to go on hunger strike
301501 i am not interested in having someone else read the indictment to me
301502 i would rather receive the new indictment that has been announced and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
301503 its the beast i did not believe it until now
301504 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
301505 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
301506 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats
301507 the informant det const chambers learned from interviewing the victim that the reason for the assault was that one of the accused girls and the victim had both been dating the same boy and that the victim felt the girl was jealous of her
301508 the informant noted that the complainants hair seemed to be cut unevenly to her ear as if it had been chopped off
301509 the complainant told the informant that her hair had been below shoulder length prior to the assault
301510 the informant can state that she personally viewed swelling to the victims left side of her face as well as several blister marks on her arms that appear to have been caused by cigarette burns small circular burn pattern
301511 troubled boy had tried to evade police and was high on drugs at the time
301512 a scale from one to ten id rate this as a beating around an eight thats how bad she was looking
301513 nothing it was just like cutting beef but for the bleeding
301514 i took them to send to a brazilian in england who she stole money from he said he was going to kill her
301515 a new law is being passed next year to enable tonga to make the next step in its democratic transition which is a wonderful thing for the pacific
301516 there are some tourist areas that are four to five miles away from the fire but we dont think they are in danger
301517 the starting point of the fire was near a stream which tourists use for rafting
301518 this is one of the biggest fires in antalyas history in terms of area affected and the biggest area in terms of damage it has caused
301519 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
301520 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
301521 the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
301522 its become even easier to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven
301523 we are nearly on our side if we get out of this it will be a miracle
301524 you have two games against benin and niger and if you win the two games you are the king of uganda
301525 i left a very good base there and maybe i can make a scottish manager happy i have spoken with bobby williamson and i wish for him to go and take the job over
301526 this is important to note because despite hosting the olympic games china has been undeterred in undertaking massive housing rights violations and promises to continue along this path once the games are over
301527 the olympic games is a huge event for china but its significance should not be exaggerated the extent of globalisation has already been felt in china so a single event like the games although significant will not bring revolution or change the way the country is governed
301528 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
301529 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
301530 the risk is that once they open up the country to thousands of journalists they will find a side of china the government does not want them to see or show the world
301531 china has never been indifferent to the rest of the world and has been poised to westernise before
301532 but it has lost interest drawn back or succumbed to internal stresses
301533 its record of relations with the wider world as opposed to relations with its immediate neighbours has been exemplary we should be vigilant patient not panicky
301534 there is a story i like to tell about a journalist working in china who had his mother visit

301542 i was running out there with my head cut off
301543 he got thrown in there with the sharks and he didnt drown
301544 he didnt get eaten at all he did a pretty good job of playing last year this year he has a training camp under his belt and a little consistency so its going to be good for him
301545 hes a rookie right now to this training camp thing
301546 hes hitting a little wall its to be expected since its his first one hes a pro hes competitive hes going to be ok
301547 i feel like a fifth year player from what i experienced last year
301548 i was going against randy moss and chad johnson and a couple of those great receivers
301549 i think the coaches did a great job of just giving me the basic things to do on defense
301550 now you look at it and youre like dang i did this or did that they just said it was ok and just be patient
301551 ill just say i did personal stuff i work hard at what i do
301552 im definitely smarter im just a student of the game im getting more wisdom in my brain and listening to coach and taking heed of it
301553 you never know what youre going to get from your freshman year to your sophomore year especially if a guy has got a ton of success
301554 and darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see
301555 i understand the defensive schemes more and i understand what im supposed to do at certain times
301556 last year i knew a couple of plays in the playbook and now its being smarter and learning the whole defense
301557 thats an area that weve got to keep developing with him
301558 it would be id say more of a substitution type role or a specialty role as opposed to being the primary guy back there
301559 lockdown corner thats a big phrase and a phrase where you shut it down
301560 you shut everything down if youre watching the best receiver on somebodys team you limit him to catches and you just shut him down
301561 the price of diesel has shot a huge hole in metros budget
301562 we are 22 million worse off than we thought we were going to be just because of the price of diesel
301563 we are not going to solve our problem through the fare box alone
301564 its going to be up to the legislature and the citizens
301565 you have an 85 percent chance of being diagnosed and your odds arent very good
301566 weve been trained to be in tune with bodies so when i felt a lump i panicked
301567 its a struggle between paying your mortgage or buying prescription for your daughter
301568 if it werent for my sisters i wouldnt have anyone to talk to
301569 my dad always told us god gives you as much as you can handle
301570 they wont publicly say it the mets dont do that they dont publicly do anything
301571 so they wont publicly say anything but i will say this there was no communication between willie and delgado
301572 and at times i think that by willies lets say silence over the inability for delgado to get hot kind of rang true spoke very loudly right
301573 you know what happened it hurt delgados feelings and he came out firing
301574 whatever happened somehow he lost the clubhouse and that message from rick and from willie became old
301575 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
301576 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
301577 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
301578 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
301579 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
301580 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
301581 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
301582 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
301583 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
301584 they dont make too many mistakes theyve got guys at the top of the lineup that can just drive you crazy then youve got some boppers three three run home runs you dont see that too often
301585 and we know we have to play at a very high level to beat them
301586 everyone is familiar with their positions so they are comfortable and can play faster
301587 he was bad but at least he was better than he was those last two first practices
301588 was he all right with the decision hes got no choice
301589 its tough i want to be out there every fifth day it doesnt matter if i pitch three innings and get shelled or go seven innings and do well i just want to be out there because thats how i am
301590 with the off days and them really not needing me right now it made sense to do it right now
301591 thats the best thing it would be better than me going out there at less than 100 percent and hurting the team
301592 the more rest the better hell be hell throw two bullpen sessions in the meantime he should be fine after that
301593 its a little later than i wanted to be back but you gotta take their schedule and do what they want
301594 the chances of getting him back on september 1st is zero
301595 as long as hes healthy well throw him out there
301596 he was a big part of our bullpen before that dreaded day in chicago
301597 i struggled a bit with being in the minor leagues
301598 mentally struggled when you have an ultimate goal of here and youre down there it draws on you
301599 i was throwing mid 90s playing in front of thousands of fans taking long bus trips its hard to throw 97 in that situation
301600 i want to see him in this setting instead of pitching down there
301601 sometimes the setting here is a bit different and i want to see if we can get him back to where he was
301602 he got thrown in there with the sharks and he didnt drown
301603 he didnt get eaten at all he did a pretty good job of playing last year this year he has a training camp under his belt and a little consistency so its going to be good for him
301604 hes a rookie right now to this training camp thing
301605 hes hitting a little wall its to be expected since its his first one hes a pro hes competitive hes going to be ok
301606 i feel like a fifth year player from what i experienced last year
301607 i was going against chad johnson and a couple of those great receivers

301611 you never know what youre going to get from your freshman year to your sophomore year especially if a guy has got a ton of success

301618 you shut everything down if youre watching the best receiver on somebodys team you limit him to catches and you just shut him down
301619 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken

301633 the challenge facing the telecommunications and broadcasting industry is that the services it can provide change so fast technologically that regulation is unable to keep up with technological developments this holds back economic growth
301634 many african countries have identified the telecommunications and broadcasting sector as vital to economic growth and have adopted the international best practice of technology neutral regulation thereby attracting investment flows ahead of their neighbours
301635 south africa could learn a lesson from some african countries that have liberalised their regulations

301833 i do not intend to involve myself in any debate whether magic in any sense is real or really possible in the world but i suppose that for the purposes of the tale some would say that there is a latent distinction such as once was called the distinction betewen magia and goeteia sorcery neither is in this tale good or bad per se but only by motive or purpose of use both sides use both but with different motives the supremely bad motive is for this tale since it is specially about it domination of other free wills the enemys operations are by no means all goetic deceits but magic that produces real effects in the physical world but his magia he uses to bulldoze both people and things and his goeteia to terrify and subjugate their magia the elves and gandalf use sparingly a magia prudcing real results like fire in a wet for specific beneficent purposes their goetic effects are entirely artistic and not intended to deceive they never deceive elves but may deceive or bewilder unaware men since the difference is to them as clear as the difference to us between fiction painting and sculpture and life both sides live mainly by ordinary means the enemy or those who have become like him go in for machinery with destructive and evil effects because magicians who have become chiefly concerned to use magia for their own power would do so do do so the basic motive for magia quite apart from any philosophic consideration of how it would work is immediacy speed reduction of labour and reduction also to a minimum or vanishing point of the gap between the idea or desire and the result or effect but the magia may not be easy to come by and at any rate if you have command of abundant slave labour or machinery often only the same thing concealed it may be as quick or quick enough to push mountains over wreck forests or build pyramids by such means anyway a difference in the use of magic in this story is that it is not to be come by by lore or spells but in an inherent power not possessed or attainable by men as such aragorns healing might be regarded as magical or at least a blend of magic with pharmacy and hypnotic processes but it is in theory reported by hobbits who have very little notions of philosophy and science while a is not a pure man but at long remove one of the children of luthien
301834 the particular branch of the high elves concerned the noldor or loremasters were always on the side of science and technology as we should call it they wanted to have the knowledge that sauron genuinely had

301851 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
301852 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
301853 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq

301865 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results

301872 antimicrobial resistance among these foodborne bacteria is not uncommon and often associated with the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals
301873 the single most important national security threat we face is the threat of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists what i did was reach out to senator dick lugar republican to help lock down loose nuclear weapons
301874 on the foreign relations committee obama passed a law to keep nuclear weapons out of terrorists hands
301875 introducing legislation today at the request of the executive branch and will be seeking unanimous consent to request its passage as soon as possible
301876 i was particularly pleased that barack chose nunn lugar law for threat reduction sponsored by sam nunn and lugar as the subject of his first foreign travel as a senator
301877 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
301878 lane kiffin has been mildly critical of walker since the offseason it does not seem like walker has taken off in oakland
301879 by next year at this time we may be saying rush who
301880 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible
301881 his favorite technique for discrediting an idea with which he disagrees is to make petty personal attacks against the people who espouse that idea
301882 he is not a nice man and he doesnt pretend to be and hes nasty
301883 limbaugh reminds us of morton downey jr the celebrated tv hatemonger of a few years ago
301884 the black illegitimacy rate is raised the rev jackson and other black leaders immediately change the subject
301885 for years jesse jackson and others have decried children having children
301886 remember how much you love rush limbaugh mother and think of all the terrible things theyve said about him notice how no one ever criticizes rich lowry you
301887 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
301888 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
301889 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
301890 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
301891 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
301892 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
301893 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
301894 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us
301895 it would be moronic to bring jim bates and his sorry defensive scheme back to denver
301896 you are a moron for wanting to bring jim bates and his sorry defensive scheme back to denver
301897 i think it takes a heartless sob not to make the rich pay their fair share of taxes
301898 dreadnought you are a heartless sob not to want to make the rich pay their fair share of taxes
301899 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
301900 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
301901 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
301902 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
301903 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
301904 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
301905 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
301906 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
301907 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
301908 we hadden al een tijdje plannen maar alles is nu in een stroomversnelling gekomen
301909 we werken reeds lange tijd aan de uitbouw van een dsl netwerk binnen verschillende belgische regios de overname van het klantenbestand en de technologie van e leven is voor ons de perfecte aanleiding om ons dsl product te lanceren
301910 louvain la neuve leuven en gent zullen hoofdzakelijk door free belgian network bediend worden
301911 these first couple of days are used to establish our expectations and establish how we practice
301912 were really devoted to the fundamentals of each position right now its important that each day we continue to progress especially when were out here in just helmets
301913 i thought our effort was good and i thought our focus was good
301914 the older kids have done a great job of leading our younger kids and teaching them the expectations we have on the practice field with all the freshmen we have one third of our team is new this year so there is going to be a lot of teaching on the field
301915 were number one how can we possibly lose unless we quit or those fill in your civilian quislings of choice stab us in the back
301916 william j astore a retired lieutenant colonel usaf taught at the air force academy and the naval postgraduate school
301917 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
301918 trickle down hell yeah that sounds great id like a trickle from your fountain of wealth just as long as i can keep my guns and that lady over there cant get an abortion its a deal
301919 another reason people vote republican is because they just arent as stupid as you liberals think they are
301920 not one thing yip says in his rant is true
301921 class talks about the kkk but yet there is an active kkk member in the us senate and hes a liberal democrat robert byrd
301922 sorry your democrat scare tactics dont work anymore people have gotten smarter
301923 they see how the dems in congress dont give a damn about people all they want to do is line their own pockets like democrat sen dianne feinstein
301924 and algore getting rich off the global warming scandal while he uses enough electricity to power hundreds of homes
301925 meanwhile the democrat lead congress approval rating is the lowest in american history single digits 9
301926 you guys may be like minded but there are far more people out there who think like i do and agree with me than whack job libs like you jeeniuses
301927 this month voters trust democrats more than republicans on seven out of ten electoral issues tracked rasmussen reports the republicans have managed to gain back some lost ground on national security and the war in iraq last month the democrats had the advantage on all ten key issues
301928 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
301929 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
301930 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
301931 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
301932 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
301933 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
301934 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here
301935 im shutting u down if u dont stop im calling the cops
301936 he has always had trouble dealing with women as equals
301937 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollup you cunt
301938 why is chelsea clinton so ugly the joke was ill received on many levels for its offense to the attorney general for its offense to the president and his wife
301939 the french remind me a little bit of an aging actress of the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but doesnt have the face for it
301940 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
301941 as long as its inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it
301942 and i stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago
301943 distasteful bit of dc yuckery so commonly quoted its hackneyed
301944 the new iq is a sophisticated car representing the ultimate refined urban mode of transportation it is designed to cater for the needs of buyers who seek more than just urban mobility but demand space and refinement in an environmentally friendly vehicle
301945 like it or not one of the most important features of any microsoft office alternative is being able to read microsoft office files tux comes to felton california
301946 its one thing to to change someone over from windows to linux
301947 ease the pain of migrating device control applications from microsoft windows to linux by understanding how device control works in making desktop linux work for business
301948 theres no doubt that i played into the image that was portrayed in the press portrayed in peoples description of why they liked metallica
301949 i didnt want to disappoint i wanted to be that guy i wanted to put that mask on and then keeping the mask on 24 hours became suffocating and i could not do it anymore
301950 now lets get one thing straight before i start im not one to boast but i usually have very hard marathon like erections
301951 i dont think its necessary people come to have fun and i dont see where theres all that much trouble to do something like that
301952 i think its a great idea i like the idea that they stay within the tent and theyre not out walking around with it yeah i think its a good idea
301953 we have a lot of kids that can achieve seventies and not come to school more than half the time so what were looking for is a more holistic way of measuring effectiveness and a more holistic way of measuring students aptitude and ability to be able to compete and be involved
301954 ive got two big air canisters with me because i dont want a repeat of my
301955 it sure is but i was riding my bike long before gas went to four dollars a gallon
301956 i liked so and so band before they became popular

301964 dif cil falar ele um bom atacante mas j n o aquele edmundo de antes da poca do palmeiras acho que j n o causa tanto medo para a gente
301965 ele um grande jogador e acho que faz falta para o vasco n o posso dizer que vai facilitar nosso trabalho porque vai ter um outro profissional l que pelo menos faz uma correria o edmundo um jogador experiente e vai fazer falta
301966 sei que a culpa quando o time perde sempre do treinador sei que vivemos um momento infeliz mas tudo passa n o qualquer treinador que perde sessenta por cento da sua for a e consegue os resultados
301967 n s estamos remontando um time dentro de um campeonato e isso bastante complicado nossa equipe era boa porque al m da qualidade dos jogadores havia entrosamento entre eles precisamos ter tranq ilidade para lidar com essa situa o
301968 o que mais cobro para a equipe saber trabalhar sob press o e que tenha maturidade para atuar e assim poder trabalhar e reverter essa situa o em dois jogos fora de casa

301975 there are obvious differences between species but its obvious that these chimps are suffering chronically
301976 the patterns of behaviour we are seeing in these chimps are not normal and not seen in the wild
301977 i believe unfortunately rhoda mcfarland was in the wrong place at the wrong time
301978 i dont believe that any church squabble could have led to anything like this
301979 one day she called me and asked me to move her stuff out of the church
301980 i spoke to her one time i invited her to come back to the church to pray for her and bless her and have her leave with peace and not anger out the back door
301981 something was happening inside the church that she didnt approve of and she wanted to leave
301982 weve talked to detectives offered to let them look at our books and they declined
301983 hes bernie hes one of the best guys youll meet

301985 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw

301994 separate and other not having any aims or values in common with other cultures
301995 hostility towards islam used to justify discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society
301996 the message that i thought was delivered to us was that they do not want him associated with muslims or muslim supporters
301997 discriminatory practices towards muslims and exclusion of muslims from mainstream society
301998 i guess green is the hamas color but its also the color of islam thats one way for the obama campaign to alienate 1 4 billion muslims worldwide
301999 muslim lawmaker confronted obama behind closed doors on head scarf gaffe
302000 the idea is to show our deep roots from many cultures in gaza
302001 its important that people realise we had a good civilization in the past israel has legitimacy from its history we do too
302002 there was the siege of alexander the great and of the persians and of the british at the end of the day this siege will be a footnote
302003 people here dont hear this word i want it to enter the vocabulary
302004 after we have a qualified government and the capability to protect the heritage of gaza
302005 she did us a favour because it would all be gone or destroyed today
302006 i see no reason we couldnt arrange a long term loan
302007 there is the perversity that gazans today cannot see their own heritage in our museum
302008 prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products and imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran
302009 no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against iran
302010 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
302011 oh my god ive been sexually harrassing people left and right without knowing it

302023 we are interested in the nature and extent to which you engage in such practices and the impact it could have on consumer privacy
302024 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
302025 obama understands that the future of our economy depends to a large extent on how we can ensure that americans have access to technology and we empower americans to use it
302026 the reality is that if we rely simply on the free market there will be many people in this country that will have to do without this is fundamentally about economic development its about making sure that people in rural areas can participate in the information age
302027 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
302028 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
302029 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
302030 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
302031 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
302032 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
302033 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
302034 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
302035 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
302036 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
302037 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
302038 obama has said further drilling would not relieve americans from record high gas prices or help cut down on our appetite for foreign oil
302039 its really misleading to hold that out as a panacea it wont work it might work for our grandchildren

302041 p remature babies babies born too soon and too small accounted for a growing proportion of infant deaths when linked with previous studies that have shown that abortion increases a womans chance of having a baby prematurely the conclusion is that women who have had abortions are more likely to bear children who die as infants or suffer from severe health issues
302042 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children

302046 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one
302047 a light will shine down from somewhere it will light upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
302048 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
302049 barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jump start our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
302050 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
302051 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power

302060 on the day of his appointment he mad sure to be at the doctors as soon as the office opened

302062 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
302063 obviously the first super bowl we won he was a big part of that like i said hes a guy we never had to worry about making a play you dont say that very often in the national football league especially at that left tackle position i gave an illustration of this one where his shoulders popped and he refused to come out until john elway did that gives you an idea of how tough he was as well we will be down there in canton ohio with about nine or 10 coaches that were with gary we are looking forward to it
302064 when his weight does go down to the weight that we wanted then hell be out there practicing
302065 not much experience there but playing very well im hoping we have one of the better offensive lines weve had in a long time
302066 tom is such a tough guy when hes feels like hes ready to go hell go
302067 when that will be i really dont know hes smart when you get older you understand what you can do and what you cant do so when he can play hell be back in the lineup
302068 not only was he a veteran player but we thought he was kind of the nuts and bolts of the offensive line at kansas city all these years i dont how many snaps he made in a row having him on our football team and playing the way he has is a plus for us
302069 what we are trying to do is get better every day as a team and focus on the now
302070 dont worry about what happened in the past and just worry about whats happening in the future if guys go out there with that mindset then you have a chance to play a little football
302071 its a pretty significant change its similar to the college rule
302072 it makes it easier on us as officials because its just a simple two feet down and not have to worry about anything else because it takes the judgement out of it i think its better for everybody
302073 theyll designate that by number and player at the beginning of the game
302074 theyll usually have green dots on the backs of their helmets so well look around for that
302075 well design and manufacture our own super cool net devices

302077 the hotel has been associated with radisson since 1982 he said
302078 it is extensive renovation anyone entering the hotel will see dramatic differences
302079 this should position us to build some excellent groundwork to attract new conventions to the lexington center
302080 were across the board in academics administration athletics and all our different departments
302081 governor collins has certainly been a vital asset to georgetown college and that will continue
302082 we do expect that shell take on some responsibilities beyond what she has been doing
302083 the situation simply is that like a lot of businesses and non profit organizations this economic downturn has had an impact on us
302084 we had an extremely high number of gifts going into our operating budget

302099 games which were invented years ago like space invaders donkey kong super mario and pac man all appear in the top ten
302100 this shows that classic games will live on forever in the hearts of computer game fans
302101 the gaming industry is getting more and more competitive releasing more and more innovative games by the minute but this survey proves that sometimes the most simple formats work well to keep game players hooked
302102 you can get out of the train or get out of the way were all just raisin mccain

302105 a service for friends family and co workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question
302106 the attorney generals suggestion that the rcmp fill in as temps to address sheriff staff shortages is false economics
302107 its robbing peter to pay paul and simply doesnt address the real issue which is the recruitment and retention of b c sheriffs to ensure the secure operation our court system
302108 weve shown government the wage spreads showing differences of up to 10 27 an hour between sheriffs and those in the greater vancouver transit police and vancouver city police
302109 the government wont move and the result is that the people they need choose to work elsewhere
302110 in 2007 b c sheriff services hired 19 fewer sheriffs than they lost
302111 in 2008 13 members have been hired but weve lost 23 members already and 2 more are confirmed to leave in august thats a net loss of 12 more sheriffs this year
302112 the situation in b c courts is unacceptable and is entirely due to his governments refusal to recognize the market value of the services our sheriffs provide
302113 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
302114 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
302115 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
302116 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
302117 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
302118 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
302119 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
302120 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
302121 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
302122 the views expressed above are those of the poster and not those of multiplay uk

302130 the council recognizes that pipso is at a pivotal point in its development
302131 over the past three years we have shown that we have the capability to engage our private sector members with governments and this has begun to attract donors who seek an effective mechanism in the region to support closer dialogue between the government and the business community as the basis to ensure better policies that can really drive economic growth and stability in the region
302132 amongst our top priorities over the next six months will be to engage in visits and surveys of the national members of pipso to seek their guidance on the specific needs and priorities that pipso should assist them with and then to get stuck in to do something about those
302133 our death rate from cancers is related to late stages of presentation and often limited intervention options on treatment

302137 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura while it is too early to start testing young women with migraine with aura for this gene variant more focused research will help us to understand these complex links and will help us to potentially develop preventative strategies
302138 doctors should try to reduce heart disease risk factors and advise young women who experience migraine with aura not to smoke and to consider birth control pill alternatives as these increase the risk of ischemic vascular problems
302139 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
302140 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
302141 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
302142 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
302143 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
302144 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
302145 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed
302146 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior
302147 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
302148 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals
302149 big is gt mate or a meal familiarity decides if wolf spider loves em or eats em
302150 these findings suggest that some of the memory impairment experienced during aging could involve a reduction in the automatic process of experience replay
302151 this is the first study to suggest that an animals ability to perform a spatial memory task may be related to the brains ability to perform memory consolidation during sleep
302152 this studys findings could inspire the development and testing of pharmacological agents designed to enhance memory replay phenomena
302153 to the best of our knowledge this is the first molecular epidemiological study to evaluate mtdna content in lymphocytes as a susceptibility biomarker for cancer
302154 complex climate models are tools that provide insights and knowledge into how future climate may evolve to assure that future climate projections are used appropriately it is crucial to understand what current models can simulate well and where models need improvements
302155 this report makes an important contribution in helping to describe and explain the current state of high end climate modeling for the non specialist
302156 the science of climate modeling has matured through finer spatial resolution the inclusion of a greater number of physical processes and through comparison to a rapidly expanding array of observations
302157 an average over the set of models clearly provides climate simulation superior to any individual model
302158 no current model is superior to others in all respects but rather different models have differing strengths and weaknesses

302176 as you know shia was involved in a traffic collision last sunday he and his passenger were struck by another vehicle as shia was completing a left turn the force of that impact immediately flipped shias vehicle over and as a result shias left hand was crushed we have continued to cooperate with the police and the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck our independent investigation of the accident is ongoing but we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident shia and his family are very thankful for the efforts of medical personnel at the scene and for all the care and understanding that we have received at shia underwent four hours of surgery on sunday and has been recovering since then his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications shias left arm remains fully immobilized from the elbow down and he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work we are hopeful that this return will be sooner rather than later and the transformers 2 production company has rearranged their shooting schedule to accommodate this injury we remain very grateful for their understanding we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision we would encourage anyone who has information to contact mr norris office at the telephone number listed below so that our investigators may follow up

302178 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
302179 despite insistence from u s military commanders who recommend quality of life improvements to undercut militants and win over sunni districts wary of the shiite led government
302180 up to now we have seen nothing from the government

302185 i would describe my dad in all seriousness as spock from
302186 so i would ask him and he would say well you know it was nominal nasa speak for as expected i think in many ways he thought it would be bragging or just that it made him uncomfortable to seem excited
302187 i get criticised even though im spending my own money people will always say there are far better things to spend it on but to go over the next horizon is the only way mankind has found the things it has
302188 even at 6 to 7g in effect when you have six to seven times your own weight lying on top of your chest breathing becomes a problem
302189 i wanted him to receive the same warmth everywhere its not easy to go from one gastronomic table to another alone and without someone to share your enthusiasm
302190 he came into the kitchen for a discussion with the team
302191 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
302192 were not going to allow anyone to define john mccain on these terms
302193 i dont think the campaign is negative in the slightest
302194 hes not from central casting when it comes to presidents of the united states hes young hes new to washington yes hes african american
302195 i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street

302205 besides there are already privacy laws in la big ones you cant photograph people on private property for example al pacino robert de niro jack nicholson you never see paparazzi pictures of these people guess why because theyre not stumbling out of a nightclub at 2am without their boxer shorts on
302206 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations to deal with photographers

302232 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
302233 with regard to misdemeanor versus felony i thought that there should be a punitive element that would involve some jail time
302234 a felonys very important obviously if a felon cant possess a firearm we have concerns about firearms in this case that is the reason we would like a felony conviction at the end of the day we really need to scrutinize the evidence and ask ourselves if we think we can meet our burden in this case as we said there were two people in this room one doesnt have a memory and the other one as is his right is not talking
302235 as far as we knew he was just a normal guy a real friendly guy
302236 ive got to admit its a tad chilling when you see your name on something like this letter

302239 basically this will be on the wall of your house and it will tell you what you are paying for the cost of a kwh at a point in time
302240 it empowers customers to see the real costs of what they are doing and make better decisions
302241 it will improve our billing capability accuracy it will help us be more efficient in terms of shut offs and reconnections
302242 the peak power is often carbon based which is all adding to global warming pollution so this effort is a significant move forward in reducing global warming pollution
302243 i think it sounds like a good idea that might save pennies without us being able to read it and see what were using when were using it you cant tell
302244 were going to follow every procedure and process to assure the safety of the school prior to school opening
302245 both the principal and administrative assistant did see them wetting the tile but when the inspector visited the top floor he didnt see any evidence of water bottles or anything like that
302246 the risk is minimal because the amount of exposure is minimal one time exposure will likely not create any problems for people who encountered it but theres not way to know for certain

302301 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
302302 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
302303 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
302304 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

302399 source port randomization to improve resilience against dns cache poisoning attacks
302400 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the internet protocol weakness
302401 we know with microsoft that there were a few problems even installing their dns patch
302402 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
302403 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
302404 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already

302441 we have to take a look at the legacy how can we improve the standards of the existing stock
302442 buildings get retrofitted all the time anyway its establishing a plan for where you are to where you want to be
302443 if the tenants are asking do you have a plan to get leed existing building that will be a major incentive
302444 the marketplace will drive it the minute you lose a tenant it will become important to you whether you want to or not youre going to have to do it to be competitive
302445 i think its fair to say that given the size and breadth of our real estate holdings were focused on this as an important initiative and will roll it out in the near future
302446 when we signed on they were looking for small family run individual type artisan shops and were very aware that being small companies and family run we werent high end people there was not big money coming in
302447 for us weve been doing farmers markets 25 years and the idea of a seven day a week shop was a jump
302448 we felt that was fair but we couldnt do 50 percent more which is what im hearing is happening
302449 if youre talking about westfield san francisco centre its a huge mall with national retailers with huge businesses outside the mall and who can pay huge rents because they need to be seen there
302450 in a place like the ferry building you cant treat small retailers the same way in our case this is our only income we dont have another store
302451 i want them to keep most of the tenants they are good tenants
302452 its a unique group of people they brought in and now that its all good everybody wants that space
302453 when you consider that the ferry building has now been open for five years and weve essentially lost one tenant because he is no longer in the business i would say its quite a success and quite consistent
302454 weve known these people from the beginning and are working through all leases with them and the renewals quite well
302455 it was clear they were trying to make their numbers and we were trying to make ours
302456 what do tenants expect this is the hottest property in town equity office is going to want its money
302457 its been a problem from the beginning half the companies here are boutiques and this is a showcase and the rest of us are small companies that have to work really hard to make this work its hard to remember in the ferry building that these people are basically blue collar workers

302463 a lot of veterans when they come home find the transition difficult and we all turn to different things to get through those times
302464 if were not lucky enough to have a strong family social network to hold us together in those difficult times people turn to drugs turn to alcohol

302472 he was tremendous the entire week he worked hard is a very humble young man he really fit in with his teammates out here and made a great impression on everyone as a player and as a person
302473 riku did a very nice job its a long process with the goaltenders but in our opinion rikus right on track for eventually becoming a starter in the national hockey league the important thing is that he continues to stay focused and build his game
302474 tys been a terrific surprise hes got such good size and mobility with strong stick and puck skills hes a lot further along than we thought when we made the trade for him
302475 fadden and killorn both played very well this week killorns going to harvard and we expect big things from him down the road fadden were excited to see in traverse city at the prospects tournament and well see how his development continues
302476 defenseman darryl boyle i thought he played very well hes really solid and moves the puck well hes showing a little more jump in his game so were excited scott jackson also played well this week and justin courtnall showed a lot of the traits his father geoff had were looking for a lot of development from him during the next two to three years

302483 fortunately it appears the doctors were able to diagnose things early and they expect me to enjoy a complete recovery
302484 i am excited to return to coach the team during preseason camp and expect to be back out on the practice field next week
302485 this is the most important game of the season right now
302486 were two games out and weve got a back to back series against them it cant get any better than this if we want to be like those guys right now heres an opportunity for us to take advantage of the situation
302487 in order for us to win everybody has to do their part
302488 we had a great week of practice were just focused in on what we have to do here
302489 hes practised well all week and hes practised with a kind of aggressiveness that he didnt have during the time that he was injured i expect him to play well
302490 we do have skill and we count on players to make plays but its really all part of our team concept
302491 the team concept does help us when we are battling against the injuries because the players who step in expect to do well plus the people who are on the team and have those players step in expect those people to perform well
302492 when you come and play guys you know obviously you want to have bragging rights
302493 im going to come out here and im going to play my best ball
302494 i came to saskatchewan and i got my ring and now im trying to make a name for myself as one of the best players in the league
302495 it worked out better for me so i should almost send them a thank you card
302496 it was a win win for both teams because lazeo definitely came in and has been a vocal leader for us and a leader for us on the field
302497 he brings a lot of nastiness to our offensive line which we kind of need
302498 we feel like we can go out and make some plays
302499 weve got to score earlier and often if we score early and often well be all right
302500 i think we were in a bit of a difficult circumstance and we made something good out of it you may not be as familiar with jason bay because hes been in the national league but hes a really good player
302501 there were some things going on with the team that were real not just imagined
302502 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault and there was a dynamic that was created that made it difficult for us to go out and play our best
302503 they needed a left fielder im going to play left field and i cant wait
302504 hes going to help our club hes under control for next year at a reasonable salary and given the totality of the circumstances we think it was absolutely the right thing to do
302505 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to
302506 from what everyone says about boston and having played here a couple of years ago in interleague the atmosphere and obviously the winning i couldnt have hand picked a better place
302507 we feel like if anyone can come and step in and contribute to a winning club in this environment jason bay has the opportunity to do that
302508 this is a guy that has been playing in pittsburgh where theyve been trying to reach a really competitive environment for several years now
302509 whats important to us whats been important to us handling frustration handling distractions and whats made the red sox so special and how do we go about that
302510 it was an exciting time to stand in front of your players and our players and feel like that i think we all felt that way and it was a good feeling
302511 he had a remarkable run here his whole career has been remarkable
302512 hes one of the best right handed hitters in history and his numbers speak for themselves he was a key part of two world series teams no one can ever take that away from him and were not going to try to
302513 i dont know why any quarterback wouldnt want to be a part of this im much more comfortable now than the first few days thats for sure this is the most throwing well do at any time to blow it out in the first few weeks would be dumb when your pitch count is that high its time for a day off
302514 im still going to try to take advantage of the reps i get out there obviously there will be a difference with three guys instead of two as far as the numbers go other than that whether youre competing against one or two guys that really doesnt change my mind set
302515 that was in the plan all along as far as how to get these guys some rest
302516 naturally its his turn now i am confident that we have three quarterbacks we can win with i feel very good about that but the competition obviously is still going on
302517 a kid dropped in and put eight stitches in my ankle i was already skating the ramp and he rolled in on me
302518 im just glad i didnt hit him i actually jumped over him somehow spiderman style and landed on the top of the deck but his board got me
302519 it didnt seem that bad because it was just a cut but my whole ankle turned into a giant cankle
302520 i couldnt do anything i had to hobble around for a good three weeks or more
302521 requiring proof of actual transfers would cripple efforts to enforce copyright owners rights online
302522 you want to be smart and not lose him for an extended period
302523 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
302524 whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come
302525 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
302526 if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
302527 hopefully its going to take a lot of pressure off me and and the rest of the receivers
302528 one with his speed two with his experience hes had a couple of dropped balls we dont want to look over those and were going to continue to improve that but it is nice to see us completing balls behind the defense the deep balls its nice to see that the receiving corps as a whole begins to gain confidence tarvaris begins to gain confidence in them that breeds a pretty good thing for us
302529 you like to be able to get chunks when you can get chunks
302530 its very hard to sustain those 14 play drives explosives end up being huge when you can find one you can hit
302531 i hate standing on the sidelines its the worst thing ever
302532 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
302533 im happy to be here and whatever happened in boston happened
302534 im excited to be here in a new league a new team and im going to try my best
302535 this is a new chapter in my life and i want to come here and play and move on
302536 like i said im happy to be here and thats all i can say los angeles is a great city and im proud to be a dodger
302537 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys
302538 theres been the ups and the downs and i wish everyone the best but im in a new city and im ready to move on
302539 im here in a new league and im going to try to do what i do best baseball
302540 every day theres something to be learned whether youre young or old
302541 i think he will do a lot for everybodys personality for one and also the fact that you certainly dont want to pitch to manny with men on base chances are the guys hitting in front of him will get some good pitches to hit
302542 i dont want to be treated differently than the other guys
302543 im going to give all i can and try to help this team win im excited to be a dodger excited to wear blue and well what happens
302544 if the news channel is telling you about a disaster but it is broadcasting footage of a bright sunny day then im fine
302545 i just think we did a lot of episodes we basically did two seasons in one last year it seems like its been on like longer
302546 coming to work with four cars down inoperable was a real hindrance luckily we still had two vehicles out on the road on patrol that will be used
302547 im able to pinch hit the next three nights and catch in an emergency
302548 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
302549 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
302550 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges
302551 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
302552 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum
302553 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
302554 i have often been called a nazi and although it is unfair i dont let it bother me i dont let it bother me for one simple reason no one has ever had a sexual fantasy about being tied to a bed and ravished by a liberal

302565 the fence was up in good condition we dont know how it got out
302566 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
302567 put your sword away those who will take the sword will die by the sword
302568 there is not one of you muslims there is not one of you muslims but will pass over hell

302570 whoever hears my voice and believes in me he has been transformed from this to life
302571 the eu s chosen symbol was the woman riding the beast the depiction of the same symbol was reproduced on the centenary stamp of the e u and in a huge painting in the parliaments new building in brussels as if that werent enough it was repeated again in a huge sculpture outside the new e u council of ministers office in brussels for good measure
302572 if we dont stand together the broken system we have now a system where special interests drown out the voices of the american people will continue to erode our politics and prevent the possibility of real change
302573 join me and declare your independence from this broken system and lets build the first general election campaign thats truly funded by the american people
302574 especially because i support a robust system of public financing of elections
302575 senator obama is committed to reforming the current system and i look forward to working on this and a wide range of other reform issues with him when he becomes president but this decision was a mistake
302576 should both major party nominees elect to receive public funding this would preserve the public financing system now in danger of collapse and facilitate the conduct of campaigns freed from any dependence on private fund raising
302577 senator john mccain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge
302578 i do not expect that a workable effective agreement will be reached overnight
302579 when the time comes we will talk and our commitment will be tested i will pass that test and i hope that the republican nominee passes his
302580 tell his millions of small dollar donors that they couldnt invest financially in his campaign
302581 of course republicans will whine that obama broke his promise theyve got no other choice mccain is getting crushed financially and has little of the popular support that obama enjoys
302582 just donated another 50 and promised to give another 200 on june 30
302583 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
302584 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
302585 trees are the earths endless effort to speak to the listening heaven
302586 it came down to picking the school that showing me the most love and that school was michigan
302587 they have been recruiting me hard for a while now and that was one of the big reasons i decided on going there for the next four years of my life
302588 i took a recruiting trip there earlier this year and after i saw the campus i knew it was the place for me picking michigan was a big step for me knowing that i have a spot secured at the division i level is big its a relief now i can focus on bringing back some of the tradition there
302589 for all i know our navy was shooting at whales out there
302590 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
302591 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
302592 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
302593 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
302594 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
302595 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
302596 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means
302597 american public if you get the right incident the american public will support bang bang kiss kiss you know were into it
302598 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

302615 voc s podem desenvolver um jogo em que a ps3 seja a plataforma superior mas para isso t m que desenvolv lo de uma forma diferente da habitual se forem desenvolver um jogo da forma como as pessoas fazem jogos hoje em dia a 360 a melhor plataforma
302616 na teoria se fizerem muitas simula es v o ter uma melhor performance no processador cell do que nos processadores da xbox 360 mas isso na teoria

302620 naturalmente hemos o do a los miembros del consejo afirmando que no habr paz sin justicia pero nosotros tenemos un argumento similar no habr justicia sin paz por lo que tenemos que manejar la justicia y la paz de una manera equilibrada

302624 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
302625 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
302626 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
302627 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
302628 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
302629 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
302630 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
302631 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
302632 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
302633 um thank you for inviting me to your school you have a beautiful country largely because of the trees
302634 their calling sites are on the steep banks of fast flowing bodies of water
302635 humans pretty much have to shout at one another to be heard here a bit like on a saturday night down the disco
302636 but the frog doesnt shout instead it sings like a bird either in audible chirp like frequencies or by emitting very high pitched ultrasonic sounds then it simply singles out a female frog it likes
302637 we said this is bizarre in all textbooks on sound communication and hearing in frogs it is plainly stated that the eustachian tubes are permanently open
302638 on the one hand i am surprised that any frog or any animal can open and close them
302639 but on the other hand i am not too surprised that this frog does it because it is also the first to be shown to have ultrasonic hearing and calls with ultrasonic components
302640 if you ever mention my home the fire or my dog again ill prove to you what kind of man i am
302641 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
302642 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
302643 a large number of variations in the appearance of normal female genitalia
302644 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm

302646 the mammoth government bailouts of failing home lenders fannie mae and freddie mac have sparked widespread relief that the worst case economic scenario has apparently been avoided
302647 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
302648 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
302649 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
302650 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
302651 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
302652 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
302653 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
302654 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
302655 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
302656 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
302657 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
302658 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
302659 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
302660 basta ang mahalaga di ka pa ubos andyan ka pa rin para pag dumating yung taong magmamahal sa yo may maibabalik ka pa
302661 because theres so much pain in your heart kaya hindi mo mararamdamang mahal kita
302662 dont make me feel i have to love you back
302663 mapapagod ka lang umasa mapapagod ka lang maghintay mapapagod ka lang umasang mamahalin ka
302664 kahit minsan hindi ko naramdamang nakakapagod kang mahalin ngayon lang
302665 pag ikaw ba nagmahal dapat ka bang humingi ng kapalit na pagmamahal dapat mo bang antayin na mahalin ka pabalik

302667 obama theyre going to try to make you afraid of me theyre going to theyre going to say you know what hes young and inexperienced and and hes got a funny name did i mention hes black
302668 obama could pick my mother and i still wouldnt vote for him
302669 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
302670 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
302671 they have goaded obama into this comment that i think is from i think i agree with roland he went too far
302672 she is the one who understands this fight shes been in these fights before she knows how to handle herself in a fight
302673 so presumably the increase in mortality rates must be linked to something that happened earlier than i m f funding this is just phony science
302674 but when you have more than 20 correlations pointing in the same direction you start building a strong case for causality

302687 the legislature s decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaskan and lower 48 consumers
302688 refiners margins for gasoline which are historically weaker in the winter season before gaining strength in the summer driving season have remained low at levels not seen since 1999
302689 key factors in this weakness have been the rapid increase in crude prices together with widespread north american economic weakness causing decreased demand and compressing profit margins

302691 its dead in the water because the concert was a success there was hope of a tour but that was a lot of speculation it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water

302705 the visible light from the sun is essential on the other hand the uv light is often unnecessary for us even harmful to the human body so i tried to utilize the uv light by converting it into electricity
302706 we can utilize uv and visible light from the sun at the same time by using one device
302707 the efficiency of our transparent cell is very small it is the weak point of our device
302708 i believe that the full use of solar energy is necessary
302709 its a big increase but the office has been getting by on a shoestring
302710 the threat from these devices in the united states is not only real but growing
302711 this system will help bring a whole new level of safety to helicopter crews by addressing one of the greatest hazards they face
302712 we look forward to working with oads to quickly bring this technology to our military customers
302713 our landsafe solution will save lives and expand the operational envelope of rotary wing aircraft
302714 for the first time rotary winged aircraft will have the ability to land and take off at unprepared landing sites anywhere in the world providing operational commanders with a true expeditionary capability
302715 additionally this is a great example of transitioning a new technology developed under the small business innovation research program to production
302716 rockwell collins has a great reputation for providing high quality state of the art products to the aviation community oads is excited about working together to introduce this technology under this licensing relationship to the aviation community
302717 were working to solve the brownout problem in an integrated affordable end to end system
302718 its far and away the most dangerous thing you can do as a helicopter pilot im essentially flying a controlled crash into the ground with no outside reference
302719 when we went into iraq for the second time we saw a real spike in brownout mishaps
302720 so were looking at a variety of different sensors right now weve been looking at radar because it has potentially greater ability to see through sand
302721 were developing a system thats almost sensor agnostic for the 60m
302722 for procurement of war replacement ah 64d apache longbow aircraft
302723 the following are considered replacements to vehicles weapons requested in the military table of equipment mtoe
302724 were well aware that theres a virtually insatiable appetite for these systems and their capabilities
302725 we know we have to generate more of them as quickly as we can and thats our goal no ones working harder to do that than us
302726 its absolutely reasonable to assume that if we had more over there we could do more with them
302727 in this unmanned system theres a lot of people involved a lot more than in my f 16 certainly
302728 today we have 27 combat air patrols of predators and reapers flying and were building towards 50
302729 in essence our goal is to not let personnel be the limiting factor we want to reach the point where the equipment is intact and we will continue to build to stay ahead of that bow wave as long as we need to
302730 thats made a huge difference already were putting a lot more ordnance on target supporting the guys on the ground with that airplane
302731 thats just a huge presence over the target area working for the guys on the ground
302732 back in the old days it used to be that the uavs did the dumb dirty and dangerous thats not true anymore were conducting very complex multi ship tactics and operations that nobody would ever term as dumb
302733 a new cockpit would be a great and wonderful thing
302734 i have to make 17 plus different mouse clicks in pull down menus in my aviator thought process that doesnt make much sense i would much rather have a cockpit where i reach over here arm select and shoot
302735 in my f 16 i get rid of the weapon with one switch
302736 i want to be able to fly and employ this airplane just like i fly and employ a manned asset
302737 that entails a lot more training and a whole different skill set
302738 its one thing to do single plane operations its another step forward to control two or three and only a couple of people can do four ship its a big training bill to pay
302739 in terms of sheer fun its way more fun to climb up the ladder and get in the airplane
302740 but in terms of combat effect i know every time i open the door of the ground control station im going to be looking at stuff on the ground talking to the guys on the ground and trying to get them out of harms way
302741 that translates into a mission accomplishment frankly that i dont know you get flying airplanes
302742 of all the things ive lost i miss my mind the most
302743 voy a hablar con el presidente de la rep blica el ministro del interior y con protecci n social para que den pronta soluci n a esto que los aqueja pero temas como subsidios de vivienda ingreso a la universidad distrital y afiliaci n al r gimen subsidiado de salud se trabajaran de manera directa porque podemos hacerlo en el tema de reparaci n y tierras que le compete al gobierno nacional no puedo intervenir

302755 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative
302756 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world

302790 sit down youll have a chance to ask your questions but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous

302794 i was a civil rights lawyer i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois
302795 i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois so these are issues ive worked on for decades

302820 the right to vote is one of the most vital and inalienable rights in our great nation for our armed forces however carrying out that right is too often marred in bureaucratic hurdles and complications blunt said the fact that less than 17 percent of the 6 million citizens serving our nation overseas eligible to vote participated in the 2006 election demonstrates the overwhelming need to address this problem that is why i have introduced this resolution today to urge the department of defense to take every step to educate our armed forces about participating in this years historic election
302821 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote

302839 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
302840 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
302841 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
302842 the trial aims to recruit 56 000 people across the uk treat any who show signs of h pylori infection and follow them over 15 to 20 years to see if this treatment is effective
302843 you know how these people are after they suffer a head injury

302854 first priority bank bradenton florida was closed today by the commissioner of the florida office of financial regulation and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic was named receiver to protect the depositors the fdic entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with suntrust bank atlanta georgia to assume the insured deposits of first priority
302855 the exemption in the new law which was requested by the fdic without objection by the feds board of governors was aimed at making clear that once banks are taken over by the fdic capital rules no longer apply because they are effectively owned operated and in liquidation by the government

302866 michelle wants to be home when they get home from camp
302867 weve always been the kind of people who go to the soccer games shop at target go for bike rides and make sure the girls get to the sleepovers theyve been invited to
302868 we still do that but we usually have a lot of people watching now
302869 my children force me to keep my feet on the ground
302870 no matter what happens on any given day i am malia and sashas mom and i will struggle with that balance all of my life my first priority is to make sure the girls are ok how is school going how do they feel on any given day what activities do they have going that consumes me
302871 the outreach is about acknowledging that we are set ital all end ital women you know what its like on the campaign trail i can be a lot more effective talking about issues that are relevant to me i feel guilty working and juggling my responsibilities as a parent if im still struggling with this there have to be other women who do too
302872 for me its not personal the way i see it there are a lot of people like me like how i am about my husband my candidate they invested their hearts and souls into hillary clinton and many of them did this for years they have to figure out how they want to leverage their political power i understand that politics is a patience game you cant do this unless you have patience
302873 i wear so many different hats in my life the story i come out of is the story of most americans lives the stuff we talked about around the table is the same when you see your parents who dont have much getting out of bed and sucking it up every day you learn a lot about values
302874 i need stability and evenness and not paying attention to media coverage helps its usually either really really good or really really bad which doesnt reflect what people are thinking
302875 my first reaction to that was oh my goodness this is awful fortunately our girls are young enough where they dont read the new yorker
302876 my view as a mom is there isnt a right moment for this kind of thing when it comes up is when we talk about it
302877 when barack was first thinking about it a part of me was asking how hard will it be for me but the other part of me was asking how can i not support this man i could have held him back if i had asked him not to run absolutely he would not have done it
302878 the michelle obama i was last year is the same michelle obama i am this year different circumstances same michelle
302879 i told them dad had a big night and it appears hes going to be the democratic nominee for president
302880 this is really a big deal theres never been an african american nominee for president do you guys realize the significance of this
302881 well african americans used to be slaves and we couldnt vote and we didnt have many rights so of course this is a big deal
302882 just like it would also be a really big deal if hillary clinton had won because there has never been a woman nominee for president and women used to not be able to vote and didnt have many rights either
302883 a development studio has been established in san francisco ca with hopes of gathering those who wish to join us in starting a new chapter of history in the game industry

302888 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
302889 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
302890 excuse me young men this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later let me make my statement why dont you all sit down then you can ask your question thats why were having a town hall meeting sit down youll have a chance to answer your question but you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous thats all all you got to do is be courteous thats all just be courteous and youll have a chance to make your statement

302895 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
302896 remember when the city was full of life now its just be full of commercial
302897 inside every empowered woman is a pussycat doll purring and hissing her way out they have that special kind of confidence every woman can understand what that means and live that philosophy every day every woman wants to be sexy and feel sexy its all about a girl who is very confident and loves to get dressed up like a doll not trashy or slutty but somebody who everyday whether walking down the street or going to the store just owns it with attitude and empowerment a pussycat doll gets up on stage and performs with that same confidence that every woman can have with the same feeling and same vibe about owning every day owning your womanhood its easier today for women to seize this empowerment and enjoy it it wasnt so easy in years gone by because they had to hide and cover up their strengths and just show weakness thank goodness times have changed and weve now got that power
302898 in the pussycat dolls lounge everything is carefully choreographed but in the casino i didnt just want a go go dancer without dance training you can make go go dancing look so much better if you have that training its the same kind of girl but in the pit they have to provide a theatrical performance at the same time as the dancing i am really happy with them theyre energetic appealing and sexy in my wildest dreams i never would have imagined us being part of a casino its so incredible their outfits in the gaming pit pictured above are not exactly the same as in the lounge i designed uniform styled outfits that are just as sexy but somewhat different and now we will be selling merchandise and pcd lingerie inspired by those costumes
302899 pure already is home to the las vegas pussycat dolls lounge and now this casino is the final part of a dream come true i began the pussycat dolls 12 years ago but only dreamed about opening a casino the last few years you always think something could go wrong and its not going to happen but honestly everything was completely smooth with this venture my partners at caesars and pure were great and i cant believe we are actually here this is such a new chapter in my life and the life of the dolls incidentally our tv show search for the next pussycat doll premieres on tuesday in the tv show we use all our vegas casino fun stuff to tie in with the show a lot of the lingerie will start in the pit and lead to the lounge and then to your own home
302900 were tackling that competition head on its the same demographic and with a nightclub on the gaming floor weve got them beat these are just beautiful women they are not being suggestive or vulgar we watch that very carefully and dancing up a storm theyre even sexier with their clothes still on the reaction is incredible its far more than we ever expected the energy and excitement is terrific and everybody male and female young and old enjoys and welcomes their special brand of glitz and glamour we had our soft opening back on super bowl weekend and its just gone from strength to strength the numbers are really solid our dealers have great personalities and upbeat positive attitudes its become another must see attraction at caesars this has been such a big success leading up to tonights official celebrity opening that were now going to expand the 9pm 4am hours and start from noon everyday right throughout march madness well then keep the pussycats casino open much longer than we have been
302901 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
302902 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
302903 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
302904 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
302905 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
302906 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
302907 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
302908 i want to be in vegas i need to be in vegas
302909 this is in your face comedy and an all you can stand laugh fest
302910 wow this is incredible the turnout the reaction is way more than anybody expected now from our soft opening well fine tune everything and work out the kinks and be absolutely perfect for our grand vip opening on march 3
302911 i promise to get all the paperwork in order well release the silverton from all responsibility and liability and well return to perform the escape i have to do it
302912 then i have to be able to get my hand outside the exposed bar and pick one lock and then unravel an un known combination of a second lock and then get to the surface without blowing out my eardrums from the pressure
302913 this has never been done before underwater i have to hold my breath and the steel box which is no larger than an animal luggage box used on airlines gives me absolutely no room for movement
302914 ive trained myself to hold my breath for up to four minutes underwater but with all the exertion of getting out of the metal cuffs on my hands and feet the air gets used up much faster if i could get out in 30 seconds believe me i would but it takes almost the length of the hold of my breath theres not much room for safety
302915 houdini did this escape once in a wooden box with no openings he had it lowered into a murky river so nobody could see anything ive been called the 21st century houdini and i wanted my fans to see me inside the box and getting free

302917 lautorit europea per la sicurezza alimentare efsa ha ritenuto che lesposizione della popolazione europea al bpa compresi i lattanti sia inferiore ai limiti considerati di tollerabilit
302918 non dimostrato che tali effetti nocivi sulla salute possano verificarsi anche a basse dosi di esposizione
302919 oggi quindi ha concluso milana sono previsti precisi limiti di sicurezza ma chiaro che a fronte di nuovi dati scientifici validi circa gli effetti del bpa questi andrebbero rivalutati se per non interverranno nuove conoscenze scientifiche validate non c ragione di rivederli
302920 la deliberata spietatezza con la quale la popolazione operaia stata usata per aumentare la produzione di beni di consumo e dei profitti che ne derivano si ora estesa su tutta la popolazione del pianeta coinvolgendone la componente pi fragile che sono i bambini sia con lesposizione diretta alla pletora di cancerogeni mutageni e sostanze tossiche presenti nell acqua aria suolo cibo sia con le conseguenze della sistematica e accanita distruzione del nostro habitat

302923 ultimately it is up to the people to decide if 30 years is long enough to wait before taking a fresh look at our state constitution this is one of the most important questions facing hawaii voters this year
302924 thefts and robberies happen until the system of money exists if money is abolished and moneyless mode of production and distribution is introduced no one will have need to commit theft
302925 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
302926 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
302927 its a shame that peoples awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles
302928 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks
302929 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
302930 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
302931 comments like those arent productive he should instead be focused on the generous incentives package weve offered
302932 ive got a pro wrestling match aug 15 in tokyo japan

302947 smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science it is not medicine and it is not safe
302948 legalization of marijuana no matter how it begins will come at the expense of our children and public safety it will create dependency and treatment issues and open the door to use of other drugs impaired health delinquent behavior and drugged drivers
302949 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
302950 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors
302951 we made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new merlin engines at once
302952 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert
302953 un paso m s para avanzar en esta ciudad que todos nos merecemos tenemos el programa cambio verde en el cual se ha avanzado en una serie de aspectos hace pocos d as tuvieron la informaci n sobre la separaci n de residuos domiciliarios en siete jefes candioti sur y guadalupe en un trabajo conjunto con la cervecer a santa fe mcdonalds la fundaci n h bitat y desarrollo y con la fundaci n dignidad y vida sana esa recolecci n diferenciada permiti la donaci n de 650 litros de leche al hospital alassia se est trabajando en el primer punto verde en varadero sarsotti

302962 source port randomization to improve resilience against dns cache poisoning attacks
302963 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the internet protocol weakness
302964 we know with microsoft that there were a few problems even installing their dns patch
302965 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
302966 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
302967 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already
302968 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death

302977 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
302978 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

303040 i think a roommate you can get along with is extremely important to having fun in college
303041 some colleges feel it is important to make as good a match as possible other campuses feel college is a time to expand your horizons a little bit

303060 the americans have all along known about the isis collaboration with the taliban they knew the political leadership of the taliban including mullah omar were in quetta they knew when jalaluddin haqqani was in pakistan earlier it didnt suit their interest to admit this but now that the fellows trained to fight in kashmir are fighting in afghanistan and killing american soldiers theyre feeling the heat
303061 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead

303112 i make a mental note of the things that need to be stocked up during the next shopping trip
303113 it would not be easy to put it down on paper if i wanted somebody else to do the shopping
303114 while i am doing my shopping i also think about the dishes i want to cook immediately recalling what other items are needed to prepare them
303115 i bought a handful of daun kesum as i decided to fry some of the ikan kembung
303116 i know my supply of turmeric powder which is needed for the dish is running low so i bought a packet of that as well
303117 some of the food could well expire or go bad by the time i need to use them defeating the purpose of having them in my kitchen the first place
303118 meat and chicken keep fresh longer so i normally cook the fish first
303119 my refrigerator also stays fresh longer because odour inducing fish is never kept in the freezer for long
303120 i would complement the asam pedas ikan kembung with fried chicken as my kids like to eat fried chicken dipped in asam pedas gravy
303121 frequently i am asked to help the poorest nations in the world many of whom have already received billions of dollars in aid over many decades
303122 i reply get good governance get a proper judiciary proper laws
303123 get a reputation that there is a commercial and criminal legal system that operates fairly and then wait for businesses to come because they will
303124 but they will not come to nations that treat the rule of law as an optional extra or even worse as an impediment
303125 it means rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair
303126 these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
303127 though in exceptional circumstances that it is possible to have the rule of law without true democracy it is impossible to have true democracy without the rule of law
303128 the rule of law is an indispensable part of good governance and good governance is an indispensable part of a successful state
303129 i have long ago learned to distrust the myth that some people love democracy and some people are at ease with dictatorship that some revere the rule of law and some are indifferent to it or that some prize liberty and some despise it
303130 i received muraleedharans resignation letter this morning yesterday and as an interim measure we have appointed rajan to handle the national juniors for the razak cup
303131 the coaching committee will make its recommendation for a new coach as soon as possible and we will announce it after the council meets on aug 16
303132 muraleedharan did state his reason for quitting but i cant reveal the contents of his letter we will leave it in the hands of the coaching committee and the council to decide on that
303133 we guarantee that consumers can can buy vegetables like in normal days from tomorrow

303136 how are they going to control the stock some of us still measure our stocks manually before informing the oil companies to replenish it

303138 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
303139 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
303140 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
303141 the biggest threat for me are the younger competitors like robles from cuba and american david oliver
303142 in the last two years these guys have really improved and oliver has broken the 13 second barrier
303143 in athens i was among the younger hurdlers so i had to fight for a good result
303144 at that time i was fighting against others but this time other hurdlers are aiming at me
303145 young players like rooney ronaldo and nani just have to look at players like ryan
303146 he has learnt and is still learning he wants to improve you have scholes and neville too they are the hardest working players in training because they want to improve
303147 they know theyve not got 10 years left of their career so they want to make the most of it
303148 for scholes it doesnt matter to him if its the champions league final or a training match hes just desperate to play
303149 i genuinely believe in my heart of hearts with the way that i felt at the end of last season that i will come back this season
303150 ive trained through the summer and i genuinely feel ill be fine but until youve gone out there and done it it means nothing
303151 i want to play in europe because its the only way to play in the colombian national team
303152 when i came back from berlin i couldnt live where i wanted
303153 i wasnt invited to shake hands with hitler but i wasnt invited to the white house to shake hands with the president either
303154 you can melt down all the medals and cups i have and they wouldnt be a plating on the twenty four carat friendship that i felt for lutz long

303156 these express bus operators have been operating at a loss for quite a while because they have to deal with the increase in operational and management costs as well as the increasing price of spare parts and maintenance costs
303157 we need to give a clearer picture as to problems faced by these bus operators some companies have even shut down because they cannot cope with the losses several others have been reduced to selling off their assets to pay off bank loans
303158 the 30 per cent surcharge was proposed by the pan malaysia bus operators association to help express bus operators cope with the loss of profits during the festive season
303159 during the festive season their passengers are only going one way and the bus is mostly empty during their return trip so they cannot make any profit
303160 public transportation is not a profitable business it is not so much for profit than a service to the public
303161 people are confused because politically we have many problems there is squabbling slander fights and confusing suggestions
303162 it is time we set aside unhealthy political tactics and focus on gaining the confidence of the people and improving the countrys economic performance and keep foreign investors coming

303169 the big ones said not to worry and that theyd just take me with them today
303170 then they said we were going home but we didnt
303171 they were gone a long time but the girls came out to check on me several times and even brought a wet towel to lay over me to make sure i wasnt too hot but we were parked in the shade so i was fine i was tired anyway from all the excitement so i just slept mostly
303172 oh but when they came back they brought me the most delicious thing to eat
303173 im glad to be home boys but that was quite the adventure maybe if you get your head smushed in the door sometime youll get to go on an adventure too meow meow purrrrr

303199 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh

303208 spectrum in the 2 1 ghz band will be allocated for 3g telecom services throughout the country
303209 we may give licences to up to 10 operators it depends on the availability of spectrum initially we will have five players in delhi and mumbai there will be two private operators only the licence will have a validity of 20 years
303210 the 3g policy and auction guidelines would allow for an open global and transparent auction process consistent with international best practices

303382 a marriage between three persons is not possible in the netherlands but a civil union is we went to the notary in our marriage costume and exchanged rings we consider this to be just an ordinary marriage
303383 but this is because mirjam and bianca are bisexual i think that with two heterosexual women it would be more difficult
303384 to be honest and open with each other and not philander
303385 marriage denotes civil marriage i e marriage as the law exclusively defines it
303386 contracts that settle the cohabitation of more than two persons can have a useful ordering function
303387 have celebrated and publicly confirmed their samenlevingscontract as a marriage this is about an intimate communion which is more than just a practical arrangement
303388 from a christian democrat minister one might have expected a less acquiescent attitude in such a sensitive matter

303410 i love vampire movies and i love love stories at the end of the day all that really matters to me at least is the story that is being told it doesnt matter if its horror thriller sci fi if that the story being told is something relatable and interesting and then i enjoy it
303411 her energy made you want to push forward and keep powering through and gave you that extra lift
303412 literally i went from a mixed martial arts movie to a movie with people who had superhuman speed and strength it was very different there was a lot of wire work because these people they cant have normal fights because every punch and every kick would cause the other to go up into the rafters really all the wire work and all the planning we had to be very specific if someones gonna hit someone here what would that actually do youre looking at every little thing whereas with a fight with humans its just a fight with humans every last thing was judged and turned around and upside down and just tried to figure it out and then once we actually executed it all the wire work was 90 percent of the fight even watching it its unreal its real but its extreme everything looked real in the entire movie all those fights

303438 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
303439 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

303442 it is no less difficult on the soldier today than it was on day one we know weve been there but were not finished serving not until our bravest get the care they need and every troop comes home

303459 the collapse of the british energy deal is bad news for uk consumers
303460 while the government is paralysed by its own childish in fighting this summer british consumers are being hit by wave after wave of energy price hikes
303461 no political party should be considered electable until it commits itself to new coal stations to new nuclear plant and to the improved import and storage of gas above all we want and need to hear on this from the currently empty vessel that is david cameron and the conservative party
303462 oi sarky now were really narky over eu treaty malarky
303463 back in 1993 when ukip was first set up euroscepticism was a minority sport if you went to a dinner party and said britain would be better off outside the eu it would be considered so extraordinary so off the wall you would never be invited back
303464 since the irish vote they have been pretty unpleasant to us
303465 we have been called mentally ill and our behaviour has been likened to the national socialist party in germany its pretty vicious stuff we have never seen it before
303466 the people are blowing the trumpets around the city walls
303467 you sit there with our countrys flag but you do not represent our countrys interests these are our partners and colleagues this is 2005 not 1945 we are not fighting each other any more
303468 that soured the atmosphere because it led to a great raft of legislation
303469 we had a british regulation on lawnmower noise so it made sense to have a single piece of legislation
303470 we would hire a tank and send over a couple of page 3 girls to be fair we were always treated with a great deal of courtesy
303471 if it was just a free trade area then yes
303472 but its no to taxation to a european army its preposterous ridiculous even if it is commercially damaging to run these stories on the front page it will create a long term good feeling for our readers
303473 in june this year it was only the 18th most mentioned issue facing britain
303474 its simply not something that people vote on in general elections
303475 the failure of euroscepticism is its inability to convince people that what they are going on about is really important people havent marched against the lisbon treaty as they did for example against foxhunting even if there is broad support for the eurosceptic case it is still a minority cult
303476 most people ive met would never regard themselves as either eurosceptics or europhiles
303477 someone who is pro european has virtually no chance of being selected today
303478 you used to have the same problem when i was trying to find a seat if you said you were against capital punishment
303479 david knows he has a serious problem the question is how does he address the expectations of the extreme eurosceptics

303489 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
303490 education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed
303491 being no 1 in the coaches preseason poll does have significance since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
303492 but the postseason poll is the one that is the most important
303493 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan we need to identify these people and weed them out
303494 to harness an organization as powerful as the isi would take very careful planning and coordination and that has not happened
303495 today we are still suffering the blowback from having helped the afghan taliban
303496 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
303497 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
303498 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
303499 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
303500 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
303501 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
303502 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
303503 we were surprised when we ended up arresting these two
303504 this is a personal matter involving my family and i would like to protect my privacy

303516 in our case we have replaced 50 per cent of petrol with ethanol and also it was possible to have reduced the price of fossil fuels because of the competition with ethanol we estimate that if there was not ethanol the petrol price would be 30 per cent higher in brazil
303517 robinsons has come a long way in reducing its impact on the environment in the past two years but as always we are focused on further packaging reductions as well as energy and water usage reductions across all britvic brands and at all our manufacturing sites
303518 the eus carbon trading scheme is the central pillar of our climate policy not only for reducing emissions but also for building a global climate change agreement
303519 corner gas has no laugh track you laugh a lot as my wife has noted when im watching it and shes in the other room or when im watching it with headphones on but mostly you grin and the great thing about watching it on dvd is you can periodically replay a line and catch the nuances because the humor often works on about three levels including the most basic and a bit of thinking is required to get to the other two
303520 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
303521 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
303522 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
303523 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
303524 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
303525 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
303526 what do we do hes just going to block us in
303527 if he does ill call the cops if he doesnt drive straight to the police station and park in the parking lot
303528 i will but i need to know whats going on what the hell is she thinking

303540 behind your moms body now leave me alone im writing my sunday sermon
303541 im thinking that shes probably been there for a number of years
303542 part of the mystery here is that apparently none of these children were in school
303543 home schooling under this situation removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe
303544 she was kind of secluded shed talk but not much
303545 it was the ideal family i mean the children were so respectful just so easygoing
303546 didnt seem to be no stress at all never got that impression never
303547 wed like to make a green energy car a plug in
303548 to control the scientific high ground and earn a seat on the worlds high technology board we will make some serious efforts to strengthen our nations competence
303549 when a country is in its early stages of development as china was 20 years ago having an export processing center is good for growth
303550 chinese firms are expanding into or buying companies that work in software and biotechnology automobiles medical devices and supercomputers this year a government backed corporation even introduced its first commercial passenger jet a move beijing hopes will allow it to some day compete with in some ways the government is only riding the economic currents that come with development and high growth for instance many manufacturers in southern china the countrys biggest export zone are moving to the interior because land and labor costs are cheaper or expanding operations to include in lower cost countries like india vietnam or bangladesh world class brands that have grown dependent on outsourcing labor intensive production to china are now searching for alternatives even the retail behemoth wal mart which moved its global procurement center here to shenzhen in 2002 is going to be forced to find new sourcing channels to fill its 5 000 stores worldwide for millions of consumers around the world experts say the policy shift could also mean higher prices for a broad array of goods from pens and hammers to barbie dolls and running shoes home depot and wal mart are going up
303551 but there is another side in some areas that chinas going to grab like telecom equipment theyll push prices lower
303552 they are some of the biggest in launching satellites they have a lot of technology locked up in the military and now the government is reducing budgets and pressing agencies to privatize
303553 so suddenly a lot of technology people thought didnt exist has come out from behind the curtain
303554 our strategy in china is to always focus on innovation
303555 were now in the domestic market but well spare no effort to grab overseas expansion

303562 turn off the lights rest your head on a cold pillow or brush your teeth and stare threateningly at your own reflection
303563 oh how the wet eyed gullie wept and wept blue veins burst and all the usual fits of nothingness groaning stars enough truisms are mumbled to keep the drunken night gods satisfied
303564 we fail to be anybody but ourselves skins tearing itself apart somehow cuts and scratches breaking out casually simultaneously dont be poetic about it put some savlon on it
303565 weeks perspired and expired it was clear i was no longer living for a youthful ideal or id remember it nor for the sake of vulgar money every thought desire urge or earning of mine was spent in the stained landscape suburbs of south london thought became flat sweetness tasted stale and soon my obsessive virtues suffered me and became vices at times those i remember i wandered round kicking up cars cursing mangey guard dogs and stealing sausage rolls or apples from costcutters one day i even became a different person and dared myself to trip off the cleopatra needle where the vodka bottles were strewn and sown so deep they could never be scrubbed too clean but i couldnt be bothered so i bought a pasty and later considered its calorie content
303566 a typical piece of new labour arrogance to have a poll and then ignore the result i suppose you are going to trot out the old line about it only being a consultation and not a binding referendum
303567 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
303568 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
303569 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
303570 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices

303572 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
303573 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
303574 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
303575 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
303576 you have to have good intelligence on the ground to hit a target like that
303577 it requires human as well as technical intelligence i think the money that the americans are spreading around is having an effect
303578 also there are troops in afghanistan prisoners being interrogated this is a long term effort that is paying off
303579 honey im going to get some water out of the pond and see if i can see amoebas in the microscope

303594 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
303595 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
303596 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
303597 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
303598 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
303599 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
303600 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
303601 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us
303602 oh hey how was china loved that picture of the guys in the rain
303603 youve got a good thing going here dont screw it up
303604 focused on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change working with opposition groups and passing money
303605 the mek has no cpa certified public accountant auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the mek is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the us administration intends
303606 the mek provided significant intelligence that helped blow the whistle on irans clandestine nuclear weapons and missile development programs

303616 i dont know losing weight is just something that i cant physically do
303617 im fat ill always be fat im just meant to be fat
303618 make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
303619 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism
303620 the use of the military in opposing drug smuggling and illegal immigration was a significant step away from the act s central tenet that there was no proper role for the military in the direct enforcement of the laws
303621 aggressive saturation patrolling ambushes and listening post operations must be conducted
303622 using force precisely and discriminately strengthens the rule of law that needs to be established
303623 national security force as big powerful and well funded as our combined u
303624 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
303625 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
303626 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
303627 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
303628 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
303629 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
303630 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
303631 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action when they get a policy directive they have certain room for maneuver keeping the interests of the state in view
303632 the pakistani army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
303633 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
303634 the karzai government is totally in the hands of india
303635 why are we always trying to allay u s fears
303636 one of the biggest blunders of our elite is to see america as a friend and ally
303637 shots were fired they realized people were hurt and some of them were able to escape and some were not
303638 immediately after the call its at a perimeter and conduct an investigation of people at that point we felt confident we could maintain that perimeter until other resources arrived
303639 they saw this person dressed in camo as we described previously exit the wooded area
303640 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
303641 military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups and few groups within this time frame achieved victory
303642 this has significant implications for dealing with al qaeda and suggests fundamentally rethinking post september 11 counterterrorism strategy
303643 second military force though not necessarily us soldiers may be a necessary instrument when al qaeda is involved in an insurgency
303644 local military forces frequently have more legitimacy to operate than the united states has and they have a better understanding of the operating environment even if they need to develop the capacity to deal with insurgent groups over the long run
303645 generally resist being drawn into combat operations in muslim societies since its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment
303646 just get the hell off americas lawn ya damn kid

303648 the day after the bush administration announced it would hold a diplomatic meeting with iran the price of oil fell by over ten percent its been on the way down ever since thats because the two are tied together while bush and cheney were threatening war with iran the world got nervous and the price of oil went up when diplomacy was tried the price of oil went down americans are paying an enormous risk premium on oil and the more belligerent we are to the middle east the higher the price goes when barack obama said hed talk with iran he was denounced by the right wing when george bush actually followed obamas lead the price of a barrel of oil came down twenty five bucks in two weeks
303649 i see that president bush spoke the other day about iraq but what he failed to mention is that he didnt meet his own deadline for hammering out a status of forces agreement with the iraqis this is because the iraqis are demanding a timeline for u s troops to withdraw from their country just like barack obama has proposed while the white house continues to try to twist prime minister malikis arm into redefining the word timeline the chances that this law will pass the iraqi parliament by the end of this year become more and more dim as time goes on maybe bush should just get a three month extension so that the next president can bargain in good faith with the iraqis rather than try to force them into agreeing to something which their own people are going to reject
303650 you know when news organizations have been telling americans for months now that obama is light on details and offers no specifics they have never seemed to apply the same standard to john mccain finally the politico website has written about this leading the story off with quote the domestic policy plans of john mccain have been notably short on details unquote i look forward to the rest of the media following up on this story by pointing out over and over again that obama has concrete proposals whereas mccain has put forth numbers that economists agree dont add up when i hear that mccain is light on details and offers no specifics from the media then i will know they are doing an unbiased job once again but im not holding my breath waiting
303651 just imagine for one moment that barack obama had been involved with a banking scandal in his past now imagine further that his son just resigned an executive position of a bank that was on the verge of failure do you think we would have heard about this in the media perhaps on an hourly basis on the cable news shows over and over and over again then ask yourself why nobody seems to be paying the slightest bit of attention to andrew mccain or for that matter even mentioning the words keating five and yet somehow the media is supposed to be on obamas side it just boggles the mind
303652 given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people
303653 john mccains new campaign team trained by karl rove is throwing a lot of mud over barack obama being a celebrity even running an ad mccain said he was proud of featuring paris hilton and britney spears funny thing though mccain used to be proud of wearing the label celebrity himself on his own campaign site until they deleted it this week that is was an associated press story which ended with and i quote a political celebrity mccain is considered a top contender for the nomination unquote so john mccain should really decide whether being a celebrity is a good thing or a bad thing or maybe its just a good thing when mccain is being called a celebrity and its now a bad thing because hes calling obama a celebrity i honestly couldnt tell you what mccain is thinking these days since hes flip flopped on so many of these types of things

303697 i met with another some eighty years of age and such a divine that youd have sworn scotus himself was revived in him he being upon the point of unfolding the mystery of the name jesus did with wonderful subtlety demonstrate that there lay hidden in those letters whatever could be said of him for that it was only declined with three cases he said it was a manifest token of the divine trinity and then that the first ended in s the second in m the third in u there was in it an ineffable mystery to wit those three letters declaring to us that he was the beginning middle and end summum medium et ultimum of all nay the mystery was yet more abstruse for he so mathematically split the word jesus into two equal parts that he left the middle letter by itself and then told us that that letter in hebrew was schin or sin and that sin in the scotch tongue as he remembered signified as much as sin from whence he gathered that it was jesus that took away the sins of the world at which new exposition the audience were so wonderfully intent and struck with admiration especially the theologians that there wanted little but that niobe like they had been turned to stones whereas the like has almost happened to me as befell the priapus in horace
303698 but if man is a rational animal how contrary is it to reason that in the conveniencies rather than the real goods of the body and in external things which fortune gives and takes away at her pleasure we had rather have the thing itself than the name and in the real goods of the mind we put more value upon the name than the thing itself

303700 in his colloquies erasmus regularly used names precisely in the fashion he satirized in on things and names erasmuss folly abused the etymologizing theologian but this did not keep erasmus himself from using the old locus of the name in the dedication of the praise of folly to thomas more mores surname is as like the greek word for folly as more himself is unlike it

303844 never allow a serb jew or gypsy to marry into his family
303845 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
303846 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
303847 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
303848 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
303849 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
303850 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
303851 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
303852 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
303853 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
303854 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
303855 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

303887 thats probably the question i get the most from other riders is how do you ride
303888 she has to hold her line she cant cut across the track
303889 say theres something in the track she wants to move over she cant really move over if shes committed to that line
303890 the noise doesnt bother her so if youre behind her the pressures not there
303891 i dont feel it i dont hear it so it doesnt bother me
303892 i have to make sure shes not lying to me
303893 it was a mud race i didnt care i just wanted to ride i got fourth place out of 12 boys so it was really fun
303894 definitely in this sport you pretty much race against boys all the time
303895 once you get old enough at 12 years old you can ride with girls but i stayed in with boys as well i raced in the amateur national championship with boys
303896 i dont know if anything was really given to me i think i worked for it
303897 i think i just work hard and i practice a lot and i try to fix the things that are not right with my riding and keep making it better
303898 snowboarding is fun im not that good at that but i like it i like making videos with my friends texting

303900 the education equality project has brought together leaders from all across the political spectrum including school chancellor joel klein and mayor michael bloomberg of new york city chancellor klein is a strong supporter of charter schools because he understands that fundamental reform is needed as he puts it in large urban areas the culture of public education is broken if you dont fix this culture then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed among others who share this conviction are mayor cory booker of newark chancellor michelle rhee of washington and harold ford junior you know that a reform movement is truly bipartisan when j c watts and al sharpton are both members and today i am proud to add my name as well to the list of those who support the aims and principles of the education equality project but one name is still missing senator obamas my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness the education equality project is a practical plan for delivering change and restoring hope for children and parents who need a lot of both and if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

303941 i realize this is not a burning issue but does anyone know how to change the color of the new mome local idisk icon i dont particularly care for the current pink color
303942 if youre physically close enough to make using a flash drive to transfer files sneakernet feasible why not use an ethernet based lan idisk was never intended to replace a lan
303943 fwiw in leopard ive found idisk completely usable its not very fast to mount but not much slower than mounting a remote web site in golive for example
303944 not exactly a stellar advertisement for os x servers ability to scale im assuming thats what they are using
303945 apple has now responded to a flood of complaints about the botched mobileme roll out and lack of related information for customers with an oddly written anonymous posting
303946 i see the download arrow on the web page version of the idisk it appears to allow one to download one file at a time is there a way to download multiple files at a time or a folder at a time
303947 uploading to idisk is no slower or faster than your internet upload connection speed
303948 unless im missing something i dont see a way of only syncing certain address book groups with mobileme and the iphone
303949 uploading to idisk is no slower or faster than your internet upload connection speed
303950 my problem with the idisk has always been that the progress bar is misleading
303951 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules we are not going to let this decision get in the way of our mission which is to deliver a budget that reflects the values of californians

303956 we need to be reading more widely different authors and genres and making them available to others me
303957 enter certain information about yourself and display your knowledge most of these paid surveys take only 15 minutes to complete once completed you are paid its that simple
303958 isnt this a great place ive never been here before
303959 you can always do better but i thought our guys came out with a good attitude enthusiasm effort and good retention we are going to have to make sure we are on the right path to victory all the intangibles are there we just have to put the basics in place which is defense hustling to the ball sure handed tackles when we get the pads on and protecting the ball on offense
303960 it tests your mental toughness a little bit we assume our guys are tough we really do we dont look at a guy and say oh hes not tough because hes not working at the speed we want we are under the consideration that we need to be careful with them because with the heat that the health of our student athletes is one thing we always monitor out here we expect our guys to be tough and we expect them to play hard and if they start to get winded or light headed we will stop and get them water
303961 i think what stood out was the effort overall thats the main thing and thats what we have to play with if its an intangible you have to have it effort attitude toughness tenacity intelligence heart grit you know all of those things when they talk about baylor football is what they have to talk about we have to control the things we can control and thats what we look for in our football players before today was make sure they did the little things right
303962 right now it looks like robert griffin are going to play i would be surprised if that did not work out for them and i would be surprised if there werent some others before its all said and done
303963 they are feeling the heat but we arent asking them to make plays at the first team level we are just asking them to listen learn and help us with the scout team right now
303964 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped
303965 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
303966 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
303967 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
303968 one need look no further than todays fcc decision for proof that engineering challenges on the internet should be solved by engineers not government officials
303969 in second guessing reasonable network management techniques with no notice or guidelines in place that benefit the overwhelming number of broadband subscribers in america the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
303970 today fcc chairman martin and commissioners adelstein and copps took an important step to preserve the ability of hundreds of millions of users of the internet to access the applications and content of their choice without interference by their broadband providers

303978 esto reci n empieza como se lo hab a aclarado no s lo a villa sino a todos los dem s va a ser muy competitivo porque todos van a querer jugar pero pasa por el rendimiento por el trabajo que haga durante la semana y por supuesto en los partidos que es lo m s importante
303979 brasil acept par metros que argentina no estaba dispuesta a aceptar pero al formar parte de una uni n aduanera mercosur no pueden estar en desacuerdo porque se rompe esa uni n y eso es muy grave

303985 se le ped a un esfuerzo mayor a los pa ses en desarrollo en vez de a los desarrollados
303986 si un tipo tiene una efectividad por debajo de tres carreras en la nacional es uno de los mejores lanzadores de las mayores
303987 el deber a tener entre 14 15 triunfos con su extraordinaria labor pero el equipo no le ha respaldado ni con la ofensiva ni con el bullpen si sigue lanzando el resto de su carrera en nueva york como lo ha hecho hasta ahora johan ser un asiduo ganador de 20 juegos con el equipo johan es el tipo de pelotero que todo el mundo quiere tener un competidor que cubre todos los aspectos del juego se preocupa por todo el juego es un gran atleta y un excelente fildeador
303988 ha ganado solamente nueve juegos porque no hemos hecho lo que estamos supuestos a hacer ofensivamente ha lanzado muy bien y estamos realmente emocionados de tenerlo con nosotros es un excelente pitcher y es nuestro as del pitcheo cada vez que johan sale a lanzar nosotros tenemos una gran oportunidad de ganar
303989 tengo que seguir trabajando igual de fuerte pero uno no tiene el control total para ganar juegos
303990 a uno lo deber an juzgar por los innings lanzados los ponches los hits recibidos y las bases por bolas que son las cosas sobre las cuales uno individualmente tiene m s control independientemente de ganar o perder yo me preparo para darle la oportunidad de ganar al equipo cada vez que estoy en la lomita pero una vez que yo salgo del partido no tengo el control si todo fuera tan f cil a lo mejor tendr a m s triunfos pero la cosa no es as y sta es la verdadera realidad
303991 la liga nacional te obliga a estar preparado para el juego en todos los innings al ponerte a batear porque cualquier detalle hace la diferencia entre una victoria y una derrota y uno puede ser ese detalle tanto en la lomita como en el home
303992 estoy trabajando en ello y ya conozco bastante pero me falta mucho sobre todo al resto de los equipos y los diferentes estadios
303993 mantenerme sano y salir cada d a a darle la oportunidad a mi equipo de ganar

304010 g a ve british prime minister gordon brown some management advice over the weekend
304011 this column incorrectly said that sen barack obama shared his views on how to avoid micromanagement with british prime minister gordon brown last saturday obama shared those views with british opposition leader david cameron
304012 inside according to a witness he told the house members this is the moment
304013 milbank cited the quote in support of his thesis that obama was becoming a
304014 suggest ed that obama was beginning to believe his own hype
304015 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that obama was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
304016 house democratic aides getting up thursday morning and decid ing that the quotes looked bad
304017 i do wonder whether or not echoing a misquote is really your best starting point
304018 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
304019 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
304020 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
304021 the enthusiasm is not about me at all milbank cited a comment that means nearly the opposite of the interpretation milbank gave it if the leadership aides version is accurate
304022 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
304023 it should be noted if it hasnt already that nobody is questioning the accuracy of the obama quotes only the context
304024 his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
304025 how extraordinary to sit twenty miles up the road refusing to talk with the rest of us but choosing instead to address us in print
304026 how has johns radical paradox that gods glory is most visible at moments of apparent weakness and vulnerability been part of your churchs story

304028 in all actuality you dont have be a theater hall concert hall or anything you can be a strip club that has nude dance
304029 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
304030 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
304031 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
304032 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
304033 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
304034 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
304035 but for mr kuo you would never have been involved in this
304036 she was under the control of this man i likened him to be a puppeteer
304037 this is a woman who her entire adult life has been inextricably wound up with mr kuo she has been financially dependent on him emotionally dependent on him
304038 it was all because of my relationship with mr kuo
304039 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
304040 it is an additional option to allow us to keep kids in the educational classroom
304041 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels
304042 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
304043 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
304044 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
304045 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing

304491 we are encouraged by the planned setting up of the communion partners initiative in the episcopal church as a means of sustaining those who feel at odds with developments taking place in their own province but who wish to be loyal to and to maintain their fellowship within tec and within the anglican communion

304522 are you serious theists believe atheists are going to hell their entire worldview is quite literally inflammatory being polite is nice but it doesnt mean much when youve already judged and damned your interlocutor with a theology your interlocutor knows is judging and damming him christian theistic cosmology is inherently an insult to those youre trying to save dont be surprised then if atheists respond as if youve started an inflammatory argument with them you have in the depths of your heart
304523 the people held them in high esteem and all the more believers in the lord multitudes of men and women were constantly added to their number

304534 there has been a disconnect between the doctrine of evangelism and the practice of evangelism
304535 while we passionately believe we should reach the lost we are not passionately seeking them
304536 we primarily convert only our offspring and only a small percentage of these are remaining active in the church as grownups not until the whole church again catches the evangelistic spirit will we experience growth and retain our young people
304537 no im not being cocky when i say that i put my whole heart and soul into the song i think i connect with the audience and make them feel it
304538 you have to give it all up then it will come back to you bigger than before i had not imagined all of this but fame does not give me satisfaction my faith does and it gives me hope

304543 yeah but he cant even use half of his skills it hardly counts
304544 im not going to be surprised one day that franklin breaks that record the number of goals kicked in one game that will never surprise me
304545 it doesnt really come into my head if im kicking the goals and the points are still there and were winning ive got no problem with it to be honest
304546 ive got my own natural kicking style theres not point changing it is there
304547 ive been doing my goal kicking from the start of pre season so ive just been sticking to what ive done nothings really changed at all with my goal kicking
304548 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guys who can get the footy then focus on the goal kicking
304549 from the way we look at it he is a very very dangerous forward and what its doing is opposition sides are starting to double team him and thats going to create other opportunities for forwards in the side
304550 its significant for our club that we spread the workload and share the acknowledgment right across the side when we play well
304551 hell obviously recover from that game and well make a decision again on monday
304552 if he recovers well hell play again next week if he doesnt hell have a rest for a week and hopefully play the week after
304553 he twisted awkwardly and felt a bit uncomfortable with it
304554 they would have been disappointed with their last couple weeks form as we were ourselves
304555 we knew the start of the game would really set the pattern and trend for the day and to for us to get away to a good start was really pleasing
304556 to respond the manner they did and run away with the win was really pleasing because we knew it would be a real tough contest
304557 collingwood with their backs against the wall are probably the most dangerous side in the competition
304558 to get a convincing victory like that was a real credit to how our guys carried out the game
304559 just send the bill to francois henri pinault its for the baby

304571 i think whites are spoilt for all the bad things they did to black people they ought to be a bit more grateful in fact they should count themselves lucky they were not shot on the day of liberation perhaps its not too late to hang a few whites at the local stadium just to remind them who is charge
304572 whites never stop complaining they whinge about crime they say the country is the most violent in the world well they can afford to say that for their information the violence has always been there its just that when they were in power all the crime and violence was taking place in black communities
304573 i want zuma to embark on a redistribution exercise i want him to distribute white women among the long suffering black chaps in south africa he must first choose which white woman he wants he can even have two that done he must then distribute to his loyal supporters and if there is a surplus he should distribute to his supporters in tiny neighbouring states

304597 the easiest way to separate a girl from her clothing is with a camera
304598 i do try to get the most out of my girls with braces and retainers including piss puke and throat fucking i like silly young sluts with braces i know how to make them feel good most people criticize their looks with braces but i tell them how cute they are in them i mean have you ever seen a 24 year old with braces
304599 repeated reamings piss and puke and its still there really amazing stuff i had tried the brush on high price crap and thats just useless the eye shadow and cheek makeup i use is the low cost stuff used by teens those are the only ones who have the bright pinks and blues that really pop on camera
304600 is it just foggy do you need water is it life threatening
304601 then pull your panties down and listen lets get one thing straight theres only one guy who calls cut on the set and thats me
304602 piss soaked cum splattered soil soaked puke stained slime covered ass blasted fender flapping sponge stupid shitfucks
304603 a total fuck pig that puked on my cock several times and kept on going
304604 in the early scenes i could have talked this whore into sucking my dogs dick but she learned the fateful word no later on
304605 anything and i mean anything was the way i had this slut processed not a typical porn girl just a total slut
304606 at the beginning anything would be possible but she got to be an uppity fat fuck shortly afterwards
304607 any thing is possible with this whore including licking donkey balls
304608 the only problem i had with this whore is she spoke very little english nowadays i just would just start pissing down her throat and im sure she would take it
304609 she would pretty much do whatever i wanted at the time including fisting but then let a little success go to her head and wouldnt speak to me for years
304610 she guzzles piss with the best of them and i even taught her how to fist herself
304611 pour it into a whores asshole then plunge your cock in and have it spill out down the whores thighs and cunt nice and messy then get another slut to suck and lick the rest of the milkshake out of the sluts asspipe and do some spit swapping between the two fucktoys hope these suggestions are of some use
304612 seven years ago a scene consisted of seven minutes a couple of positions and the pop shot nowadays the scenes are longer and people expect more intense work im compared to rocco siffredi intensity is what the public demands of us
304613 its pretty easy to get a slut to spread solo for the camera
304614 and quite a different matter to get her to take it up the ass and puke up piss
304615 the thing which offended the police so much was the relatively subtle underage sex fantasy no one is declared to be underage and it is a relatively minor theme but that just got the lapd incensed so that was the thrust of the prosecutions case a film with the implication that there are underage characters thats what they want to be determined to be obscene
304616 were going to continue to produce our movies using girls that are young fresh and excited its never my intention to lead a viewer to believe that a girl is underage what we try to do is to portray a young ladys innocence to the experience of sex for the first time my experience has been that a lot of the girls we work with enjoy role playing and acting as if its the first time for them
304617 i consider this event equal to if not more important than anything i have done over all these years

304626 im still not sure where i am with her yknow i mean she asked me out but shes just it seems like we make some headway and i start thinking that were a couple but then she backs off and i dont hear from her for days or even sometimes a week or more trying to figure out what im doing wrong
304627 i mean shes i see something in her like just under the surface and im willing to wait for that i just dont know how long ill have to or anything
304628 im i dunno just kinda letting her do the leading
304629 i love it when she smiles she doesnt really do it often but when she does she just lights up and man i swear my heart just about jumps out of my chest its like christmas or something every time
304630 ill save that for you still owe you for that stunt you pulled with the canners
304631 theres a big difference between sticking one lobster in someones face and dropping ten of them ten onto someone in the shower
304632 small mercy my shins were bruised for a week from where i dove out of the shower tore down the curtain got water everywhere
304633 well im glad i provide such a source of amusement

304642 decisions based on objective criteria alone are at least as effective as those influenced by subjective impressions formed in an interview
304643 the human understanding supposes a greater degree of order and equality in things than it really finds and although many things in nature be sui generis and most irregular will yet invest parallels and conjugates and relatives where no such thing is
304644 all superstition is much the same whether it be that of astrology dreams omens retributive judgment or the like in that the deluded believers observe events which are fulfilled but neglect or pass over their failure though it be much more common

304658 strong and vocal stands in favor of impeaching president bush and vice president cheney
304659 in the eyes of the right wing i am seen a
304660 i think the republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda
304661 you know who wanted us to impeach the president it was the republicans
304662 impeachment would suck all of the oxygen out of the room
304663 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing

304665 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred

304671 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
304672 so what i want to do is just to make sure that we are putting together the kind of comprehensive plan that is going to work and if you have a package that is offshore drilling only which is essentially what bush and mccain have been emphasizing then i think that that is not going to solve the problem and i would be opposed to that
304673 and when i am president i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts thats how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good

304710 rises the eternal heavenly joy that eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath ever risen in the heart of man as st paul says but when a man here on earth is illumined by the holy spirit from the spring of jesus christ there enters into his heart and into all his veins such joy that the whole body trembles and the animal spirit triumphs as though it were in the holy trinity which they alone understand who have been its guests
304711 i know not why but my heart was so filled with joy that i could do nothing but sing and preach
304712 we live in great joy which possess nothing joy is our food as it is with the radiant gods
304713 they experience supreme indescribable blessedness as they say this is that i e as they identify themselves with the atman 118 at times even the very absolute is felt as abundance and fullness of joy brahman is joy or rapture
304714 for out of joy these creatures spring by joy they live after their birth and into joy they return when they depart hence
304715 thinking of me and surrendering their life to me they find in me their peace and joy
304716 thou hast held as a sacred shrine my empty worthless mind thou hast given me rapturous joy that knows no bounds
304717 joy for ever no sorrow no struggle there have i seen joy filled to the brim perfection of joy
304718 old things are passed away behold all things are become new

304721 he is made worthy to look upon the revelation of great mysteries
304722 and wherever i turned my eyes he said to me behold that have i created and i felt an inexpressible sweetness
304723 the eyes of my soul were opened for a moment and i saw the fullness of god in which i saw the whole world
304724 open the eyes of love and behold him that pervadeth the whole world consider it well and know that this is your own country i see with eyes open and smile and behold his beauty everywhere i utter his name and whatever i see it reminds me of him whatever i do it becomes his worship
304725 the whole world proclaimeth to me that in it is no place small even as a grain of mustard seed which is not full of thee
304726 i opened my eyes and through the radiance of his countenance around me in everything that my eye perceived i saw only god
304727 danceth and the twitching of my limbs is like the hand clapping of a singer and my spirit is the musician
304728 from the right hand and from the left soundeth the voice of love
304729 aspect of the divine it becomes pantheistically illumined affirmed and glorified
304730 i am crucified with christ yet not i but christ liveth in me
304731 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ
304732 i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation
304733 who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh
304734 i am with you always even unto the end of the world
304735 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
304736 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
304737 know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
304738 and the time will come the kingdom of corruption death and sin will end and then will come the complete revelation of glory the fullness of eternal life death will be

304796 were excited to have patrick and demareo in the ole miss family
304797 not only are they good athletes they are good people im really impressed with the players and coaches in the mississippi junior college system
304798 sure id like to beat notre dame dont get me wrong but nothing matters more than beating that cow college on the other side of the state
304799 the expectation level is high at the university of alabama and it should be whats wrong with people expecting excellence
304800 in the past we were always using a tight end and very little four wideouts greg handled all of that tony walked in here and put in his package and he felt like paying attention to detail at each position he wanted one coach for two positions
304801 he felt like we would get more reps that way and get things corrected better that way he gave me the y tight end position and the inside receiver position there are more eyes on them they are getting more reps and there is more correction going on hopefully it will make us better
304802 obviously watching the bowl game our tight end position can now be attached to the formation like it has been in the past or we can stand them up and move them outside
304803 tommy trott right now is our starting tight end backed up by gabe we always want to have a smaller tight end as a receiver which is tim hawthorne who has a big body hes a bigger body that is more athletic and a little more fluid running down the field and can stretch the field on third downs
304804 right now it lines up with those three at that position with our other tight ends vying for that fourth spot well still use a two tight end set we ran almost 30 plays out of that formation in the bowl game were not going to get away from that well take our other tight ends in brent slusher and bailey woods and vance smith and hopefully they can fill a void for us as back ups
304805 we felt like he had an outstanding bowl game and an outstanding spring you could tell when he was there during scrimmages he made things happen hes a dynamic player we think we have to get him the football well get some screens to him he can stretch the field vertically he catches the ball very well were excited about him
304806 terrell zachery in my opinion from an inside receiver position and maybe on the whole offense was the most improved player ive seen
304807 he had a great spring and has had a great summer his attitude and his work ethic have improved not only on the field but in the weight room and in the classroom im very proud of him
304808 he has to play well for us and i believe he will hopefully well run 70 or 80 plays and he needs to get 30 of them or better behind them we have john cubelic who went through the spring with us hes very capable and understands this offense freshman darvin adams will round out that h position
304809 what were doing right now we have the terminology to move our inside receivers outside and our outside receivers inside
304810 were trying to create mismatches going into two a days theyre going to have to know every position basically
304811 number two i believe coming out of spring our three deep basically understands the offense
304812 were going to put very few routes in on one day well probably put three or four concepts in and see how many reps we can get from it the next day well add another concept its just a matter of mastering the technique of each route and each concept hopefully through the reps well get that done

304865 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
304866 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
304867 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
304868 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
304869 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack

304888 im not convinced i know the source of the contamination
304889 the message here from a scientific and policy standpoint is profound
304890 facilities that are medical and microbiological may not be suitably equipped for dealing with aerosolized versions of the organisms that they otherwise deal with in great safety these facilities probably ought not be located in a heavily populated area how do you contain smoke

304901 theres nothing to fear from globalism free trade and a single worldwide currency the effort in recent decades to unify government surveillance over all world trade and international financial transactions through the un imf world bank wto icc the oecd and the bank of international settlements can never substitute for a peaceful world based on true free trade freedom of movement a single but sound market currency and voluntary contracts with private property rights the ultimate solution will only come with the rejection of fiat money worldwide and a restoration of commodity money commodity money if voluntarily and universally accepted could give us a single world currency requiring no money managers no manipulators orchestrating a man made business cycle with rampant price inflation

304907 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
304908 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
304909 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
304910 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
304911 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
304912 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
304913 if you try to take my guns i will shoot you dead
304914 will you fire upon civilians if ordered to do so

304932 even if theres the language barrier it doesnt make any difference you still learn from each other
304933 i love it it was very enjoyable the people are great the food i really enjoyed
304934 were hoping people come out on saturday and take the initiative to become responsible adults parents and children
304935 it really is just a group of individuals and community groups that came together knowing that violence was out of hand
304936 we are going to make people aware and help them step up in creating and maintaining a violence free community
304937 going to go blank get confused and just stand there
304938 the figure itself had a rather sad and worried expression a strange shaped head so the masks of the various heroes would better stay in place over it and a more detailed musculature than g i joes
304939 we are totally against the killing of aid workers and call upon all somali people to embrace peace
304940 the somali civil society and media were equally hard hit with killings of a well known peace activist in beletweyne and a journalist in kismayo
304941 unfortunately july started off on an equally sad note with the killing of a senior un staff member in mogadishu on 6 july
304942 and everything must be done to ensure they come to an end
304943 the government position is that it does not condone the killing or kidnapping of those who are trying to help the somali people
304944 the problem is not with the procedure but the way it is abused by men so that men think they are now immune from hiv contagion
304945 men say ive been circumcised i dont have to wear a condom they get infected and they give us hiv
304946 he my husband was circumcised and felt he didnt have to wear a condom when we found we had hiv after testing he blamed me he said you brought hiv into this house it was because i tested first when i was pregnant with my second child
304947 my husband did not believe he could be hiv positive because he was circumcised i did all i could to convince him to test and he finally did that was the end he took another wife and left us
304948 people think the disease originates with women why because it is the women who are tested first when they are about to give birth
304949 families blame women when hiv comes into the house and it results in all sorts of abuse from physical abuse to denial of spousal and child support and loss of property rights
304950 introducing the procedure there was insufficient attention given to cultural factors attitudes and human psychology
304951 many of the men i speak with think circumcision is like an aids vaccine its not its a useful tool to reduce chances of infection at a time and place where few other tools are available but you can still contract hiv and pass it onto a partner
304952 this aids is bad nobody admits they are hiv positive but so many people are dying i dont want to give up sex so i am getting circumcised
304953 it is painful to get circumcised if i have to wear a condom anyway what is the point
304954 the problem with male circumcision is not the procedure but communications
304955 we always end up against mens stubborn dislike of condoms
304956 i feel like i have no purpose like there is no meaning to it
304957 i have no idea who the childs father is i have to struggle just to get clothes for us i beg to eat
304958 of all the countries i have studied by far the most dramatic suicide rate was in sierra leone
304959 its not just the orphans who are at risk because many children who did not lose their parents are living in environments where they are abused or which are violent in some way
304960 the main difference for the orphans is that they generally have less self esteem lower social skills and more depression there are more signs of post traumatic stress disorder more bedwetting and conduct problems
304961 the girls prostitute themselves to survive some do it to pay their school fees
304962 people have lost their cultural values and their sense of community
304963 families just cant cope with taking in another child they want to focus on their own and themselves
304964 it is good to free people to decongest the prisons but we deplore the fact that the measure is marred by discrimination
304965 the peace agreement has failed to silence the guns and the people of eastern congo continue to suffer and to run for their lives
304966 the parties to the agreement must urgently redouble their efforts to act on the commitments they made to protect civilians
304967 one of the women officers scraped his knuckles with a razor like object later the man a police officer tied him to a machine that stretched his arms
304968 the abduction and torture of a ugandan hiv aids activist who faces trial for holding a peaceful protest reveals the danger to those who challenge the governments policies
304969 ugandas government promotes homophobia when it should be protecting its citizens against hiv aids
304970 there is nothing to show the person in question was tortured by our officers

304974 we have no idea what blind people go through but theres little they cant do
304975 follow the crowd thats what a lot of us do
304976 we dont tend to take the lead unless were very sure were good crowd followers literally
304977 its something that i think were going to have to advocate to car lots that sell them to be sure theres notices put in these things
304978 by law they cannot refuse a guide dog in their taxi
304979 i was at the point of my life where i was looking forward to my drivers licence
304980 i was into sports i loved hockey it was a bummer but oh well its been 10 years now
304981 i sprained an ankle a couple of times getting off the bus
304982 i think down south they mark the pavement yellow just where the bus stops are to let you know where they are its very hard to see the sign it doesnt stand out at all
304983 ive been running the same route for years and years even before i lost my eyesight
304984 a lot of these audible signals seniors do like them because it gives them an opportunity to get across these places with some safety
304985 so its not just the visually impaired and blind who are benefitting even though we are the ones who push it and pursue it
304986 if thats the case then thats where we need to do a bit of advocating for longer signals
304987 if you were to set your foot off the curb and start walking right at the point where it changes from walk to dont walk the dont walk would flash for enough time for the average person to walk across in safety
304988 for the people who need extra time theyve got the average persons walking speed plus the first seven seconds of walk
304989 audible signals are only there to go on during the time the walk arrow is on
304990 the timing of the walk indication and the dont walk thats established using provincial guidelines
304991 when the walk signal comes up it will actually vibrate so that even those who dont see or hear can still know when its safe to start crossing
304992 it does cost money but were arguing for it whenever we can we want to make sure the city is accessible as we can make it
304993 prince george has come along slowly i guess as well as any other community
304994 im also a taxpayer so i understand the other side of that issue you cant go out and get everything today because it costs millions of dollars
304995 weve got a long way to go and were aware of that
304996 we have hydro poles to contend with very expensive things to move but we do have the benefit of a 250 000 sidewalk rehab budget that were using to do what we can to address these accessibility issues
304997 we try to minimize the diversions because thats not good for the visually impaired either
304998 if theyre trying to walk a straight line and we keep putting jogs in the sidewalk thats not going to help either every project is a judgment call
304999 back then wheelchair mobility wasnt an issue but now it is and theyve had to since cut down the angles
305000 the old sidewalk used to be about 1 5 metres asphalt which can get bumpy as it deteriorates and weve changed that to 1 8 metres concrete which is a much stronger design and its wider
305001 the problem is all the wheelchair ramps end up being at 45 degrees to the intersection which doesnt help the visually impaired so what weve got is a series of tactile grooves that are carved into all the wheelchair ramps such that the visually impaired can put their cane in the groove and align themselves with the crosswalk
305002 weve had calls from vancouver and edmonton on our design so its little city making good

305019 if you look at ism and the unemployment number together it suggests an economy that is at best stuck in neutral
305020 but we are forecasting continued growth in the economy for the back half of the year and it will be that growth that will determine a return to job creation
305021 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
305022 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
305023 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
305024 i think that what the american people really want is a person of faith who shares their values

305034 reaffirming human rights for all the universal declaration at 60
305035 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
305036 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
305037 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
305038 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
305039 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

305042 the figures on the low number of investigations and the minute number of indictments filed reveal that the army is shirking its duty to protect the civilian palestinian population from offenses committed by its soldiers

305057 we are talking about avoidable blindness more than 80 percent of blindness is preventable it is the right of people who are blind to have access to services
305058 via cameroon well give the people of central africa and the blind that have no hope every reason to be hopeful we shall be introducing social protection mechanisms
305059 the timely gift will enhance the work of the two blind prevention centres we have in the province these two centres take care of the six divisions that make the province we also reinforce our fight against blindness through regular campaigns in the field and the distribution of mectizan drugs with the new equipments now available we will be able to reach out to the hinterlands and fish out the people with eye problems and bring them closer to the treatment table

305062 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
305063 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen

305065 so far we are ok for labor but when we start on the bigger infrastructure projects then its possible that it will be much more difficult to get enough workers
305066 at ibm they have a saying whatever people tell you its all about money in the end and with money we can solve even this
305067 this problem is greater than any other facing us over the next 10 years
305068 starting from this year we are seeing the number of people of working age start to go down
305069 this is a colossal task because russia has never had to deal with it before
305070 in reality the putin era policies were for the most part a step backward so that hasnt given much cause for hope
305071 but its still too early to draw any conclusions so far its only been words and they still have to really do something
305072 if youd asked me 10 years ago i would have said we could solve this by now but now i am not so sure
305073 it is already being felt fully and in a lot of sectors
305074 the problem of the labor famine can only solved by the government and business working together
305075 there are issues at every level of the labor market but in russia the biggest problem is with managerial talent at the top
305076 if you look at china then russias management training is 10 to 15 years behind them
305077 this is certainly peak season for hiring and retaining people
305078 it is not uncommon for top managers to be poached with significant salary increases this compounds the problem of rising salary costs in an inflationary market
305079 employers continue to face significantly rising cost pressure on wages
305080 we need a new generation of specialists if we are going to develop the competitiveness of domestic industry and create promising military and civilian production models
305081 i read recently that the number of candidates for universities is only just equal to the number of places on offer now
305082 so imagine what the situation for business will be a few years time
305083 you may think that handing out european standard diplomas is a stimulus for our citizens finding jobs abroad
305084 but rather than introduce limits we need to create the best conditions for keeping our youth working in russia thats raising wages and living conditions
305085 this suggests that the long term impact on the current and critically future work force could be very significant
305086 over the past 10 years the tendency has been for foreign companies to phase out expatriates since their main purpose is to transfer professional skills to local employees over a limited period of say a three to five year assignment
305087 talk of a work force deficit is at the very least premature
305088 on the one hand the government is pushing to develop small business but on the other bureaucrats demands seriously limit the mobility of small businesses
305089 there is no work back home and the pay is very small
305090 who knows how long well be here maybe another year on this site and then well move on to another building
305091 the constant restrictions in legalizing migration labor lead to more illegal workers on sites
305092 even the biggest well known companies take the risks and use illegal workers on their constriction sites
305093 this year russia has about 1 million illegal workers on its sites
305094 the construction boom has just started in coming years the number will only increase
305095 you need to let the third world in because you have a worker shortage
305096 henceforth no jew no matter under what name will be allowed to remain here without my written permission i know of no other troublesome pest within the state than this race which impoverished the people by their fraud usury and money lending and commits all deeds which an honorable man despises subsequently they have to be removed and excluded from here as much as possible
305097 airporters that do the circuit between their cities santa cruz marin county etc and the sfo and sjc or oakland airports
305098 and since even the jews feelings are limited to the purely material realm his thoughts and ambitions are bound to be so even more strongly
305099 henceforth no jew no matter under what name will be allowed to remain here without my written permission i know of no other troublesome pest within the state than this race which impoverished the people by their fraud usury and money lending and commits all deeds which an honorable man despises subsequently they have to be removed and excluded from here as much as possible
305100 giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys
305101 welcome back that sounds very interesting when was it published
305102 what we do claim is that the northern european and particularly anglo saxons made this country oh yes the others helped they added to it they often enriched it but they did not make it and they have not yet greatly changed it and what we assert is that we are not going to surrender it to somebody else or allow other people no matter what their merits to make it something different
305103 the policy provides a better coordination mechanism that will benefit all stakeholders and will guide ngos in identifying areas of the country where their services are most needed to avoid the clustering of ngos in one part of the country leaving the vast majority of the country in need of services
305104 whereas the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of nigeria particularly chapter 4 and section 39 guarantees the right to freedom of expression it is therefore not in the interest of national development to be fighting those who calls for the civil defence to be carrying arms on the pages of newspapers
305105 the vision to combat crime and the mission thereof remains everybodys business since the nscdc has succeeded so tremendously unarmed it signifies that if armed it will be the antidote others could not offer in combating crime
305106 nscdc is a well organised paramilitary organisation well trained a high sense of discipline and proper orientation we believe that if armed will exhibit an exemplary and combatant arm squad
305107 this is another fraud of the century because it has been confirmed that the governors of the 19 northern states banks and individuals contributed n3 6 billion to organize the summit
305108 this is an amount large enough to take care of a large number of the poverty stricken people of the north
305109 clearly this is an agenda of some self styled leaders of the north to further enrich themselves to the detriment of the less privileged
305110 the coalition is aware that this is not the first summit on agriculture in the north
305111 it is no longer news that the north is the most backward area of the country instead of our leaders to channel their resources towards correcting this imbalance they indulge in wasteful expenditures organizing summits that do not yield any results
305112 the governors have organized series of education summits but the north remains backward in the education
305113 the coalition believes that there is a deliberate policy on the part of the governors to perpetually suppress the ordinary people by refusing to empower them for life through education
305114 this may not be strange though given the fact that some of our leaders in the north find it difficult to do away with feudal tendencies which they inherit from their forebears
305115 we hereby condemn the so called northern agricultural summit through which the governors have again siphoned so much money public funds using their cronies and accomplices
305116 it is strange that the governors can descend so low to make such irrational statement knowing the contribution of oil wealth to the north in particular and the nation at large
305117 the policy is leaving out girls and is a big threat to efforts of reducing the gender gap we need to take action before it is late
305118 there is a long term exhaustion and diminished interest of young women taking on the fight they think it is battle for old women
305119 many young women and girls grew up with that obvious consciousness of being emancipated nowadays this young generation does not find it necessary to be active and show solidarity
305120 the children have to learn about the value of a woman in society especially an educated woman

305126 a careful study of anti semitism prejudice and accusations might be of great value to many jews who do not adequately realize the irritations they inflict
305127 the most important mitigating factor is that miraculously none of your victims have tested positive
305128 im sorry for what i did i have taken many wrong choices in my life
305129 he had difficulty reconciling in his mind that he would be hiv positive for the rest of his life and he had difficulty understanding what that meant

305131 the writers only responsibility is to his art he will be completely ruthless if he is a good one he has a dream it anguishes him so much he must get rid of it he has no peace until then

305139 what is this programme when government doesnt have a clear measurement
305140 one would have expected the lekgotla to embark on this process postponing issues on the poor is a problem because it shows that there is no urgency
305141 on the poverty line there was internal disagreement within government
305142 we had two views one from the treasury and one from social development the government promised to come back last month but we are still waiting
305143 i think they the government didnt get the response they wanted on the strategy now they wont engage in a formal process
305144 the fact is they said we needed a strategy so they must produce one the devil is in the detail
305145 i probably shouldnt have thrown anything but i dont think i got what i deserved
305146 they got me i tried getting at them but they took me from every which angle
305147 we obviously take the charges very seriously we just got a copy of the criminal complaint we have to begin to do our own investigation on the matter to see what really happened and we look forward to dealing with the charges in a serious way
305148 they cant be coming over here and starting stuff with brewers fans and thinking they can get away with it they need to get a good amount of time i agree with substantial battery definitely
305149 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
305150 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt

305343 love is divine i feel it is unnecessary to ask me with who i am in love when it is necessary i will reveal it myself
305344 when there are so many problems in the country like the hike in the petrol price and government problems it is not warranted to publish exclusives that i am in love with this actress and that actress i promise that i will reveal the news of my love when it really happens
305345 there is news that another popular actor who could not digest my victory is spreading such kind of rumors i dont know how far this is true but i am not worried even if he has done so i never try to get cheap publicity like this

305375 our moral obligations to patients who exist in what has come to be called a persistent vegetative state
305376 m y father has judged that the burden of persisting in a vegetative state far outweighs the benefit of being sustained that way this in my view is a very catholic way of thinking
305377 that claim has no foundation in the text and is actually contradicted

305393 most important perhaps there isnt any reason to ban space warfare the 1967 treaty concerned nuclear weapons whose effects are so horrific that it made sense to keep them on terra firma where they can be watched over more carefully but space weapons even when they arent actually reducing the threat from icbms are no more destructive of human life than earth based weapons why should this one particular theater be made weapon free

305410 amnesty international today welcomed the unblocking of its website in the olympics media venues and reportedly in other parts of beijing but it insisted that the promise of complete media freedom in china during the olympics has still not been honoured and that the ioc and world leaders should press for an end to internet censorship in china

305414 next week come the games themselves so lavish so decorated with trappings of chinas new power so prefaced with human dwarfing ceremonies of mass power that we will be awoken sharply to a rising might that will soon dominate our century in the meantime we have the weasels of the ioc showing this week how institutions we trust to spread western values to a totalitarian regime may in fact help instead to spread totalitarian values to the west

305436 when a country is in its early stages of development as china was 20 years ago having an export processing center is good for growth
305437 basically the cost of things china produces for home depot and wal mart are going up
305438 but there is another side in some areas that chinas going to grab like telecom equipment theyll push prices lower
305439 dragons at your door how chinese cost innovation is disrupting global competition
305440 they have a lot of technology locked up in the military and now the government is reducing budgets and pressing agencies to privatize so suddenly a lot of technology people thought didnt exist has come out from behind the curtain
305441 our strategy in china is to always focus on innovation
305442 were now in the domestic market but well spare no effort to grab overseas expansion
305443 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination

305449 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
305450 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
305451 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
305452 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
305453 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past
305454 average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0 75 percent at election day moreover cumulative u s military fatalities in iraq will reach 4 300 or more
305455 given those fundamental conditions the bread and peace model predicts a republican two party vote share centered on 48 2 percent

305459 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
305460 i think its really a lack of focus and attention by the federal government
305461 and i think the department of defense bares a special responsibility and my legislations designed to see them discharge it to make sure that those votes count
305462 this is something that if most americans knew existed the current dismal state of actual opportunity to see your vote count for our men and women in uniform they would be up in arms
305463 i think we have a significant responsibility to encourage our men and women in uniform to vote and to enable them to vote and so this is a high priority and your question prompts me to go find out if things are on track as i have been told they are in terms of making sure that we have the ballots and things available for our for our troops

305475 static transmissions from a distant dark star taking up and tripping out further than the velvet undergrounds black angel death song mars punished not with blunt force but with a propulsive agitation which signaled a neurological insanity a crippled tension swathed in nervous friction a cavernous musical universe riddled with eerie sound storms whose poisoned atmosphere seduced and threatened obtuse and unforgiving sickly sexy red noise redefining bass urges forcing the listener to question their own sanity by drilling into ear holes using electroshock guitars as saw blades trepanning into grey matter mars unleashed a choking cacophony illustrating the body as machine in disrepair fuelled by the impending repulsion and disintegration of a perverse romance with ones own demons demons who once wrenched free made mimicry of the jangling nerve centers and given voice as song turned schizophrenic and howled these testimonials to the unbearable

305487 if you are elected and you learned that the government new aliens had visited earth and the public didnt know would you ensure the public found out
305488 well it depends on what these aliens were like and whether they were democrats or republicans

305490 there is no constitutional requirement for a president to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
305491 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
305492 but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
305493 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
305494 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
305495 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct
305496 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

305508 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons

305549 pressurised recovery has been around for the past 30 years but this is the deepest fish capture under pressure the previous record was 1 400m this is also the first time pressurised capture has occurred at a hydrothermal vent
305550 at depths of over 1 000m it is difficult to recover animals alive catching with no pressure is as good as catching dead fish are the most fragile even a fisherman with a 100m line will probably reel in a catch whose gas bladder is in its mouth
305551 we were at least 100 metres offshore when all of a sudden a wave went over us and this huge thing leapt into the boat
305552 we managed to whack it away with our oars and it went back into the sea only to come back for a second time
305553 it was more than a metre long and looked like a baby shark we kept whacking it and finally managed to get it back into the sea
305554 when we were sure it was dead we hauled it back into the dinghy got it back to the beach and took a picture of it
305555 i thought they were having me on when they told me about the incident but when i saw how flustered luke was i realised it was true
305556 i spent a lot of time in dinghies when i was younger but never experienced anything like this
305557 these are not big sharks and they only go for prey that know they can tackle they are non agressive and would swim away if they came across anyone in the sea
305558 i have never known anyone to be bitten by a starry smoothound
305559 a dinghy would be too big for the shark and it would simply swim away from such a large threat it only has a small jaw so would be difficult for it to bite the dinghy
305560 the reason for it being near the surface might have been because it was sick or injured
305561 the feedback that im receiving on the door is that theres almost an acknowledgement that the clp cant win but most people that im talking to would like to see an effective opposition and some more numbers on the country liberals side of parliament at least to hold the government a bit more to account

305567 the ban on seal products by the european union is about the way in which the animals are harvested i admit we are not perfect and there is room for improvement in the manner in which the animals are culled
305568 the cullers are expected to club the animal and then immediately pierce the heart

305582 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
305583 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
305584 the scientific community is really going to run with this
305585 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

305642 congresswoman herseth sandlin and congressman shimkus have consistently demonstrated their leadership in advancing the use of both ethanol and biodiesel the nevc would like to express our sincere appreciation for this recent action
305643 our automaker members have pledged to produce 50 percent of their total vehicle production as flexible fuel by 2012 if the infrastructure is available to support such vehicles even though we now have 1 650 e85 fueling locations this still represents less than 1 of the total gasoline fueling stations we are convinced that if this proposal were adopted the nation would have no less than 10 000 e85 fueling sites in a short period of time
305644 we are excited to see ford moving forward with their commitment to adding more ffvs to their line up
305645 the auto industry is experiencing significant shifts in product demand to high mileage vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles which do not solely operate on petroleum we believe that the use of e85 and other high level blends of ethanol in these ffvs can have a significant impact to reducing demand for imported petroleum

305661 source port randomization to improve resilience against dns cache poisoning attacks
305662 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the internet protocol weakness
305663 we know with microsoft that there were a few problems even installing their dns patch
305664 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
305665 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
305666 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already
305667 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do all right but the key is to plan ahead

305685 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
305686 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
305687 i hit a pole probably going about 35 mph it just jumped right out in front of me
305688 i just woke up at wachovia went to the range actually past the range and went straight to the first tee because i wanted to hit off in front of nathan green because hes a really slow player

305752 this is a big deal when you think about the magnitude of this because it is the first time flight medics have received the cmb it is an interesting point in history
305753 in the past the combat medical badge was only awarded to those medics serving with ground units for one reason or another flight medics were unable to qualify for the badge
305754 they are willing to go anywhere anytime to do the hard work and its just impressive
305755 when they get the call they dont know what they are getting into all they know is that they are going to save a soldiers life or any human being for that matter these guys are truly angels of mercy
305756 it is sort of a thankless job most people think all we do is pick up and drop off patients and only give us credit for that we dont get credit for the times when we retrieve patients under fire or treat them while in flight
305757 so these 7 people are the first and i very happy to be here to see the duty first bde 1st inf div be the first to award the combat medic badge to air medevac medics
305758 we designed the ip master trainer program to try to get the biggest impact from a small element of u s soldiers
305759 we hand picked ip who displayed leadership potential at their stations and brought them in for training
305760 these guys have come a long way since the beginning and they are using what we have taught them
305761 in the beginning they would run disorganized into a room to clear it now the last day of training they are going into the room in a stack
305762 overall this group of ip has made a dramatic improvement in their capabilities
305763 the compact water treatment unit was originally built by the army corps of engineers
305764 the day it opened in june 2007 terrorists blew up the school next to it causing severe damage to the cwtu
305765 more than 12 000 people were not receiving water because of a war that was going on around them
305766 we have such a tight knit community here in santa clara county
305767 even if greg or i have insurance we still stand next to someone who has to think can i afford this before going to the doctor when theyre sick and that is a danger to all of us

305773 now i am light now i fly now i see myself beneath myself now a god dances through me
305774 love can be seen as the answer but nobody bleeds for the dancer
305775 we come into this world singing our hearts out encapsulated and held by the sonorous envelope of the mothers voice who sings with us in intimate exclusivity then along comes language and as we enter into its code something vital is lost that we spend a lifetime trying to reclaim it is this lost world of the emotive song the call of the instinct the cry of the heart that we must excavate from the depths
305776 whoah i just saw something moving there out of the corner of my eye
305777 what do you want to hear what do you want to see
305778 heck what are the odds of that shit happening again even james had only seen it once

305788 therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance god is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom he has appointed having furnished proof to all men by raising him from the dead

305794 hands are tied there is nothing they can do with regard to this
305795 there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes
305796 the economy is limping along right around zero slightly positive

305800 we have gone forth from our shores repeatedly over the last hundred years and weve done this as recently as the last year in afghanistan and put wonderful young men and women at risk many of whom have lost their lives and we have asked for nothing except enough ground to bury them in and otherwise we have returned home to seek our own you know to seek our own lives in peace to live our own lives in peace

305802 what do you mean marriage troubles psht were fine see were fine
305803 i like both of their academics and how both of the campuses are set up
305804 i like how all the coaches were involved in the camps you didnt just see the head coach for 10 seconds like i did at uconn and then hed be gone the head coaches were out there and interacting with all the kids
305805 they want to compare me to the other receivers theyve been looking at or theyve offered
305806 they told me to be patient but i feel real good about both of those schools
305807 when they see me walking around with all these letters
305808 wed love to have more exclusive hits on our box absolutely are we investing in that yes we are does that take a lot of time yes it does
305809 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
305810 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows you
305811 the gameplay style in europe is more casual more collaborative and social
305812 theyre a key part of us getting the next 20 million on the service were asking how we become something thats relevant to everyone i think europe is the north star the sign that says heres what it looks like to broaden the service to everyone
305813 because of the amount of stuff thats coming into live its actually a little difficult for people to find it especially people outside the core users
305814 its based on this idea that you know exactly what you want to do hit the eject button put the disc in go to multiplayer and start playing your halo match thats the way its always worked that worked super well for the cognoscenti of the console world but the truth is that theres an amazing amount of content that for a lot of people is hard to find
305815 the idea is to move toward this channel metaphor so you can see at a glance the types of things that i can do on my box to make these things much more relevant about me
305816 today if youre playing halo and i say hey lets play uno its a case of right ill set up the session and ill invite you in theres a whole bunch of steps and im wondering whats going to happen where hes gone for new people thats difficult so what if the party leader selects the new experience and we all go there together no loss of communication no loss of us being together and social
305817 the community channel will be filled with animated avatars that are all saying come on over im playing this press one button and you can party up and get into their experience or start that conversation
305818 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
305819 for only a few pounds a month xbox live gold members already get access to the best online gaming network in the industry the ability to play and watch countless demos and trailers before the rest of the gaming community and video chat and messaging

305821 but i would be dishonest if i told you that i wholeheartedly embraced what i saw in lakeland something disturbed me but i kept my mouth shut for three weeks while i prayed got counsel from respected ministry leaders and searched my heart to make sure i was not harboring a religious spirit
305822 unless these initiatory events jesus exalted word preached repentance occurring of the christian life occur along with the sanctifying work of the spirit that leads to a holy life then the miracles crowds and enthusiasm will quickly wane
305823 when i wrote an article in mid may calling for scrutiny of some aspects of the lakeland revival i was labeled a pharisee and a
305824 i refuse to go on the defensive and if i need to retract any statement ive ever made about this revival i will but what these nasty exchanges have shown me is that a divisive spirit is certainly at work in our midst and we need urgent prayer to short circuit what the devil wants to do
305825 so much of what is passed off as prophecy today resembles what you might find in a daily horoscope
305826 he stated the obvious that most of those he sees come forward really arent being healed and that todd and his team need to be much more guarded in how they approach these folks and stop all the hype
305827 truth is there are very few people being healed in lakeland
305828 friday night todd said that god said there were 1000 people that were to give 1000 and they were to receive a 1000 fold blessing the one hour drama on this giving subject was so deceptively evident that it was embarrasing to watch on top of that those that would give that money were able to come to the platform to be recognized
305829 but he cannot go on embellishing speaking untruths hyping manipulating shoving kicking slapping leg dropping and bamming his way on the pulpit without consequences god will not be mocked and todd and others must answer to him for everyone led astray
305830 the biggest thing about lakeland is the lack of the fear of our awesome god lack of repentance and humility many have exchanged the truth for a lie and chosen experience over content angels trances and 3rd heaven focus has replaced the gospel as a focus lord do what only you can do to bring your divine alignment to all of us in jesus name
305831 there are some pretty obvious and wild exaggerations of resurrections healings the significance of the meetings and the overall results of todds ministry hype undermines todds credibility but also the credibility of all who believe in the power of god the power of the holy spirit needs no embellishment our exaggerations may be fooling immature christians but they are not fooling the media or the public
305832 i john kilpatrick went down to todd bentleys meetings the florida outpouring and gave my blessing to revival i made it clear that i didnt know todd his doctrinal belief nor who he is affiliated with if anyone to me doctrine is very important it always has been and it always will be it is the infrastructure that a move of god runs on you can not separate a man from his doctrine
305833 if you go back and view the earlier meetings which are archived on the god tv website you can feel the difference in the atmosphere compared to what is happening today
305834 as for taking the ark and moving somewhere else if last weekend in los angeles is an example of what to expect i am afraid this revival has been killed before it got out of the starting gate los angeles was just another conference
305835 no they want you to take the apples they would just all go to waste anyway

305837 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
305838 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
305839 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
305840 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
305841 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
305842 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
305843 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
305844 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
305845 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
305846 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
305847 someone had an entire infrastructure built to attack googles click fraud system thats a significant amount of code
305848 weve been able to come up with a java applet that for all intents and purposes is an image
305849 the attack is going to work best wherever you leave yourself logged in for long periods of time
305850 there will be other ways to do this with other technologies
305851 in the long term web applications are going to have to take control of the content
305852 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector
305853 its that browser security is broken browser security is really an oxymoron
305854 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
305855 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
305856 due to circumstances beyond my control i regret that i will not be able to participate in black hat this year

305861 when he woke up he looked at his hands and went very good
305862 already the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining
305863 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off

305951 in new york city the nations largest water provider has for the past three years assured its 9 3 million customers that its water was safe because the lead content fell below federal limits but the city has withheld from regulators hundreds of test results that would have raised lead levels above the safety standard in two of those years
305952 widespread fraud and manipulation its time to reconsider whether water utilities can be trusted with this crucial responsibility of protecting the public i fear for the safety of our nations drinking water apparently its a real crap shoot as to whats going to come out of the tap and whether it will be healthy or not

305979 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
305980 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
305981 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
305982 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now

305992 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon who bought the handwritten copy at auction and with the blessing of the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans royalties will be donated to the childrens high level group to benefit institutionalised children in desperate need of a voice the new edition will include the tales themselves translated from the original runes by hermione granger and with illustrations by me but also notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive

306024 one of the problems to be ironed out will be the contract substitution which is getting rampant among overseas filipino workers ofws working in the service sector
306025 according to our labor laws we can file cases against both the employer and the deploying manpower agency under this provision hence a lot of erring manpower recruitment agencies have either lost their license to deploy ofws abroad or got their license suspended the uae government on the other hand does not allow filing of cases involving uae employers in the philippines

306028 the hypothesis is that in places where disease is rampant it behoves groups not to mix with one another more than is strictly necessary in order to reduce the risk of contagion the authors of the study therefore predict that patterns of behaviour which promote group exclusivity will be stronger in disease ridden areas since religious differences are certainly in that category they specifically predict that the number of different religions in a place will vary with the disease load which is as they report in the proceedings of the royal society the case

306067 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
306068 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
306069 t he union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
306070 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
306071 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
306072 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
306073 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
306074 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
306075 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
306076 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
306077 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
306078 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break
306079 its the most egregious fourth amendment violation that ive seen manufactured by any governmental regime
306080 and im sure this means that our government has now far surpassed the secret police of the eastern bloc countries that we used to be afraid of
306081 cbp is responsible for ensuring compliance with customs immigration and other federal laws at the border
306082 notwithstanding this law enforcement mission in the course of every border search cbp will protect the rights of individuals against unreasonable search and seizure
306083 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
306084 quite honestly the whole basis of searching luggage is for the instrumentalities of terrorism like bombs or cutting instrument of any kind but this is ridiculous
306085 but this is different than looking through somebodys luggage because there may be contraband there of a transported nature somebodys computer is the equivalent of someones mind or diary and the expectation of privacy in a computer vastly exceeds the expectation of privacy in your luggage
306086 us officials can also potentially look at travelers credit card and email accounts
306087 i am more convinced than ever that legislation is needed in order to protect law abiding americans from this gross violation of their privacy i intend to introduce such legislation soon
306088 considering the difficulties that courts and law enforcement agencies have in trying to identify what is or is not obscene because of the unusually distinct post hoc obscenity test it horrifies me to think what some untrained tsa guy that was making salads a week ago is going to do when he runs across sexually explicit material thats presumptively protected when he obviously has no idea about what is or is not the local community standard
306089 what if i download something for my own personal viewing under stanley v georgia the supreme court decision legalizing private ownership of obscene material i have the right to possess it and if i download something in amsterdam thats not obscene there and its not obscene where i live then what happens with the tsa or whoever homeland security assigns the obligation or the burden of having to look at this at an airport that im passing through on my way into the country if im allowed to possess obscenity and they come across that what does that do relative to the community standards if im flying through miami or dallas on my way to seattle
306090 to me theres no possible way to reconcile this kind of warrantless search with the presumptive protections regarding first amendment materials materials that may be sexually explicit but not obscene of which id say the vast majority are
306091 it just seems to me that theres no possible way to justify this kind of invasive search for any legitimate purpose i can understand them going through luggage or even my shoes to look for a bomb but this to me has absolutely no legitimate explanation i mean do they think theyre going to find plans on how to make a pipe bomb whatever speculative benefit might be derived relative to a governmental interest is so vastly outweighed by the invasion of privacy and loss of civil rights i cant find any legitimate reason to think its even remotely worth consideration
306092 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
306093 i think its really a lack of focus and attention by the federal government
306094 and i think the department of defense bares a special responsibility and my legislations designed to see them discharge it to make sure that those votes count
306095 this is something that if most americans knew existed the current dismal state of actual opportunity to see your vote count for our men and women in uniform they would be up in arms
306096 i think we have a significant responsibility to encourage our men and women in uniform to vote and to enable them to vote and so this is a high priority and your question prompts me to go find out if things are on track as i have been told they are in terms of making sure that we have the ballots and things available for our for our troops

306115 n o posso dizer se ele tinha raz o ou n o ao falar aquilo afinal tamb m n o temos id ia se ele sabia das les es dos atletas pode ser que o edmundo achasse que era uma coisa mas fosse outra o jogador tem como avaliar se ele pode atuar s que dif cil um atleta avaliar se o companheiro pode ou n o atuar
306116 conseguimos o que estava previsto as boas posi es nos treinos n o refletem nossa expectativa para a corrida queremos tentara chegar a terceira bateria no treino classificat rio para ent o tentarmos um ligar nas primeiras filas mas acho que vamos manter o ritmo das ltimas etapas

306129 we knew they were going to come out fired up and we were a little bit shell shocked at quarter time to be honest

306167 the munster council view the incidents which took place in cusack park ennis at the end of the munster under 21 hurling championship final between tipperary and clare with concern
306168 the report of the referee has been received by munster council this report will be examined in detail by the competitions control committee ccc of the council as a matter of urgency
306169 it is planned to convene a meeting of this body within the next couple of days and the council will issue no further statement until this meeting has taken place
306170 no one associated with clare hurling could condone what went on at the end of wednesdays game
306171 but there are a number of issues here what happened on the field and what happened off of it and while they are clearly related they are quite different too
306172 as bad as things were at the end i think some things are being taken out of context like there has been the suggestion that there was tension in cusack park from 5 30 that evening which is clearly a load of rubbish considering the ground wasnt opened until 6 10
306173 of course there is huge rivalry between clare and tipperary we came out of thurles last sunday very disappointed when the senior team lost to cork but wednesday was all about frustration most people would agree that 99 per cent of the gaa rules make sense but the inconsistency in applying them is whats most frustrating the reality is you can get penalised for one thing one day and not the next

306191 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
306192 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
306193 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
306194 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
306195 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy

306259 source port randomization to improve resilience against dns cache poisoning attacks
306260 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the internet protocol weakness
306261 we know with microsoft that there were a few problems even installing their dns patch
306262 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
306263 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
306264 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already

306321 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
306322 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
306323 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
306324 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighborhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
306325 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
306326 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
306327 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration it is very rare the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
306328 i dont criticize the stadium i criticize the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
306329 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
306330 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
306331 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
306332 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
306333 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
306334 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
306335 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
306336 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society

306352 americas artists are the guardians of the spirit of questioning of innovation of reaching across the barriers that fence us off from our neighbors from our allies and adversaries from the six billion other people with whom we share this dark and dazzling world

306359 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
306360 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
306361 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already
306362 this picture holds up on its own we have a fresh new take on the material we have chosen another archeologically rich nation china and weve set it in both two thousand years ago and in the twentieth century were back to try and save the world from tyrannical mummies
306363 the truth is the reason i became an actor is because i wanted to be indiana jones
306364 i asked michelle if there was anything that i needed to know because i hadnt met him yet
306365 for many years i always play good guys good guy is not easy always think about woman children dog neighbors and is not easy to do all the time villain is much easier just stand there and be selfish and think about yourself
306366 i never met dwayne the rock johnson when i shot that picture because he was just a big blue x on a stick jet li is the man
306367 i loved the original movie and i thought the time was right to make a really spectacular car action movie i was very inspired by roger corman who is a big hero of mine and a legend of cinema
306368 proud as i am of death race 2000 i have to admit death race is a bigger and better picture
306369 its nascar to the death in prison in the future shown on the internet and joan allen says fuck what more do you want
306370 as an actor you hope and dream that you get to do all kinds of things different types of genres comedy action and serious films so it was kind of a dream come true
306371 and it was such an evil character i just loved the fact that she was so bad it was very appealing to me
306372 the stunt men at one point said that they wanted extra money because the stunts were too dangerous i said screw that ill drive the car
306373 theres no way were going to make a movie like this and let the stuntmen do all the work this is what we do for a living
306374 every bit of the driving is us apart from any of the crashes or anything involving pyrotechnics
306375 thats why my partner robert tapert and i formed ghost house pictures so we could make horror pictures i would produce them and i wasnt very involved with each production i would see the dailies and see the directors having fun and i remembered how much fun it is to build suspense deliver scares and tell very simple horror stories like telling a good campfire story the spider man films are so complex i wanted to get back to the basics and do what i love doing telling a good simple campfire ghost story
306376 that was the wrong woman to throw under the bus
306377 i love working with bruce campbell hes a very funny guy and he has this quality of being able to physically endure anything to get a shot right i would love to work with bruce again so i can test those limits
306378 actually thats in the wheelhouse id like to work on the script with my brother ivan when he comes up to visit next week
306379 we took our favorite elements from the show stole them and put them into a new story we basically fashioned a story that is not about a father and his two kids but instead a lost soul who picks up a couple of other lost souls they are the wrong people to have to save the planet and they do
306380 its amazing at this point in my life to see a huge motion picture being made out of one of our favorite shows
306381 the organizer is not initialized or memory has been impaired emter y to initialize and clear all main memory contents
306382 i dont know if this is a drive format issue a drive content issue or bad os programming that makes your unit sh t itself wipe get a diaper and pop 2 immodium ads and then say okay ill give it a shot
306383 i may have generated a few million dollars in my career and the cash spent does not hurt me financially but that doesnt mean i have money to burn at the expense of bad engineering and a tad of false advertising i feel just as burnt as the dude who busts his back at a 9 5 just to save up enough money to go out and buy a piece of gear to pursue his dream only to not have it work as it should
306384 la percepci n de un filme queda incompleta si no la cierra una peque a discusi n un vago intercambio de ideas entre amigos o la lectura de un art culo que saque nuevas resonancias de la cinta
306385 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
306386 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

306391 today 1 year ago the first final release sidux 2007 01
306392 were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties
306393 that whole pc first thing you have to go back in id history to see why id initially developed for the pc
306394 wolfenstein 3d there was a nintendo version of that that was like a black day in id history how they made us change it to run on the nintendo platform
306395 wouldnt let you publish games on the console we didnt want to have our content governed by a third party
306396 but that dynamic isnt really like there anymore there are lots of games that have content whether its language or other forms of adult content that is pushing the bounds of content on all platforms
306397 we need to have all of these coordinated and released at the same time because thats the way to get your game out to the most people
306398 i think there are still some problems in the pc market
306399 there are issues in the market from a business standpoint which means having a pc only title that the level of investment to make a triple a game is a tough thing if your not doing a subscription model
306400 to open that up for the type of games we make isnt really appealing to us
306401 world of warcraft i can understand that they have a service based aspect to that game with our games we have always been about the free multiplayer stuff
306402 she wants to look as natural as possible yes we could do without the green shadow
306403 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
306404 audrey nous avons attrap big red il est en bas dans la salle de lavage nous lavons fait trait au refuge et sapelle maintenant grimace il est tr s gentil
306405 and after that mr phelps will leap a tall building in a single bound
306406 once i get to competition its like its like im in a cage so just let me out because i know exactly what to do
306407 you try almost being 8 months preggo and working 10 hours a day i bet your stupid ass couldnt handle it
306408 dunno mate try to eat something to keep your blood sugars up
306409 other breeds too have killed people for instance in 2000 a little pomeranian mix killed a six week old girl in southern california
306410 we started thousands of years ago by breeding dogs to be fighters selecting them for certain characteristics and matching them up with a similar mate we breed these dogs to be warriors but under their armor theyre simply dogs with more powerful weapons than other dogs en parlant des pit bull rottweiler et bull terrier they dont begin life as dangerously aggressive we can socialize them as puppies to get along with kids humans even cats and other animals though fighting is in their genes they need guidance to bring this instinct out
306411 people who raise pit bulls presa canarios cane corsos or other dogs for fighting turn these innocent dogs into killers by abusing them when theyre young the dogs are never allowed to be puppies they have to be warriors all the time the owners will start smacking the dog in the head at an early age putting hot sauce on his food teasing him letting him be attacked by a bigger dog all because they believe that this treatment will make the dog tough they will punch him and pinch him repeatedly until he bares his teeth at which point theyll stop pinching him in this way he learns to bare his teeth for self preservation theyll buy chickens and let the dog chase one while praising him then theyll tie the chicken up so the dog can learn to kill the dog has absolutely no choice in the matter when dog is no longer useful to the owner theyll discard him like trash often dumping him in a vacant lot or leaving him by the side of the road thats why youll see so many powerful breeds pit bulls and pit bull mixes boxers rottweilers mastiffs and german shepherds in shelters
306412 its all about the bond and relationship between the dog and his calm assertive pack leader
306413 when we stereotype a breed of dog by our worst expectations of its behavior we often create what we fear most
306414 a pit bull mix she has been bred to fight other dogs in illegal pit fights after she lost an important fight her owners poured gasoline over her and lit her on fire a rescue organization saved her life and she recovered from her burns but it was clear that her horrific experience had turned her into a dangerously human aggressive dog she started bitting people i heard about rosemary after she attacked two elderly men and immediately offered to take her and try to rehabilitate her rosemary was presented to me as a deadly dangerous dog when i brought her to the center however turning her around proved to be a piece of cake all she needed was a safe place and solid leadership in order to regain her trust into people before she had felt intimidated by people so shed make the first move thats when shes attack because in her experience if she didnt attack a person that person would hurt her it took no more than two days for me to earn her trust after that she was the sweetest most obedient dog you could imagine rosemary now lives with an adoptive family who loves her and cant believe she was ever human aggressive she turned out to be one of the best ambassador for the dog psychology center that i could ever imagine
306415 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
306416 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
306417 if they can double down on cars that could be one of their best bets
306418 listening to your own collection versus listening to a programmed experience is still fundamentally different and theres still a need for both
306419 its still stuck in the same loop of not yet having the volume of content that would spur a sale that would make hd content profitable that would allow broadcasters to create a greater volume of content
306420 anybody can whip up a music channel good or bad for nothing
306421 but to have youll have to pay through the nose and thats because howard stern is utterly scarce and attractive
306422 i enjoyed the comp alot however i do have one small niggle its a solo comp and fair enough competitors want a bit of backing support but i find that every year its beginning to sound like bands playing rather than soloists dont get me wrong the accompanists do a great job but does anyone think that it should be limited to a competitor 1
306423 this was a very difficult decision to make we have never sold a newspaper from my fathers time to my time

306428 crimes he was funny and political and if he lost his way occasionally that journey was fun too
306429 even jesus would have started repeating himself if they hadnt crucified him first
306430 america is going into total chaos becuase of the economy its the end of all of us as we know it
306431 we have eight people out right now and were all in one van with no trailer
306432 its like the ringling brothers clown car russian nesting dolls and tetris
306433 last year we played the montreal jazz festival in front of 5 000 people and then we did our own show and less than 50 people showed up
306434 mahh nothing like an icy cold shower after a long night
306435 hey rika why are you still up i would of imagined that tonight has been tiring with the graduation and all
306436 five years five awful yet wonderful years but why would you remember something like that baka yocchan why did you remember something so small something so small from two years ago from that stupid mecha mecha bakajo test
306437 so many years and here i am still running to you crying why
306438 how can you always be so strong why can you always cheer me up when i am at my lowest why do you treat me so well when i dont deserve it
306439 im sorry rika i always wanted to protect you from the tears of sadness i am sorry that i have cause you more pain that i have prevented just know that no matter what i will always lo
306440 when did this rika must of slipped it in my hand earlier
306441 you really dont do anything we dont want the bear hurt we want it to have a happy life but we really dont want a kid or pet to be hurt
306442 those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes
306443 we are slav macedonians thats who we are we have no connection to alexander the greek and his macedonia
306444 for cooperation among the various greek american congressional lobbying groups
306445 okkk give me some shrooms or hard liquour and lets tripp ballz
306446 hey when you come to the station you should bring your husband with you
306447 i think its really important to present positive black women and positive black men and especially positive black families
306448 what was the reaction inside the clubhouse to manny being traded
306449 reaction will come about as we get into our games i think the biggest reaction would be the fact that theres a means to an end that today came and either manny was going to be here or not this just kind of gives everybody closure so we can just go and play
306450 do you think that it was a distraction for the team these past weeks
306451 i think its been a little different for the team it was a little bit more outspoken he was more adamant on the fact that he wanted to go somewhere that he wanted to get out of here so it kind of puts us our hands are completely tied in the whole situation either way if manny was here today wed have to come in here and get direction and if manny wasnt here like it is now wed still have to get direction on where this team needs to go
306452 were you surprised at all that they actually traded manny
306453 well i mean some of us have been a part of this for eight years now laughs and uh surprised yeah because he brings an offense that you cant replace with anybody or expect someone to replace it but the cards were left in his hands and he made it to the point where they had to get rid of him
306454 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did theyre happy mannys happy im going to miss my man im not going to lie to you but were looking forward the team needed it
306455 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
306456 from the front office standpoint i feel like this did have to happen sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decisions was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the same goal
306457 i think ramirez constant griping had a big impact on people in upper management because there are important decisions to be made in the next couple of years
306458 best of luck manny but today is a new bay
306459 it is important for people to watch and realize that this video is conclusive proof that 9 11 was orchestrated by al qaeda at the most senior levels
306460 this is the kind of video proof that is going to put a lot of 9 11 conspiracy theorists out in the cold and for good reason

306469 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
306470 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
306471 i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
306472 if i was a fan id probably say the same things
306473 it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference
306474 one day you are going to need a doctorate to pump gas
306475 your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to concentrate your ability to concentrate is directly proportional to your ability to eliminate distraction distraction is created by mismanaged commitments your mind is limited in its ability to manage commitments because it is handicapped in its ability to remember and remind

306487 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
306488 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding

306576 this may sound harsh but we have to go by what we see
306577 were clearly sympathetic we understand that i understand that very well because i deal with a lot of the complaints
306578 this is just the city working against me and taking a piece out of me
306579 its never been our intent to victimize anybody whos a victim of a crime
306580 the reality is that they can come and ticket you for something they know is no wrongdoing or fault on your part
306581 its several power plants that we could shut down if everybody were to make the switch
306582 im trying to point out to folks that we can take matters into our own hands and we dont have to wait for the leaders to lead
306583 i think if people come and see these clotheslines even if they havent painted them even if they havent hung their laundry out they might begin to think look how beautiful

306605 i want to say from the bottom of my heart i want to thank the fans of boston
306606 i love you guys youve been with me through ups and downs
306607 when people ask about boston i put my brain on pause
306608 im not going to waste any energy when people talk like that
306609 i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
306610 in boston the fans the organization and the teammates were never an issue
306611 he preferred another city along the lines of the lifestyle he had in cleveland
306612 huh very interesting jesse and how did that make you feel

306617 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
306618 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended
306619 good morning we want to apply for a marriage license
306620 why not arent you giving marriage licenses to same gender couples
306621 yes thousands but we havent had any siblings thats incest
306622 not gay then why do you want to get married
306623 for the financial benefits of course and we do love each other besides we dont have any other prospects
306624 but were issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples whove been denied equal protection under the law if you are not gay you can get married to a woman
306625 wait a minute a gay man has the same right to marry a woman as i have but just because im straight doesnt mean i want to marry a woman i want to marry jim
306626 and i want to marry tim are you going to discriminate against us just because we are not gay
306627 all right all right ill give you your license next
306628 but weve only been granting licenses to gay and lesbian couples
306629 no its just that well the traditional idea of marriage is that its just for couples
306630 well i mean you have to draw the line somewhere
306631 who says theres no logical reason to limit marriage to couples the more the better besides we demand our rights the mayor says the constitution guarantees equal protection under the law give us a marriage license
306632 well my psychiatrist says i have a dual personality so i want to marry the two together maybe i can file a joint income tax return
306633 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended

306635 maybe if we could get whats that guys name dawg the bounty hunter to carry out the citizens arrest make it a reality tv show and go for one a week hell theres a years worth of programming in the executive branch alone
306636 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
306637 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
306638 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
306639 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
306640 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
306641 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
306642 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
306643 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
306644 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
306645 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
306646 world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for 33 years
306647 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
306648 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivinss case it led to his untimely death
306649 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
306650 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
306651 i cant believe what this country is becoming its sure not what i went to fight for
306652 nocera has probably put a lot of researchers out of business
306653 this is probably the most important single discovery of the century
306654 there are pods with floor pedals rack mounted pods pods that practically fit in your pocket
306655 what they all have in common is tonal quality and genuine functionality
306656 the two most overused adjectives for describing products in the music industry
306657 microfinance emerged as a struggle against loan sharks so we dont want to see new loan sharks created in the name of microcredit
306658 there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate
306659 dr sokol what do you think about the case of ashley x the disabled girl whose parents stunted her growth to care for her more easily
306660 what are your thoughts on ms a the teenage girl who told her doctor that she was abused by her father but begged the doctor to keep her secret
306661 should the parents of this severely disabled baby be allowed to insist on life sustaining treatment even if doctors think its futile
306662 you have to be a good solid platform conservative republican to be elected to the state executive committee of the republican party
306663 assistant sergeant of arms of the arizona republican party in that video only got that job because the party was tired of him pestering them my sources within the az gop tell me that seel was given that job to keep him quiet didnt work
306664 we think theyve rested up enough now and well get them back into a little bit of work
306665 hopefully we can keep building on what we did tonight
306666 its stupid and very bitter but i have to think of my health
306667 i struggled on the tour de france and i was sick
306668 this was a very good performance i am not dissatisfied with anything
306669 i think we played really well tonight because we had so much respect for lithuania who i think can be a medal winner in beijing
306670 we lost the game and we played very badly but you have to look at who we were playing against
306671 we played against the best team in the world they have the best players the best coaches the best everything and they played their best tonight
306672 guidebooks help but most of our bookings come through internet listings on websites like hostelworld com
306673 what we get are stopovers they are either going to or from australia singapore and bangkok and they take in kl for an average of three to four days
306674 there still are pimps and all that but they dont cause problems for the rest of us the real trouble is drug addicts when we first started they were occupying all the abandoned houses here in fact the restaurant next door is a godsend as it has displaced the addicts but theyre still around the jaga keretas illegal carpark attendants who extort money from those who park here and if they cant get enough for their fix they will resort to stealing
306675 i prefer to have the dogs as they will let you know if there are strangers in the night
306676 i got into this after practising law and then working in advertising because this is what i really like
306677 we actually do get guests who arrive in suits and i have to ask you do realise this is a budget hostel right
306678 these were all homes and we set up shop here on the five foot way where im standing now was a drain but dbkl built an additional brick sidewalk
306679 come at 5am and see if i have business or not
306680 he doesnt use any chemicals or whatever and the fruit only comes according to the season
306681 we budget hotels help each other out but some of the big players with a lot of money have been opening three or four hostels and paying very high rental theyre spoiling the market
306682 anwar has betrayed himself and the very people who support him he was a strong advocate of the new economic policy now he wants to abolish it granted there are corrupt politicians but why should we abolish the nep which is the basis of our constitutional rights
306683 anwar also tried to dilute islam whereas he proclaimed himself to be a champion of the religion why because he wanted to have the non malay support and well he got it in the last general election
306684 even if umno doesnt want me as the candidate for permatang pauh im willing to be at the constituency day and night to campaign for bn as well as to strip anwar of his populist claims
306685 if i contest im going to be the underdog i know its difficult to unseat anwar in his former constituency but its not about winning or losing its having the opportunity to face anwar and to tell the voters that they have been duped by the very man they revered
306686 if you notice anwar doesnt talk much about saiful actually its just a case between him and saiful who claimed that anwar had victimised him but anwar would rather tell his supporters that it is a battle between him and the government he must always be seen as a great man
306687 anwar has gone overboard he crossed the line and lost the statesmanship anwar lost all these in his pursuit for power
306688 people are not stupid even pas leaders have realised that i know there are a lot of resentment against anwar and pkr especially in selangor where the party is governing
306689 i know some people have accused pak lah of being politically weak but i see a strong resolve in that man he is serious about fighting corruption i might be wrong about the pm but at least he gives me the space to do something right for the country
306690 i will do it thats my commitment to umno if we dont clean up the party from bad elements how are going to reform society
306691 im flabbergasted by this whole thing this is the ultimate betrayal
306692 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy
306693 i got the idea to try to emulate a miniature version of a liberal arts college from my staff
306694 there are 400 recipes so theres a lot of different processes depending on the recipe
306695 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
306696 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
306697 a large number of variations in the appearance of normal female genitalia
306698 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
306699 the heart of a renegade is a skillfully crafted novel packed with complex characters involved in a well used plot line however it is innovatively done loreth anne whites pacing is superb maintaining ever mounting intensity as the story plays out this story is rich with detail and a plot that could be expanded to a 450 page hardcover that said it does not feel as if it were condensed but evolves in the expected manner only to twist and turn a bit adding interest and suspense the dynamics between jessica and luke are extraordinarily well handled white is a very gifted author and whose future novels will be sought out by this reviewer
306700 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy
306701 we reported this oversight to the regulators and we have fully cooperated with them in all aspects of this investigation
306702 t here is simply no basis for claims to the contrary
306703 in addition to our initiatives we are actively working with regulatory authorities including the to secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity
306704 there are a lot of unanswered questions that theyve managed to not answer
306705 im not trying to stop the purchase im just trying to stop a process in which there are no answers and theres no way to get answers
306706 if this is added on to the existing projects then its ok
306707 but i have every indication its not going to be added on its going to be used as an excuse
306708 we support the south florida water management district and have confidence that the district has operated within the public record laws of
306709 remains committed to open government and conducting itself according to the letter and spirit of the law throughout these complex and delicate negotiations
306710 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
306711 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
306712 many of my clients are women who have recently come out of long term relationships
306713 unsurprisingly they are insecure about taking the plunge again others are young men who dont know where to start but the common factor is usually a simple lack of confidence funnily enough most are successful business professionals but they fall apart socially yet the skills that guarantee them success at work decisiveness and communicating confidently are exactly those needed for dating and are actually transferable
306714 too many men think theyre brad pitt in search of a jennifer aniston but what i see opposite me is sometimes more like johnny vegas so a few home truths may be necessary but once you accept your limitations we can work around them
306715 to begin with why not just go over and say hi youd be amazed how many people dont take that simple initiative and exude confidence even if youre faking it
306716 this accounts for 55 per cent of social interaction but many people men especially cant read the signals or unconsciously transmit negative ones i teach people to interpret body language and be aware of their own so they can learn to modify it
306717 i cant testify to the navs high speed handling in the twisties because im not an idiot
306718 well duh high ground clearance good off road tips over easily way to state the obvious frickin rocket scientists
306719 oh yeah i was asked to speak at blogher yawn then i broke a nail and the dog dumped on the floor
306720 look how cool we are to have this in our area we walked here bringing our hip grocery carts in tow right after we stopped at the neighborhood whole foods what were you doing dodging old people in the street oh on the sidewalk lame whatev
306721 the whole picture of billy long is a lot different
306722 from the day of the defendants arrest the defense has attacked the cw cooperating witness overstreet

307030 i really did grow up a nerd this is not an exaggeration and i felt left out all the time nowadays i remember that feeling and i want everyone to be included
307031 you can capture the collective intelligence of all the people who are writing and use that to help the people who are searching its a sort of group intelligence
307032 how do you innovate a social community a website where every action is policed doesnt work but complete anarchy doesnt work either its actually the same problem we face off line its the problem of living together

307046 everyone has carved out a segment of the pie but its gotten so much larger that they can all survive and be successful
307047 the benefit for allowing this is to allow for players who have limited space on their hard disk drive
307048 we are aware that a lot of players are complaining about this and what the drm enables us to do thank god is to keep track of who has purchased this already providing they have purchased it once they have the freedom to go and delete whatever episodes they have already played and do not wish to sit on their hard disk drive say they played episode three already they delete it once because they want space for some other game or what have you but then they want to revisit that episode they can always go back to the store and download episode three again whenever they wish if we stuck to a one through four five through eight and what have you they would have been stuck to a larger chunk so in order to maximize on that flexibility weve kept it to a per episode structure
307049 are you going to keep us waiting months and months and months for the next batch of episodes
307050 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
307051 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform
307052 if you were doing a whole lot of simulation you can in theory get more performance out of the cell processor than out of the two other dual thread processors on the 360 but thats a big in theory
307053 the fact that blu ray won the format wars on there is a huge feather in sonys cap and then we wind up with cases like what were seeing right now where having all the extra space on the blu ray may be a useful thing for us above the fact that the hardwares not quite as good in terms of what it can do with the processing
307054 thats why any time that people make comments one way or the other about the consoles its easy to leave aside of the fact that its the best that its ever been in any generation in terms of support capabilities and all that
307055 were developing on the pc but we have 360 controllers on all the pcs
307056 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform
307057 the fact that blu ray won the format wars on there is a huge feather in sonys cap and then we wind up with cases like what were seeing right now where having all the extra space on the blu ray may be a useful thing for us above the fact that the hardwares not quite as good in terms of what it can do with the processing
307058 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform
307059 if you were doing a whole lot of simulation you can in theory get more performance out of the cell processor than out of the two other dual thread processors on the 360 but thats a big in theory
307060 weve had a couple of last minute bugs and some tweaks to do when trophies become involved you have start ensuring that cheating is prevented or at least made harder so thereve been a few things like that that have slowed things down
307061 certainly we have our marquee titles with wolfenstein doom and quake and doom really is the big gun out of that the one that everybody remembers
307062 even if people love it and you can make as ea has shown you can run the sports titles every year and people will love it and as activision is showing you can sell call of duty every year and people will love it
307063 we did feel some pressure to try and strike out and do something different
307064 i mean there are still great things you can do inside any given niche like that but we wanted to really strongly address some of those things
307065 its going to hopefully be a broader appeal to the game with not so much the be scared out of your wits while youre running around tense
307066 i mean the first game we worked on in creating new ip that we rebooted was called darkness and i was thinking this is just going to be another thing that people hate us for the exact same things so were going to go ahead and do the running over mutants in a pickup truck sorta thing in the outside
307067 we went into this knowing that we had the humility to say were great at what we do and were all smart and were all talented we can learn these other things but we dont know it yet and we have to go in with this freedom to fail sort of approach were going to go take some cuts at it we dont expect it to be right first and well work on it as long as it takes

307069 mi vida ha sido muy linda soy profesor de literatura inglesa y espa ola he recorrido todo estados unidos invitado por universidades mi obra es conocida en el mundo acad mico se han hecho numerosas tesis doctorales sobre ella no me importar a ser m s popular pero eso implicar a tener un agente literario y por tanto que mi cach se disparara y eso quiz s impedir a que yo pudiera viajar a tantos sitios como ahora
307070 donde los latinos han optado por escribir en ingl s porque el mercado es mucho m s grande
307071 va a haber gente de habla hispana en cada estado cada vez m s pero la influencia del ingl s es muy fuerte e ir borrando el espa ol el bombardeo cultural en ingl s es abrumador y la alternativa de los medios de comunicaci n hispanos no tiene calidad el espa ol ya no se extingue en la tercera generaci n empieza a desaparecer en la segunda
307072 el spanglish is my face mi coraz n mi identidad
307073 to come to espa a y hablar de spanglish es ser quixote
307074 people in la pen nsula just dont get it no les entra en la head que en los unaited estados la civilizaci n latina is a new way de ser hispano ser atacado is an inspiration
307075 my name es ilan stavans ling ista cultural critic y revoloteador

307077 espero disfrutes de todo esto habr novedades editoriales exclusivas literarias y la posibilidad de contactar con escritores agentes lectores y editores directamente
307078 we have concerns about the 360 version of rage because of the economics of the platform in terms of what it costs to go to multiple discs
307079 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
307080 let me be clear this is an open question we have these tech issues and we are working with microsoft to solve them
307081 i know that john is pretty much brass tacks on these issues and before the ps3 was ever released he raised the same issues then as now
307082 had a bunch of hardware engineers talking about theoretical power but carmack said yeah this isnt how software people work and they said yeah this is how they should work
307083 complaining about that is sort of a worthless exercise at this point
307084 the ps3 is what it is and its not going to change you have to adapt thats what we have done with id tech 5
307085 today we are saying that rage may look better on the ps3 than the 360
307086 i think the blu ray strategy and some of the other things theyve done in terms how the ps3 is positioned as a home entertainment device shows that sony is placing their bet on the ps3 as a marathon runner not a sprint and microsoft was a little more focused on the short term goals
307087 as soon as you start saying you have enough memory you better hide and watch brother
307088 oh i interviewed ken livingstone yesterday and i was arrested and held in solitary for three days last week yep for blockading a nuclear base oh and i learned to drive an inflatable boat and scottish parliament passed a motion in support of our actions um and theres a concert onboard tomorrow with lots of my heroes playing
307089 you cant sink a rainbow and you cant lock up a sunrise
307090 its not the end of the story by any means
307091 so that if we ever got nuked by another country at least we would have the ability to retaliate

307114 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
307115 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors
307116 we made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new merlin engines at once
307117 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert
307118 i have a condition known as crohns disease and i could have to have blood at any time
307119 so its a scary thing to think about that if you have to have blood is it going to be available for me
307120 esa estatizaci n podr a verse en dos escenarios el primero que se trate de un hecho aislado y el segundo que sea el inicio de una pol tica financiera que tenga como fin tomar posesi n a trav s de la estatizaci n de las instituciones claves del sistema financiero para extender el poder del estado al sistema bancario que es de suma trascendencia para la naci n
307121 eso m s bien implicar a elementos de seguridad para las inversiones espa olas donde el banco de venezuela es emblem tico
307122 los ciudadanos no tienen una buena opini n sobre la gesti n econ mica oficial en su conjunto empezando por la industria petrolera que no est bien manejada y continuando por las industrias b sicas de guayana y siguiendo con las instituciones recientemente nacionalizadas como la telef nica y la electricidad qye ya empezaron a presentar fallas en los servicios entonces los clientes comenzar n a preguntarse si con el sistema financiero no pasar lo mismo tiene que haber temor porque el sistema financiero es el coraz n del sistema circulatorio del pa s
307123 en estos momentos en venezuela no est n dadas las condiciones para un proceso semejante creo que es necesario esperar el desarrollo de los acontecimientos
307124 estoy interesado en comprar y vamos a nacionalizar el banco de venezuela dijo en un discurso transmitido en cadena de radio y televisi n
307125 tengo copia del documento que firman un preacuerdo el grupo santander de espa a y un banquero venezolano
307126 entonces ahora los due os dicen no no queremos vender y yo digo no yo se lo compro cu nto vale que se lo pagamos
307127 estaban desesperados por vender el banco incluso tratando de presionarme
307128 a los se ores due os para que vengan por aqu y empecemos a negociar
307129 vamos a recuperar el banco de venezuela para ponerlo al servicio de los venezolanos de toda la econom a venezolana nos hace mucha falta un banco de esa magnitud
307130 para iniciar un proceso que no va a ser para nada conflictivo y no va a generar ning n problema
307131 una banca en manos del estado asegura que los recursos de los depositantes apoyen al sector estatal de la econom a que cada vez demanda mayores recursos para su funcionamiento en vista de la ineficiencia y las p rdidas que genera
307132 el socialismo del siglo xxi al igual que los experimentos fracasados del siglo xx tiene una matriz profundamente estatista
307133 para el ministerio p blico esta audiencia es una manifestaci n de lo establecido en el art culo 42 de la constituci n la sentencia que aqu se dicte va a envolver la sentencia judicial firme a la que alude el ar t culo 42 porque tiene que ver con la nulidad que invocan los recurrentes de los actos que les impuso las sanciones
307134 esa sentencia firme no se est sacando de lado hay una decisi n administrativa de la contralor a que se est recurriendo en sede jurisdiccional buscando la sentencia firme a la que alude este art culo 42 y justamente buscando esa sentencia solicitan los recurrentes la inconstitucionalidad del art culo 105 no es que el acto del contralor qued all y que sin sentencia de ning n tipo vamos a decir estas personas per se se encuentran inhabilitadas con una decisi n definitivamente firme en sede administrativa sabemos que hay m s camino por recorrer que nos quedan cosas por hacer y por eso en busca de esa sentencia firme estamos en esta sala
307135 si no hay condena judicial no hay inhabilitaci n ninguno de nosotros hemos sido condenados
307136 ante la pretensi n del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj de retardar la decisi n sobre el caso de las inhabilitaciones pol ticas impuestas a m s de 400 personas por la contralor a general de la rep blica
307137 pareciera que el tsj pretende darle largas al asunto y no dar respuesta definitiva sobre lo que va a pasar con estas personas a las que se les est cercenando su derecho
307138 a los principios y valores ticos y morales que los llevaron a ocupar esos cargos de representaci n judicial y que en definitiva no permitan que el pueblo siga en esta incertidumbre
307139 acompa ar a las personas que se les pretende inhabilitar
307140 in the near term we want to launch these with great customization and a great library of accessories this fall
307141 its been a good first two days and a fun first two days
307142 i love the opportunity to get our games ready and sharp for next week going into the pga but this is an awesome event and im excited that i put myself in a good position heading into the weekend
307143 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
307144 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
307145 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges
307146 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
307147 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum
307148 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
307149 as you can see the stig is driving around the track in a benchmark car bmw m3 or something points are given for any second under the stigs time points are lost for any second over
307150 it is alleged she was grabbed from behind when walking back through her front door and a man then bound her hands and feet with wire and gagged her mouth with a cloth
307151 she was then allegedly hit around the head and scratched around her torso with wire before being indecently assaulted
307152 it is alleged she was grabbed from behind when walking back through her front door and a man then bound her hands and feet with wire and gagged her mouth with a cloth
307153 the combination of our companies will provide an even more efficient flexible marketing option for livestock producers
307154 i am particularly concerned that shorter journey times would render livestock farming in parts of scotland untenable for example it takes 14 hours by sea to transport sheep from shetland to aberdeen
307155 while i support the slaughter of livestock as close as possible to the farm where they are fattened this is impractical in remote areas of scotland after eu regulations forced the closure of small rural abattoirs

307165 when we hear about islamist resistance lets try to put ourselves where they are and try to see it from their point of view
307166 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves
307167 for atheists considered worthy of the death penalty by islamists to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking canadian civic society demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies
307168 there are more people now saying they dont have answers
307169 this is the new frontier how are people going to eat when theres global warming and when so few will be able to grow food
307170 the issues of justice inequality and poverty are common themes we can work together on they are concerns of conscience
307171 ce rapport pr sente une vision globale dune strat gie internationale pour la politique islamique selon ses lignes directrices et en accord avec elles les politiques islamiques locales sont labor es dans les diff rentes r gions
307172 we think this is coming from the bush appointed ideologues that are in there who are not apologetic about the departments stance on being anti woman anti birth control and anti abortion

307259 sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of a political nature and should be promptly removed
307260 strong positive signal that the only way is negotiation and dialogue
307261 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
307262 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
307263 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
307264 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
307265 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
307266 if there is an award for most patriotic workplace we should win it hands down
307267 nobody forced anybody we just felt we were in the mood to celebrate the nations birthday so we put up the flags

307269 i came across an article about a diploma mill in us busted by the us government
307270 then a news agency got hold of the list which including all the nine thousands plus clients from around the world
307271 their purpose is actually to alert the us government because some of the immigrants actually entered us with the fake certs
307272 however i saw that there are many names from singapore on the list as well
307273 this interests me most of the clients purchased bachelor degree but there are some who purchased masters and phd degrees as well
307274 that is interesting i wonder if any of them still working in singapore using their fake certificates
307275 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
307276 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
307277 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
307278 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
307279 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
307280 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
307281 the government has taken pains to appear receptive and culturally sensitive to the arrival of an anticipated 500 000 olympic visitors the final number may be considerably smaller due to tightened visa restrictions as testified to by the thousands of hotel rooms still empty
307282 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
307283 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
307284 many africans say it is difficult to find a taxi because the drivers worry they wont be paid
307285 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
307286 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person
307287 sometimes ill run down the street and jump into the cab with the chinese person and say ok lets go together the chinese person will usually get out of the cab
307288 guan jian a professor of social psychology at nankai university in tianjin said chinese tend to link stereotypes to the country people are from not their skin color
307289 for instance americans are warm and outgoing japanese are hardworking but stingy germans are inflexible but punctual
307290 the stereotypes were formed historically but may change with passing time
307291 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business

307335 what an artist does is show you something in a new way theres always something more than what meets the eye
307336 i dont know that anybody else has done the work that she has done
307337 theres never really been a reason for me to go into the early history she was focusing on the cemetery ive always focused on the parks
307338 the remains of over 10 000 dead persons still to be taken away
307339 its not as if someone wasnt doing their job or someone was lying it just got very confusing
307340 that was the basis of several of the history books
307341 a lot of these things are speculation her speculation is as good as anyones but some of these are questions that cant be answered
307342 that makes it sound like a graveyard and its not
307343 the land has been disturbed too much its skeletal remains
307344 recent excavations exposed row after row of the heads of coffins in a state of good preservation

307354 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
307355 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
307356 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
307357 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
307358 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
307359 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
307360 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
307361 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
307362 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
307363 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
307364 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
307365 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
307366 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
307367 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
307368 we have a mionor update resize copy change addition etc
307369 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
307370 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
307371 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
307372 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
307373 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
307374 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
307375 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
307376 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
307377 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
307378 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
307379 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
307380 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
307381 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
307382 who are open to doing something on the production side
307383 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
307384 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
307385 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
307386 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
307387 a year ago i was exactly the same place she is
307388 the most visible and significant progress is the announced establishment of a permanent unama office in tarin kowt the ana brigade is progressing well the focus district development is on its way these are all good signs for a safe and secure environment for the people of uruzgan
307389 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
307390 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
307391 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
307392 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
307393 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
307394 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
307395 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
307396 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
307397 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
307398 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
307399 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
307400 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
307401 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
307402 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
307403 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
307404 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
307405 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
307406 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
307407 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
307408 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
307409 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
307410 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
307411 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
307412 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
307413 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
307414 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
307415 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
307416 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
307417 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
307418 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
307419 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
307420 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
307421 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
307422 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
307423 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
307424 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
307425 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
307426 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
307427 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
307428 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
307429 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
307430 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
307431 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
307432 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
307433 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
307434 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
307435 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
307436 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
307437 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
307438 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
307439 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
307440 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
307441 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
307442 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
307443 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
307444 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
307445 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
307446 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
307447 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
307448 i dont think this was a warning directed at just the residents of tsawwassen
307449 i think this was a warning to residents all over british columbia where any of these power projects are being pushed through
307450 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
307451 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
307452 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
307453 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
307454 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
307455 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
307456 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
307457 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
307458 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
307459 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
307460 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
307461 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
307462 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
307463 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
307464 all staff must follow the rulings in the brinker decision effective immediately and the decision shall be applied to pending matters
307465 major fraction thereof means the time period between three and one half hours and four hours
307466 if you are unable to get your w 2 from your employer you can call the irs for assistance at 1 800 829 1040 you should have the following information on hand when you call your employers name and address your name address and social security number and an estimate of your wages the federal income tax withheld and the period you worked for that employer you can find this year to date information on your final paycheck stub for the year or on your leave and earnings statement if you left that employer
307467 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
307468 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
307469 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
307470 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
307471 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
307472 well if you think shes pretty you should see how smart her sister is she gets straight as she is on the honor roll she takes advanced classes her sister is so smart that she is practically a genius
307473 well if you thing thats good you should hear her sister she plays violin violin is so much more difficult and she is good her sister takes lessons
307474 i thought i was smart too but look what happened to me and i ended up abused

307477 quebecs got bill 101 to protect the culture and everything else
307478 weve got to protect our culture in our education system we have to protect our language
307479 there are huge privacy concerns that are raised when people with hiv go through the system particularly given the fact that hiv is not something that is easily spread
307480 to free prior informed consent over anything potentially impacting our land
307481 the proposed free trade agreement between canada and colombia is all about enabling the corporate agenda
307482 theres no scientific basis for the public fear of uranium exploration but mining companies do recognize the government must calm its citizens
307483 i will call on a new generation of americans to join our military and complete the effort to increase our ground forces by 65 000 soldiers and 27 000 marines
307484 i think we have a little more life in us now
307485 the cuban athletes were badly taken care of that city has the privilege of hosting that championship every year we should analyze whether it is worth attending that tournament
307486 they do not have to deal with an economic blockade both countries have great resources no one steals or plunders their athletes
307487 it is disgusting to read about the details of the commercial arrangements surrounding the case
307488 i can call my brother a jerk but dont you dare do it or ill beat you to the ground

307492 the choice is clear most of all we can choose between hope and fear it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
307493 what has he ever done what does he propose to do specifically
307494 im sorry that you saw it like that and that it hurt you but it means nothing you are the person i love
307495 dan telah mengisyaratkan oleh izzuddin abdis salam bahawa memadai pada kelebihan berpuasa di bulan rejab dengan apa yang telah diriwayatkan oleh beberapa hadis yang menunjukkan atas fadhilat kelebihan puasa iaitu
307496 ya rasulullah tidak ada benda yang saya makan di siang hari yang saya makan melainkan dimakan pada malam sahaja
307497 berpuasalah dibulan sabar dan tiga hari selepasnya dan berpuasalah di bulan bulan haram
307498 berpuasalah tiga hari selepasnya dan berpuasalah di bulan haram dan tinggalkanlah puasalah di bulan haram dan tinggalkanlah rasululah saw bersabda sambil menghimpunkan jari jarinya yang tiga kemudian melepaskannya
307499 hendaklah kamu ingat mengingat antara satu sama lain kerana ingat mengingat itu memberi manfaat kepada orang mukmin
307500 saya nasihatkan dato supaya dalam menjalankan kerja harian dato marilah kita sama sama ikut sunnah rasul sallallahu alaihi wasallam
307501 apakah saudara dapat terangkan kepada saya erti dan maksud sunnah rasul
307502 semua perbuatan semua perkataan dan semua pengakuan yang keluar dipraktikkan daripada nabi adalah semuanya sunnah
307503 saya mohon maaf untuk berkata bahawa awak adalah orang pertama yang akan menjadi penghuni neraka
307504 apakah awak semua ini beristeri dengan seorang perempuan tua yang sudah janda dua kali saya tidak fikir begitu jika demikianlah maka awak semua berdosa kerana tidak mengikut sunnah sebagaimana yang awak semua faham
307505 awak semua selesa simpan janggut pakai jubah dan berserban dengan ekor serban yang panjang pakailah saya hormat dengan pakaian awak begitu mungkin pakaian begitu dapat menghalang awak daripada melakukan kerja kerja mungkar dan maksiat tetapi janganlah menganggap orang lain yang tidak serupa dengan awak sebagai dosa
307506 antara kami ramai yang telah melakukan zina minum arak tidak pernah mengerjakan ibadah sembahyang dan puasa tetapi setelah berkenalan dengan jemaah tabligh terus saja kami dapat meninggalkan segala dosa besar itu hati kami pula merasa suci tenang dan dapat pula kami keluar berdakwah kepada orang lain
307507 tetapi pakaian yang serebeh selekeh dan tidak kemas seperti tidak kemasnya pakaian golongan hippi bukanlah tuntutan islam hadis nabi s a w yang bermaksud
307508 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat kepada rupa paras kamu dan harta kamu tetapi dia memandang kepada hati kamu dan amal kamu
307509 jangan kamu mengadakan sesuatu yang baru dalam beragama kerana benda yang diadakan itu bidaah setiap yang bidaah itu sesat dan setiap yang sesat itu berakhir di neraka
307510 sesungguhnya di dalam syurga ada sebuah sungai yg dipanggil rejab warna airnya sangat putih dari susu manisnya lebih manis dari madu barangsiapa yg berpuasa satu hari dari bulan rejab maka allah akan memberi ia minum dari sungai itu
307511 barang siapa berpuasa sehari didalam bulan rejab seolah olah dia berpuasa satu tahun dan siapa yg berpuasa di dalamnya 7 hari maka akan ditutup 7 pintu pintu neraka jahannam dan barang siapa yg berpuasa 8 hari maka 8 pintu pintu syurga akan terbuka dan barang siapa yg berpuasa 10 hari tidaklah jika dia berdoa melainkan akan dimakbulkan allah barangsiapa yang berpuasa 15 hari menyerulah penyeru dari langit
307512 bahawa nabi saw tidak pernah berpuasa selepas ramadhan melainkan rejab dan syaban
307513 sesungguhnya para ulama telah menetapkan bahawa hadits hadits dhaif mursal munqothi mudhal dan mauquf diamalkan dengannya pada fadho ilil amal atas dasar ijma maka tidak syak lagi bahawa berpuasa rejab adalah sebahagian daripada fadho ilil amal memadailah padanya dengan hanya berdalilkan hadits hadits dhaif dan yang sepertinya tiadalah diingkari demikian itu melainkan orang orang yang jahil yang terpedaya
307514 bahawa yang sebenar adalah perkataan dari orang yang berkata sunat berpuasa hari isnin dan khamis rejab dan baki hari hari di bulan haram
307515 sepertimana satu hadits yang telah meshahihkannya oleh ibnu khuzaimah daripada usamah ra
307516 wahai rasululah saya tidak pernah melihat tuan berpuasa sepanjang bulan daripada seluruh bulan sepertimana tuan berpuasa bulan syaban
307517 demikian itu adalah satu bulan yang lalai manusia daripadanya yang berada antara rejab dan ramadhan maka bulan syaban adalah satu bulan yang diangkat di dalamnya semua amal ke hadrat rabbil alamin maka aku suka bahawa diangkat amalanku dalam keadaan aku berpuasa
307518 maka aku suka bahawa diangkat amalanku dalam keadaan aku berpuasa
307519 sesungguhnya dalam syurga ada sebuah mahligai bagi sesiapa yang berpuasa di bulan rejab
307520 abu qilabah salah seorang tabiin yang tidak akan berkata mengenainya melainkan diambilnya dari seorang penyampai sahabat
307521 saya telah bertanya said bin jubair berkenaan puasa rejab sedangkan kami ketika itu masih berada di bulan rejab
307522 saya telah mendengar ibnu abbas berkata adalah rasulullah berpuasa sehingga kami mengatakan menyangka baginda tidak berbuka tidak berhenti puasa dan baginda berbuka sehingga kami mengatakan menyangka baginda tidak berpuasa
307523 aah itu hadits yang menunjukan harus puasa di bulan rejab bukannya sunat memang dibolehkan jika berpuasa tanpa mengaitkan bulan rejab sebab dalilnya hanya bersandarkan dalil yang umum akan hadits shahih riwayat muslim tersebut
307524 yang dzahir bahawa maksud said bin jubair dengan istidlal pengambilan hukum dengan hadits ini bahawa puasa rejab tidak ditegah dan tidak disunatkan berdasarkan hadits ini untuk ain yakni diri atau perkara puasa rejab itu
307525 bulan rajab adalah salah satu daripada tadhamun kepada makna asyh harul haram
307526 tidak ada langsung bezanya bulan rejab dengan bulan bulan yang lain sebab semua hadits haditsnya adalah maudhu dan dhaif
307527 adalah mereka yang menafikan secara mutlak fadhilat bulan rejab adalah melakukan kesalahan yang mesti ditangani oleh pemerintah lantaran perbuatan menyalahfahamkan keterangan yang hak yang menjejaskan kepentingan awam
307528 sebahagian dari puasa yang disunatkan ialah puasa dibulan bulan haram iaitu zul qaedah zul hujjah muharram dan rejab
307529 hendaklah menilai semula fatwa fatwa ulama jangan ikut sahaja membuta tuli
307530 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life

307536 and ive always wondered why my mother made the decision that she did
307537 she wanted the best for you and she knew that she couldnt give it to you it was probably the hardest thing shes ever done
307538 i just wanted to write and thank you for last night

307541 wal mart wants its workers to believe it has their best interests at heart but as workers told us this week when coming to us with these stories they know better the current wal mart culture is good for wal mart executives good for the walton family but very bad for hourly employees
307542 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it

307551 i believe in you and your mission from the depths of my heart i testify and confirm that what you say is the truth call me to your religion for verily you are the prophet of god and that is a great honor
307552 there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet and messenger
307553 whenever i offered islam to any one he always showed some reluctance and hesitation and tried to enter into an argument abu bakr was the only person who accepted islam without any reluctance or hesitation and without any argument
307554 i had a premonition about the advent of the prophet therefore when the apostle of god was sent i believed in him
307555 the moderation and the veracity of abu bakr confirmed thc new religion and furnished an example for invitation
307556 tiap tiap perkataan yang bercerai cerai dengan penceraian yang dilafazkan
307557 adalah kitab kitab yang dahulu diturunkan daripada pintu yang satu di atas yakni dengan bahasa yang satu dan diturunkan quran daripada tujuh pintu di atas yakni dengan tujuh bahasa iaitu
307558 dan apa jua suruhan yang dibawa oleh rasul allah kepada kamu maka ambillah akan dia serta amalkan dan apa jua yang dilarang kamu melakukannya maka patuhilah larangannya
307559 dan ia iaitu nabi muhammad saw tidak memperkatakan sesuatu yang berbohong dengan agama islam menurut kemahuan dan pandangannya sendiri segala yang diperkatakannya itu sama ada al quran atau hadits tidak lain melainkan wahyu yang diwahyukan kepadanya
307560 terdapat seorang ahli fekah yang sentiasa menegah manusia daripada berpuasa di bulan rejab yang mana adalah kerana kejahilan padanya dan membuat suatu keputusan tanpa pertimbangan berdasarkan kaedah syariat yang sucinya
307561 bahawasanya neraka jahanam menyala nyala bermula daripada haul pusingan daripada satu haul kepada satu haul bagi sesiapa yang berpuasa rejab
307562 nazar puasanya sah beliau tersebut sebenarnya telah melazimkan penghampiran diri kepada allah taala dengan seumpama mengerjakan puasa
307563 tiap tiap anak adam adalah baginya yakni boleh diketahui hitungan pahalanya melainkan puasa
307564 sesungguhnya berubah bau mulut seseorang yang berpuasa terlebih harum disisi allah taala daripada bau kasturi
307565 sesungguhnya seafdhal afdhal puasa ialah puasa saudaraku daud as beliau berpuasa sehari dan berbuka sehari
307566 i have only stopped beating you because i am tired
307567 you have corrupted them you may free them if you are so sympathetic to them
307568 son i hear you are freeing old and weak persons why dont you free healthy and strong persons who could be a source of strength to you
307569 the holy prophet said that it was so thereupon the quraish fell upon the holy prophet and gave him a severe beating when abu bakr came to know of this he rushed to the spot he interposed himself between the holy prophet and the quraish weeping and saying
307570 would you kill a man for saying that allah is his lord
307571 i hear that muhammad is satirizing me if i find him i will smash him we reject the reprobate his words we repudiate his religion we loathe and hate
307572 o abu bakr we cannot suffer you to go from makkah you are an asset to the city you are always keen to fulfill the needs of others you are so good and noble i take you under my protection and you should come back with me to makkah rest assured no harm will come to you
307573 have you given him this protection so that he may publicly injure our feelings he recites the quran in a sweet voice and we fear that he may seduce our women and youth to his faith you should advise him to pray indoors
307574 you are advising me as i am under your protection what if i renounce your protection
307575 o son of abu qahafa suppose we married our son to your daughter you would turn him into an infidel and convert him to your religion
307576 o prophet of god all that i have is yours
307577 there are many things beyond ones comprehension and if muhammad peace be on him says that he went to jerusalem and ascended the heavens it must be true for he never tells a lie and being a prophet he commands resources that are not available to others
307578 all this is true your description is faithful and correct i believe in every word of what you have said
307579 verily abu bakr you are the siddiq you have a penetrating vision and you can discern the truth which an ordinary person finds difficult to understand surely many things can be done under the command of allah which ordinary human intellect may not be able to grasp

307620 his image and the messages associated with the campaign resonate with me
307621 just the way he emotes provides insight into his character

307639 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

307847 he would know something kept him there for 55 years and it wasnt the strength of the kenya shilling against the us dollar
307848 lo cierto es que esta persona estaba con pulsera y era visto fuera de su casa todo el tiempo
307849 el acuerdo cuando se aprob la ley era igualar el sueldo base al sueldo m nimo y que al trabajador al final del d a entre el sueldo base que se iba a transformar en sueldo m nimo m s las comisiones la garant a que se le daba a los empleadores y a los trabajadores es que al final del d a no iba a haber cambios en los ingresos
307850 por sobretodo en ning n caso los trabajadores iban a trabajar menos y si iba a establecer un per odo de transici n ese es el acuerdo
307851 hay un tema adicional que no hay que confundirlo con esto y es que el sector empresarial sistem ticamente durante todos estos a os no ha pagado como corresponde el s ptimo d a hay trabajadores que tienen derecho al pago del s ptimo hasta ahora el empresariado les pagaba no sobre el total promedio diario de sus remuneraciones sino el sueldo base es decir se le est esquilmando durante casi 20 a os el pago del s ptimo a los trabajadores del comercio
307852 aqu m s que subir los ingresos se establece una normalizaci n o regularizaci n de la norma para que no se le deje de pagar a lo que tienen derecho los trabajadores y por tanto esta afirmaci n de que se busca aumentar el sueldo es falsa lo que se busca con esta ley es generar una norma para que no se le robe m s a los trabajadores la forma como se calcula el s ptimo
307853 si respecto al procedimiento de pago hay que hacer un proceso de transici n eso es un dictamen de la direcci n del trabajo y si con esto se busca evitar el pago del s ptimo para personas que no son trabajadores de venta directa sino el que est a cargo de la oficina de la tienda persones que reciben comisiones de otra naturaleza eso tambi n es discutible pero lo que no es discutible es que se le debe pagar el s ptimo de acuerdo a la nueva norma y ese pago normalizado es la devoluci n de un derecho que ten an los trabajadores y que sectores del empresario les robaban les quitaban no se lo cancelaban debidamente
307854 le llama mucho la atenci n respecto de esta ley la actitud de los sectores empresariales porque las empresas del retail les ha ido extremadamente bien las fusiones demuestran aquello su expansi n en am rica latina demuestra eso y ver como reclaman hoy es algo pat tico y ver las actitudes de un colega nuestro andr s allamand que trata de borrar con la mano lo que se aprob un nimemente en el congreso tambi n llama la atenci n porque uno tiene que saber y estudiar lo que aprueba y hacerse cargo de ello y no desdecirse porque recibi presiones externas de ciertos sectores empresariales eso me parece indebido
307855 es complementaria a un proyecto que se aprob anteriormente donde se fij como sueldo base la medida para poder calcular el pago de imposiciones y el pago de las horas extraordinarias
307856 estaban pagando en retail sueldos de 4 y 5 mil pesos como base hasta de mil pesos entonces se calculaban las imposiciones considerando el sueldo base en este caso los 4 mil pesos entonces se dicta ese cuerpo legal y en esa oportunidad el empresariado no reclam absolutamente nada
307857 fue aprobada por unanimidad y por lo tanto los socialistas no vamos a aceptar que algunos integrantes de la comisi n se desdigan de lo que aprobaron un nimemente
307858 le hubi semos hecho un da o al pa s si vot bamos por pfeiffer

307862 the peace negotiations depend on syria there is no place solely for overtures but there must also be action syria must decide between iran the axis of evil and international isolation and between peace and prosperity
307863 as if syria asked israel to break off relations with the united states
307864 is continuing with the negotiations in good faith with the intent of giving syria a genuine alternative so that it may make the right decision
307865 as if syria asked israel to break off relations with the united states

307887 did not have sufficient grounds to issue an adverse security assessment
307888 expressed a clear view that they did not believe that all relevant elements of the proposed charge could be proven at that time
307889 i was as surprised as anyone when the dpp advised that haneef could be charged because i didnt think the evidence was strong enough
307890 the inquiry will have to resolve the conundrum as to how dr haneef was charged when the agency which charged him the afp and the agency which provided it with legal advice the dpp both thought there was insufficient evidence
307891 a man with no guts who liked people to bow down to him
307892 he was a weak character but he liked to have people worship him

308160 following checks with nvidia management in the us and taiwan it appears that nvidia remains committed to the chipset business and is currently ramping several new products for the intel market we believe nvidia is likely to remain committed to the chipset business approximately 17 of sales as part of its broader platform strategy
308161 going forward we recognize that the ramp of new amd ati offerings may continue to pressure margins and pricing into the september quarter and the december quarter we believe however that nvidia accelerated transition from 65 nm to 55 nm offerings taking place currently may help nvidias cost structure nvidia is expected to continue to release a stream of new offering over the coming months and aims to transition to 40 nm in the first half of 2009 to further help its costs
308162 longer term however we consider that nvidia positioning as a leader in graphics remains solid
308163 initially nvidia supplied chipsets only to amd and has started supplying chipsets for intel cpus as well since q4 2007 over time we have expected sales of chipsets to amd to decline following amds acquisition of chipset and graphics rival ati
308164 we note that nvidia is expected to ramp chipsets with intel motherboard partners such as hp and dell going forward with incremental opportunities at vendors such as apple going forward
308165 this is an exciting time to get my message out to the voters

308211 medical blogs have the opportunity to be such a benefit to patients
308212 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients
308213 its time for us to take some responsibility and really think of how we can maintain the integrity of this process
308214 included sufficient information for patients to identify their doctors or themselves

308225 you would need to consume enormous quantities to affect anything
308226 they dont want anyone to know and i know theyre not proud of it these are people you never would have guessed were smokers i encourage them to quit its that addictive element i understand where theyre coming from
308227 if you cant stop smoking exercise will mitigate some of the effects
308228 when you exercise that improves your cardiovascular function and your hdl cholesterol and generally its just good for you
308229 so if you smoke and exercise youre going to be better off than if you smoke and dont exercise
308230 the balance is going to depend on how much you smoke and how much you exercise but i can tell you unequivocally that people would be better marathoners if they didnt smoke
308231 the industrial solvents that are in cigarette smoke benzene acrolein and then theres the particulate matter and the tars youre bathing cells in industrial grade solvents and its going to reduce oxygen transport
308232 so if you were to take an athlete and have them quit for a week or two and have them do the same run again on the average theyd do better
308233 two cigarettes a day is enough to have adverse cardiovascular effects

308239 mrsa primarily lives on skin and is mostly transmitted by direct touching ive not seen any data that suggests if silver is sprayed onto a surface such as a computer or bedsheet that the risk of mrsa is reduced
308240 the big question with nanosilver is does it behave like regular silver
308241 exposure might not necessarily be a bad thing but i dont know that because ive yet to see a full characterization and assessment of risk
308242 in some studies nanoparticles do not penetrate beyond the top most layer of skin other studies show that nanoparticles can penetrate
308243 were just beginning to understand how nanosilver will interact with living organisms
308244 i would like to see more studies that are directly applicable to human health
308245 were in an era where the development of self sanitizing surfaces would be good
308246 the entire planet is covered quite richly with infectious material
308247 are there things we can do to reduce the burden of infectious matter and frankly does it matter
308248 do i think putting silver on the handle of a household telephone will decrease infection rates the answer is probably not

308254 the lord god formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living being
308255 if humans were entirely different from all other living things or indeed every living thing was entirely different would this reveal the creator to us
308256 certain biochemical capacities are common to all living things so there is even a degree of similarity between the dna of yeast for example and that of human beings because human cells can do many of the same things that yeast can do we share similarities in these dna sequences that code for enzymes and proteins that do these same jobs in both types of cells some of the sequences for example those that code for the histone proteins are almost identical

308334 we cant judge montreal by the first and second years
308335 weve really got to judge this race by its fourth and fifth year because what seems to be happening is every time we do an international deal it loses its luster it starts way up because everyone is real excited then it goes down down down
308336 in the end it makes total sense for the pirates who are planning for next year and beyond and the sox who make at worst a lateral move today and take a huge leap forward for the future but the dodgers are now in the weird position of having three outfielders who deserve to play and two who will feel entitled to play but who suck we can talk about how manny cant field at all but andruw jones has had a historically bad year at the plate and juan pierre has never been a good hitter if l a takes the field with any outfield lineup other than manny matt kemp and andre ethier then we know that theyre not really interested in putting their best team on the field
308337 it really doesnt matter what the reason for the dismissal is its going to look like it was a knee jerk response to the outside the lines piece after all paterno just returned from chicago and the big ten meetings so its not like he could have dismissed the players earlier this week since he doesnt own a computer and cant send text messages

308384 it doha is important not just for global trade and not just for australian trade but it is critically important now to give a shot of confidence to the global economy
308385 the case for global and national action on climate change remains stark
308386 china is the worlds largest coal consuming country australia is the largest coal exporting country
308387 these countries together share a common responsibility to work on to develop and if possible to commercially deploy at scale clean coal technologies that is a core priority of the government i lead
308388 if our objective remains to have a genuinely asia pacific century peaceful and prosperous australian co operation at all levels with china is critical to our success
308389 the economic cost of inaction on climate change now is far greater than the economic cost of action

308440 it should be no surprise that wal mart would stretch the limits of the law in an attempt to deny their workers rights and kill the employee free choice act the company knows what all union workers know workers in unions earn 29 percent higher wages on average are 62 percent more likely to have employer health coverage and four times more likely to have a pension
308441 they tell us they want to do more domestic production
308442 they tell us they need to drill offshore they tell us that they can find oil on the mainland and what do they do with their profits they buy back stock simply to increase their share price
308443 misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence that greenhouse gases are driving climate change
308444 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
308445 personally id like to do another doom movie i thought working with it was a blast
308446 there are some lessons we learned the best way to do things better is to get the experience
308447 well see what happens when we get further along in development of the new doom game and theres more buzz and we share more about what the game will be about
308448 as the buzz meter starts to go up that may kind of kick start the guys over at universal
308449 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped
308450 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
308451 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
308452 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
308453 one need look no further than todays fcc decision for proof that engineering challenges on the internet should be solved by engineers not government officials
308454 in second guessing reasonable network management techniques with no notice or guidelines in place that benefit the overwhelming number of broadband subscribers in america the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
308455 today fcc chairman martin and commissioners adelstein and copps took an important step to preserve the ability of hundreds of millions of users of the internet to access the applications and content of their choice without interference by their broadband providers

308461 although i have tried to resign out of protest i am forced to participate in a war that is manifestly illegal as the order to take part in an illegal act is ultimately unlawful as well i must as an officer of honor and integrity refuse that order

308512 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
308513 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution
308514 which were once so popular that the company couldnt keep pace with demand are now piling up in warehouses
308515 today crocs shoes are available all over the world and on the internet
308516 today ill leave the house wearing these neon green dutch bubble shoes with swiss cheese holes in them maybe ill even buy some little plastic strawberries or bananas and jam them in the sweat holes just to jazz things up and make the bacteria incubate faster

308524 what we have done is to teach the body how to cure this disorder
308525 i could literally give up everything other than my family to have a cure
308526 every single cell in the lettuce leaf contains 10 000 copies of this insulin gene
308527 it is the same insulin that is injected but here what we are doing is instead of injecting it in the blood system we are presenting it to the immune cells and then asking the immune cells to see that this is your own protein
308528 what we have done is to teach the body how to cure this disorder this is a totally new concept a new platform to use this oral delivery system to fix this immune disorder
308529 you dont need to inject this so all of these expenses which are associated with human therapeutic delivery are eliminated using this
308530 we are anticipating the same result as we found in the animal model
308531 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
308532 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
308533 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
308534 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
308535 it took a long time for my family and i to make this important decision we prayed about it and searched our hearts to see if this was the right choice
308536 he kuartei must step down or the president must replace him it is the presidents own policy when he said that his appointee for chief negotiator back in december should not be involved in this years election politics
308537 i recently finished the second floor of my cape cod style house i used the rafter mate product and r 25 along the roof trusses extending the insulation from the soffit into the attic the floors ceiling of the first floor were already insulated between the joists the problem im having is that the hardwood floors near the outside walls are very cold im afraid somehow outside air is entering this space and traveling along the cavity between the second floor and the top of the insulation i did not insulate the vertical knee walls as i thought by insulating the roof and floor it would create a sufficient barrier also with the plumbing located in that area i wanted to insure they would not freeze is there a solution to my problem i will be replacing the siding and soffit later this spring if that will provide access to the problem area
308538 my friend is building a strawbale house the architect specified insulation between the roof rafters as well as on top of the ceiling the attic space is vented at the soffits and ridge and gables my intuition tells me that only the ceiling should be insulated since the attic is vented the house is in a hot summer semi cold winter climate central california any ideas on this
308539 is this product foamular insulation dangerous in a fire ive heard it can release toxic chemicals when ignited
308540 vida com sabor de gra a e da gra a com sabor de vida

308548 us sex offender is coming to preach in the midlands
308549 im not going to condemn it but im not going to encourage people to go along either
308550 if people wish to pray for healing then it is available with the church of england in a more gentle quiet and subtle way
308551 ive known todd for six years and during that time he has been a man of real integrity
308552 he has a chequered history and has written a book about this he was brought up in a trailer park with all that means in america
308553 he was 18 years old when he became a christian and his life completely changed from that point on
308554 ninety days ago he held a healing weekend in florida so many people were cured that the process has continued since then
308555 i went over 10 weeks ago to see what was going on then when i got back to dudley i held a conference with people i knew over the last 10 years and people began to be healed
308556 one woman had a rare form of cancer and god touched her and she became pain free when she visited her doctor she said he told her she was cured
308557 another woman was 70 per cent deaf but after attending the meeting and arriving home she had to turn down the tv because it was too loud
308558 todd does not always kick people to cure them i have only known him to do this on three occasions
308559 most of the healing takes place through him praying and touching them
308560 todd was 13 years old when he abused a child god is not looking for perfect people moses was a murderer
308561 we dont focus on the criticism jesus christ had critics
308562 todd has not kicked anyone during the revival currently taking place in florida its very rare he never does anything like that without first asking for the persons permission

308568 i was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when i suddenly realised there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw although i did not know if it was more complete or not i decided to try and get it out the pieces had to be cleaned separately dried and then glued back together it was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilise it

308573 because the only difference between the two sentences is one of meaningless semantics
308574 we feed upon the thoughts of other minds and thought applied to thought generates more thoughtfulness
308575 about the child hangs as the atmosphere around a planet the thought environment he lives in and here he derives those enduring ideas which express themselves as a life long kinship towards sordid or things lovely things earthly or divine
308576 as we first turned away from god in our thoughts so it is in our thoughts that the first movements toward the renovation of the heart occur thoughts are the place where we can and must begin to change there the light of god first begins to move upon us through the word of christ and there the divine spirit begins to direct our will to more and more thoughts that can provide the basis for choosing to realign ourselves with god and his way
308577 the teachers part is to provide children with a wellspring of right thought to draw from

308592 source port randomization to improve resilience against dns cache poisoning attacks
308593 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the internet protocol weakness
308594 we know with microsoft that there were a few problems even installing their dns patch
308595 now with apple were seeing that the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
308596 the issue is that dns spoofing is a silent killer
308597 you usually wont know until its over and its more complex because it involves coding behind the spoofing and once youre redirected to what looks like a legit site most of the hackers work is done already

308621 but its a big big deal to this team and to us as coaches any time you beat an american team especially at their own game it gets noticed back home
308622 big things can still happen for you if you beat an american team
308623 three hours ago i was so hopeful we would play well
308624 were very disappointed we wanted to go 2 0 against the americans
308625 that and to come over here and play as many different teams as we could it just so happens we drew russia today but it wasnt a matchup we were looking at
308626 but quite frankly i would rather have played belarus today only because we never got a chance to play them this week
308627 they were the best team all week and they were the best team today
308628 we are very very happy we beat the best in europe and now we will try to beat the best in the world

308634 each year it seems there are fewer and fewer 10 run rule games even the lower tier teams are better than in past years
308635 we are all closing the gap on russia a little bit at a time and its not just one or two teams doing it its about a half dozen
308636 we have played two 3 run games in a row and thats a first
308637 what does it all mean hard to say but its obvious that the quality of play throughout europe is getting better

308694 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
308695 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
308696 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
308697 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
308698 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

308706 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
308707 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
308708 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
308709 one need look no further than todays fcc decision for proof that engineering challenges on the internet should be solved by engineers not government officials
308710 in second guessing reasonable network management techniques with no notice or guidelines in place that benefit the overwhelming number of broadband subscribers in america the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
308711 today fcc chairman martin and commissioners adelstein and copps took an important step to preserve the ability of hundreds of millions of users of the internet to access the applications and content of their choice without interference by their broadband providers

308730 as pr ticas da comcast n o s o pouco intrusivas como a empresa argumenta mas sim invasivas e t m efeitos significativos
308731 dito de uma forma simples a comcast abre o correio dos seus clientes porque pretende entregar o correio n o de acordo com o endere o que consta do envelope mas com o tipo de letra que ele contem

308736 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
308737 weve now finally touched it and tasted it from my standpoint it tastes very fine

308749 the scope of what we are doing has never been attempted
308750 its a win for microsoft because anyone who wants to watch the olympics will end up using silverlight it will enable microsoft to install a base of silverlight users but it hasnt been tested on the same scale as flash
308751 when you make a user download something new and it doesnt work well a lot of people will abandon it

308870 we have always maintained a conservative approach to banking by careful planning and by responding aggressively to any emerging problems management and the board of directors are committed to resolving issues in our loan portfolio as quickly as possible as with most banks the bulk of our problem loans are real estate secured of course we cannot predict the future of the real estate market but we believe we have provided enough reserves to resolve the problem loans however we will continue to monitor market conditions and real estate values and take further action if needed
308871 we have received expert unbiased advice about the steps we should take
308872 what this bank and its parent company are now doing and planning to do to address the issues facing capitalsouth are the kind of steps i looked for as a bank regulator
308873 after nearly 40 years in banking i have learned that adverse market conditions impact even good loan portfolios what i want to see from a regulators perspective is that the bank is aggressive in evaluating and managing its loans when market conditions change i was privileged to serve for a time several years ago on the board of the company from this experience i am confident that management and the board of both the bank and the company are determined to protect the interests of both depositors and stockholders

308959 we are concerned that user generated video content on sites such as youtube does not carry any age classification nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be shown
308960 we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users
308961 given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly
308962 we need urgently to find a consensus about the standards of the future standards to help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving world if we are to protect young people

308972 it establishes a baseline of activity and then sends alerts when there are anomalies the big difference is that until now there was no way to do this kind of analysis on video images because the data collected by the cameras wasnt machine readable we had to invent a way to do that
308973 if youre monitoring a busy highway where traffic comes and goes frequently on a regular basis the software learns very quickly
308974 if youre monitoring an outdoor fence line when the camera sees only three or four actions all day it will take longer

309039 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
309040 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there

309047 to be honest i dont think to this day i will ever in my life do an interview with her
309048 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
309049 dottie was a family member to me and i dont even see her as a friend any more
309050 i think that it was a really low blow and highly disappointing really because i think that as a golfer you appreciate golf and what we are doing out here it really affected us in our hearts sherri and i thought it was ridiculous really
309051 it was more of a heart thing than anything else we had a team that was there to support us and pull us out of it i dont think sherri or i will ever look at dottie the same
309052 the way laura has chosen to handle the situation publicly is really disappointing
309053 i hope her heart will at some point recognize the comment was not personal highly emotional and certainly never meant to be heard over the air i have made myself available to her but she has chosen not to talk scream at me or whatever else she feels she needs to do for her peace of mind

309079 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
309080 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
309081 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
309082 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
309083 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
309084 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
309085 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
309086 but i want you to know something this is sincere i want you to know when it comes to believing in god i really tried i really really tried i tried to believe that there is a god who created each of us in his own image and likeness loves us very much and keeps a close eye on things i really tried to believe that but i gotta tell you the longer you live the more you look around the more you realize something is fucked up something is wrong here war disease death destruction hunger filth poverty torture crime corruption and the ice capades something is definitely wrong this is not good work if this is the best god can do i am not impressed results like these do not belong on the r sum of a supreme being this is the kind of shit youd expect from an office temp with a bad attitude and just between you and me in any decently run universe this guy wouldve been out on his all powerful ass a long time ago

309091 it wasnt really even ghosting it was just another novel by me but with someone elses name on the cover
309092 it didnt worry me one way or the other but thats where the problem came because everybody knew it was me but we all then had to pretend otherwise poor naomi came off worse because she was being slammed for something she hadnt really wanted in the first place
309093 why the feck wont my kid sleep through the night child wakes multiple times throughout night
309094 may i follow thee on the footing that thou teach me something of the higher truth which thou hast been taught
309095 verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me
309096 and how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding is not complete
309097 thou wilt find me if allah so will truly patient nor shall i disobey thee in aught
309098 if then thou wouldst follow me ask me no questions about anything until i myself speak to thee concerning it
309099 hast thou scuttled it in order to drown those in it truly a strange thing hast thou done
309100 did i not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me
309101 rebuke me not for forgetting nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my case
309102 hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none truly a foul unheard of thing hast thou done
309103 did i not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me
309104 if ever i ask thee about anything after this keep me not in thy company then wouldst thou have received full excuse from my side
309105 if thou hadst wished surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it
309106 this is the parting between me and thee now will i tell thee the interpretation of those things over which thou wast unable to hold patience
309107 as for the boat it belonged to certain men in dire want they plied on the water i but wished to render it unserviceable for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force
309108 as for the youth his parents were people of faith and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude to allah and man
309109 so we desired that their lord would give them in exchange a son better in purity of conduct and closer in affection
309110 as for the wall it belonged to two youths orphans in the town there was beneath it a buried treasure to which they were entitled their father had been a righteous man so thy lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure a mercy and favour from thy lord i did it not of my own accord such is the interpretation of those things over which thou wast unable to hold patience

309116 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off
309117 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
309118 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

309120 i was trying for a city named minneapolis and got my ticket wrong my head never was that good with names i knew it was cold there and didnt give it much thought until we had to start hunting our own meat and making our own clothes it was so much like back home that i figured something was wrong but thought id study on it for awhile
309121 think i can get my six trained by mid summer this winter training isnt really that bad
309122 but go for it im hoping to get mine done by may if i can
309123 yeah when the weather gets warmer i can speed the training up a bit or at least i hope i can next month will be one year for me rafe was finished in one year i thought i could too but i dont think i will be able to
309124 its more important to do a good job and teach properly than get done quickly
309125 i did need to spend some extra time before winter with melanie and sarah i will just see how the last one goes
309126 monaco is my home town and its my first competition in monaco since ive been living here that motivated me

309129 id like to thank everyone for their support during my career my departure is not the end of the world a lot of prominent players have left spartak but this has never stopped the fans from supporting the team
309130 there isnt a single philosopher in the world who could sum up in just one phrase exactly what titov leaving spartak means
309131 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
309132 coming into this tournament i wasnt sure if i was going to be able to compete
309133 they axiom me on the cmt awards and soon afterward sent me a bunch of razors the next week they instantly became my favorite so it is in reality cool im actually stimulated through it
309134 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
309135 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
309136 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
309137 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
309138 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
309139 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
309140 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
309141 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
309142 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
309143 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

309146 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
309147 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
309148 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
309149 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
309150 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
309151 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
309152 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
309153 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
309154 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
309155 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
309156 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
309157 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
309158 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
309159 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
309160 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
309161 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
309162 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
309163 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
309164 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
309165 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
309166 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
309167 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
309168 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
309169 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
309170 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
309171 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
309172 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
309173 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
309174 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
309175 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
309176 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
309177 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
309178 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
309179 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
309180 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
309181 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
309182 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
309183 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
309184 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
309185 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
309186 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
309187 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
309188 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
309189 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
309190 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
309191 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
309192 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
309193 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
309194 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
309195 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
309196 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
309197 gossip girl has always been more than a television series about its overt subject the social machinations of manhattan private school students
309198 the show has had a profound influence on retail says stephanie solomon fashion director for bloomingdales adding that it appeals not just to teenagers but also to women in their 20s the daughters and younger sisters of the generation that made
309199 may well be the biggest influence in the youth culture market says stephanie meyerson a trend spotter for stylesight a trend forecasting company
309200 gossip girl has been able to profit from its power to generate trends it is not the first show to collect revenues from product tie ins but it probably is the first to have been conceived in part as a fashion marketing vehicle
309201 we tried to launch trends from the get go says eric daman the shows costume designer whose r sum includes a stretch working with patricia field on costumes for
309202 gossip girl influence a trend first seen in february on the new york runways when the series ignited
309203 i like that whole upscale collegiate feeling mixed with a pair of louboutins greenspan says adding that sales at her 8 year old company have doubled in the year since
309204 we probably have 50 percent more of our traffic close to 1 million viewers each month going into gossip girl than into any other show says travis schneider the founder of starbrand media which handles the e commerce connections for the series
309205 i saw how edgy those girls were how forward he says
309206 they wore their school uniforms a little shorter a little tricked out definitely tailored to fit them perfectly and they took liberties through their tights and bags

309220 although theres a lot of respect for what ive achieved my oval experience is not huge and even though there was the indy 500 win in 1995 ultimately what people want to know is how youd do in a 36 race season how you do on the ovals and are you still hungry enough to do it
309221 a good showing would help with the sponsors but it wont have any effect on the teams because this is a road course
309222 we had a good race last year but you can tell the level of competition has stepped up
309223 im confident weve got a good crew here and a good car unfortunately most nascar races are like the last two minutes of overtime in hockey it gets out of control if theres a caution with 10 minutes to go cautions breed cautions theres going to be a lot of contact thats what caught us out last year we need to avoid that

309330 has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama t hese baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
309331 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
309332 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
309333 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
309334 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
309335 included some assertions from the mccain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading
309336 i have become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
309337 before the operation we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact hed have somebody elses hands

309339 already the number of donors willing to donate their internal organs is declining
309340 on top of that it is more acceptable for people to have a relatives kidneys taken out than for them to have an entire leg hand or their face cut off
309341 wow you can see the perfect image by just shooting around
309342 yes i promised bulk update no this isnt more than one page dx schooooooool issh soooooow stoopid
309343 the announcements are accurate but i think they lack context in other words great theyre going down the number of new infections but this could be due to the fact that the earlier estimate wasnt good or that some aspect of the prevention campaigns is working but the failure to provide a context for the figures could lead people to stop protecting themselves
309344 we are not going to achieve universal coverage of antiretroviral treatment by 2010

309349 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments

309355 well honey when you get to the market go one mile further to the church and turn south one mile then
309356 we heard for years and years that we were producing too much and now thats changing its a turn around for farming in europe and i think its a big improvement for us
309357 basically what we are seeing is a big drive towards intensification which will put huge strains on the environment
309358 set aside has been abolished with hardly any thought to the implications we are predicting a threat to many wild species biodiversity will feel the heat from this
309359 one of the most important issues will be water quality we are already facing very severe ground water and river pollution problems in europes most heavily cultivated regions
309360 what we are saying is that when you take set aside away you need to replace it with a targeted scheme which will keep its environmental benefits or face the consequences
309361 the whole philosophy now is to free farmers to follow the market and not just chase after the biggest subsidy from brussels
309362 we are asked to deliver food for reasonable prices and at the same time we are asked to maintain biodiversity
309363 and its a difficult question should we do the biodiversity thing or should we respond to the market requirements i dont think we can do both
309364 the main issue over the last one or two years is the high food prices internationally and if we didnt respond to that by producing more then the accusations against farmers would be more serious
309365 there is definitely no doubt that the drive is on at the moment to produce more
309366 ive been following agricultural policy and its the sort of subject that stops dinner parties in their tracks
309367 suddenly its on the front pages and everyone is crucially interested in how farming affects what theyre paying in the supermarkets
309368 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
309369 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
309370 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
309371 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
309372 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
309373 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
309374 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
309375 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
309376 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
309377 we will ask if we can carry our canoes out to sea across the pontoon on the marina
309378 its not that dangerous as long as nobody submerges in the water for too long
309379 i urge congressman broun to thoroughly review spending bills before rejecting them outright
309380 fiscal responsibility requires a common sense approach that never trumps safety for our citizens
309381 ag commissioner tommy irvin is old and senile and forgot he endorsed me
309382 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
309383 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
309384 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
309385 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
309386 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
309387 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
309388 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
309389 ten a previsto vender el banco de venezuela a un grupo inversor privado venezolano a cuyo fin se alcanzaron determinados compromisos sin que finalmente se llegara a acordar la compraventa

309429 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
309430 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
309431 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
309432 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
309433 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
309434 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
309435 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
309436 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
309437 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
309438 in search of winning a that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
309439 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
309440 having a manager who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
309441 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
309442 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
309443 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
309444 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
309445 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
309446 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
309447 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
309448 weaving on the go build your very own lap loom and warp it too
309449 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
309450 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
309451 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
309452 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
309453 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
309454 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
309455 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
309456 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
309457 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
309458 ill never fill up my hard drive i hardly ever download videos or games
309459 the situation at aol is completely different with bloggers allegedly being asked to not post or post without pay and no clue whats going on with their blogs many of which are very well read
309460 unless you talked directly to me and heard directly from me why i resigned then facts were most certainly not checked no one speaks for me
309461 we heard for years and years that we were producing too much and now thats changing its a turn around for farming in europe and i think its a big improvement for us
309462 basically what we are seeing is a big drive towards intensification which will put huge strains on the environment
309463 set aside has been abolished with hardly any thought to the implications we are predicting a threat to many wild species biodiversity will feel the heat from this
309464 one of the most important issues will be water quality we are already facing very severe ground water and river pollution problems in europes most heavily cultivated regions
309465 what we are saying is that when you take set aside away you need to replace it with a targeted scheme which will keep its environmental benefits or face the consequences
309466 the whole philosophy now is to free farmers to follow the market and not just chase after the biggest subsidy from brussels
309467 we are asked to deliver food for reasonable prices and at the same time we are asked to maintain biodiversity
309468 and its a difficult question should we do the biodiversity thing or should we respond to the market requirements i dont think we can do both
309469 the main issue over the last one or two years is the high food prices internationally and if we didnt respond to that by producing more then the accusations against farmers would be more serious
309470 there is definitely no doubt that the drive is on at the moment to produce more
309471 ive been following agricultural policy and its the sort of subject that stops dinner parties in their tracks
309472 suddenly its on the front pages and everyone is crucially interested in how farming affects what theyre paying in the supermarkets
309473 dauuummmm my parents sure did a good job on me

309478 he who works in marble and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone is nobler than he who ploughs the soil and he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet
309479 beauty is kind and gentle like a young mother half shy of her own glory she walks among us
309480 nay beauty is a thing of might and dread like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us
309481 beauty is of soft whisperings she speaks in our spirit her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow
309482 we have heard her shouting among the mountains and with her cries came the sound of hoofs and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions
309483 we have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset
309484 she shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills
309485 we have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves and we saw a drift of snow in her hair

309491 i think you are great for my friend but i am afraid you may hurt him please dont hurt him he doesnt need that at this point in his life keep smiling for now and making him happy if the day ever does come though that you have to end it remember how much you care about him right now

309507 over time this will transform the structure of the industry itself
309508 this trend points up an increasing interest in the opportunity for the cloud to be a commercial enterprise
309509 as time goes on ibm sees that there is going to be increasing demand for cloud style computing
309510 the goal in all this is to provide businesses with access to applications and processes in a way thats as easy seamless and user friendly as using the web today
309511 eventually that was undermined by the cost efficiencies of centralized power generation

309516 we are trying to get peace or happiness from outside from money or power but real peace tranquility should come from within
309517 understanding and compassion are very powerful sources of energy they are the opposite of stupidity and passivity if you think that compassionate people do not resist and challenge injustice you are wrong they are warriors heroes and heroines who have gained many victories when you act with compassion with non violence when you act on the basis of non duality you have to be very strong you no longer act out of anger you do not punish or blame compassion grows constantly inside of you and you can succeed in your fight against injustice mahatma gandhi was just one person he did not have any bombs any guns or any political party he acted simply on the insight of non duality the strength of compassion not on the basis of anger

309524 as is the case with gary brown ira todd was prevented from doing his job
309525 we dont even know if the drug dealers allegations about a relationship with the mayor are true the point is todd was not allowed to investigate the matter and its the interference with these investigations of the mayor which leads some people to believe there may be truth in the allegations
309526 todd talked to a police sergeant in lexington who told him nemo had a brother named james davis who lived in the area
309527 the sergeant told todd that james davis was the target of an investigation into drug dealing and mortgage fraud
309528 a few days after making the report todd said he was told by his supervisors to take his vacation immediately
309529 youd think after investigating this hit man and finding out that he was involved in 10 murders that todd would be a hero in the police department
309530 but only if the top supervisors in the department were satisfied he would do nothing to further assist the lexington police department in its investigation of james davis or follow up on the reported connection between mayor kilpatrick and james davis
309531 todds supervisors realized mayor kilpatrick would be extremely angered if todds report about information linking the mayor to james davis were investigated by todd or if the information were to become public
309532 he overturned the tables and seats moreover he would not permit anyone to carry things through the temple area
309533 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
309534 i marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be accursed
309535 but as we apostles were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which tries our hearts
309536 behold i will send my messenger john the baptist and he shall prepare the way before me christ and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in
309537 of the gospel not the message itself and his message is actually the very core the
309538 the law and the prophets were until john only old testament scriptures had been preached previously
309539 and he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
309540 i have gone preaching the kingdom of god repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
309541 and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ
309542 but when they believed philip concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
309543 for if he that comes preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him
309544 paul wanted the corinthians to reject false teachers and hold to what
309545 how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day
309546 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ
309547 hearken my beloved brethren has not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him
309548 repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
309549 god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
309550 in you shall all families of the earth be blessed
309551 for unto us was the gospel preached acts 3 show that this included the period all the way up to and through samuel
309552 yes and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
309553 all gods prophets as many as have spoken foretold of these days
309554 for you god shall judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth
309555 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the
309556 behold the days come says the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness
309557 for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land
309558 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever
309559 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people
309560 then he called his twelve disciples together and he sent them to preach the
309561 is this a different second gospel regarding paul we could ask on the other hand did he forget about
309562 for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak
309563 the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
309564 the law and the prophets were preached until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached
309565 that he might be the rom 8 29 when connected these two verses show that christ is the firstborn from the dead and that many others will follow later but
309566 verily verily this means truly truly i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
309567 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
309568 the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
309569 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
309570 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
309571 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
309572 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed
309573 but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever
309574 until the ancient of days christ here and the father in verse 13 came and judgment was given to the
309575 and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions rulers shall serve and obey him
309576 and he that overcomes to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron
309577 and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the
309578 its about time that someone speaks out in this world and tells the world that the very gospel of jesus christ was the advance announcement of this very world government a government not by selfishly motivated man but by the living all powerful god
309579 jesus christs message his gospel was the kingdom of god the government of the living god
309580 when the messiah returns with all the power of god we shall have
309581 that is the true gospel proclaimed in all the world

309609 remember the first day the pagan suns day to keep it holy
309610 for signs and for seasons and for days and years
309611 six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the
309612 these are the l ord even holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their seasons
309613 in the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the l
309614 and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the l ord seven days you must eat unleavened bread in the seventh day is an holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein
309615 and you shall proclaim on the selfsame day that it may be an holy convocation unto you you shall do no servile work therein it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations
309616 in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of
309617 also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
309618 speak unto the children of israel saying the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the l first day shall be an holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein
309619 and you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees branches of palm trees and the boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the l ord your god seven days and you shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year it shall be a statute forever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month you shall dwell in booths temporary dwellings seven days all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths that your generations may know that i god made the children of israel to dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the l ord your god
309620 moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them
309621 this is he that was in the church in the wilderness and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us
309622 this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you
309623 pass through the land of egypt this night and smite all the firstborn
309624 strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning
309625 keep the passover unto the l ord your god for in the month of abib the l ord your god brought you forth out of egypt by night
309626 and they departed from rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the egyptians
309627 even the selfsame day the 15th it came to pass that all the hosts of the l
309628 and in the fourteenth day of the first month is the fifteenth day of this month is the feast
309629 for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance forever
309630 and moses said unto the people remember this day 15th in which you came out from egypt out of the house of ex 13 3 this verse sets the stage
309631 seven days you shall eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the l
309632 your glorying is not good know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven physical leaven that you the christian may be a new lump as you the christian are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven physical leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness spiritual leaven but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
309633 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy forgiveness for sins already committed and find grace to help to overcome temptation for any future sin in time of need
309634 and when pharaoh drew near the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the l
309635 fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the lord for the egyptians you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you
309636 and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them
309637 and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
309638 i have these offerings that must take place i better create the holy days so that people will have a set time to do them
309639 but now after that you have known god or rather are known of god how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto you desire again to be in bondage you observe days and months and times and years
309640 unlawful for judicial and business matters on which the state expected the citizenry to abstain as far as possible from their private business and labor
309641 and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days
309642 you shall therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year
309643 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
309644 these days are not were a fore shadow of things to come
309645 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
309646 but you shall be baptized with the holy spirit not many days hence
309647 commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father
309648 judgment must i pet 4 17 so god is only doing this now
309649 the vs 4 more of this later but these are very specific
309650 jesus said unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god
309651 and you shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall you number fifty days
309652 why count just fifty days why not forty sixty or seventy
309653 the boethusians say the cutting of the sheaf does not take place at the end of the day of the feast first day of unleavened bread but only at the end of the next regular sabbath
309654 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy the seventh day is the sabbath of the
309655 the morrow after the seventh sabbath shabbat meaning sabbath day
309656 seven weeks shall you number unto you begin to number the
309657 after your weeks be out you shall have an holy convocation you shall do no servile work
309658 after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up that the residue remainder of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called says the lord who does all these things
309659 and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion zion the deliverer the soon coming jesus christ and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob
309660 for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in
309661 no man can come to me except the father draw him
309662 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time the first time was the exodus from egypt to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea
309663 all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion
309664 and all dominions rulers shall serve and obey him christ
309665 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it christ is the root of jesse shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious
309666 and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the l
309667 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the l
309668 one man esteems one day above another another esteems every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regards the day regards it unto the lord and he that regards not the day to the lord he does not regard it he that eats eats to the lord for he gives god thanks and he that eats not to the lord he eats not and gives god thanks
309669 the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day
309670 who are you that judges another mans servant to his own master he stands or falls yes he shall be helped up for rom 14 4
309671 the holy scriptures are able to make you wise unto salvation
309672 as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commends us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse
309673 then again this man rates one day above another while that man rates all days alike well everyone must be convinced in his own mind the man who values a particular day does so to the lord the eater eats to the lord since he thanks god for his food the non eater abstains to the lord and he too thanks god
309674 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
309675 and the seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped god saying we give you thanks o lord god almighty which are and was and are to come because you have taken to you your great power and have reigned and the nations were angry and your wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that you should give reward unto your servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear your name small and great and should destroy them which destroy the earth and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail
309676 and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the l ord in the holy mount at jerusalem
309677 and he the high priest shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering
309678 shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house
309679 and he shall take the two goats and present them before the l ord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and aaron shall other lot for the scapegoat
309680 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
309681 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which enters into that within the veil where the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a
309682 and when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the live goat and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make an atonement for himself and for the people and he that let go the goat for the azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water and afterward come into the camp
309683 now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because
309684 and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days
309685 you shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine and you shall rejoice in your feast you and your son and your daughter and your manservant and your maidservant and the levite the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within your gates seven days shall you keep a solemn feast unto the l ord your god in the place which the l ord your god shall bless you in all your increase and in all the works of your hands therefore you shall surely rejoice three times in a year shall all your males appear before the l ord your god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before the l ord empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the l ord your god which he has given you
309686 and you shall observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years end
309687 and the l ord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one l ord and his name one and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter destruction but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited

309693 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption
309694 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
309695 this eighth day which immediately follows the seven days of the feast of tabernacles pictures the completion of the plan of redemption it is just prior to the new heaven and the new earth all parents and children young and old will be resurrected
309696 notice that the book of life typifying salvation is opened

309698 christmas new years easter and a host of others are the holidays that have come directly from paganism but these seven annual holy days are the holy days of god let us forsake the pagan holidays of this world and observe the true holy days of god
309699 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose you shall he be thought worthy who has trodden under foot the son of god and has counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and has done despite unto the spirit of grace

309804 this 2008 season has been a particularly busy one for the yacht club costa smeralda
309805 we had six events back to back in may and june alone including two world championships now the traditional big september events are just around the corner and we are raring to go the fleet of maxis lining up for this edition is truly spectacular and no sooner will they claim their prizes than the swans will be here for their biennial gathering and another world championship it will be another challenging and exciting time for us
309806 we are still going to have to position ourselves well to round the brittany point because the playing field is going to be very open
309807 this is what the others are going to be saying to themselves to get motivated and attack me

309811 the european championship is over now it is time to look ahead to different challenges with liverpool its 19 years since we won the league its time to end that wait now i at least have to aim to equal last years figure 33 goals
309812 whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa not me when he signed keane i imagine he had a clear idea of where he wanted to play him
309813 i was delighted to get that game under my belt i have been dreaming about that moment since i was a kid cant wait to play more with stevie gerrard he is world class and able to spot passes that maybe others dont see he created a chance for me which maybe i should have done a bit better with we linked up well
309814 plug the new shirt cos its in the shops competition
309815 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
309816 the lovely warm feeling of satisfaction resulting from enthusiastic reviews
309817 ive been really impressed with the mls and how its improving ive been really impressed by the teams weve played here and the way the facilities have improved as well the stadiums are particularly impressive and i have to say this is the finest pitch ive seen in america
309818 if were going to go to talk to the american worker and say were looking out for their interests to automatically dismiss the idea that its possible to drill in the ocs in a way that will be environmentally safe i think that will harm us politically
309819 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
309820 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem

309828 ciencia o arte da lo mismo ambas consisten en el estudio de la vida
309829 es un proyecto dif cil que trata un tema no a priori comercial aunque pueda afectarnos a todos ser una pel cula que dar mucho que hablar
309830 mis referencias han sido sobre todo como espectador no como actor
309831 uno siempre aprende de los rodajes en los que participa y de los directores con los que trabaja pero a la hora de crear una pel cula como cualquier obra que tiene que ver con lo humano uno tiene que partir de la gente que tiene alrededor de uno mismo y de las sensaciones que uno puede captar no tanto en la obra de otros sino en la propia realidad porque partiendo de ah uno puede dar realmente algo particular e innovador
309832 es conseguir contar algo que nadie m s puede contar como t ya no se trata de ser mejor o peor se trata de que no hay nadie m s que pueda contar eso como t lo cuentas se trata de tener un lugar en el mundo que nadie te pueda quitar
309833 pedro es un director fant stico porque todo lo trabaja l se entrega al m ximo ni duerme ni come ni nada es una pasi n por su trabajo impresionante
309834 tiene en com n con estos grandes directores en que los tres han hecho una obra propia personal su visi n del mundo y eso no hay mucha gente que lo pueda hacer hay miles de personas que podr an hacer una pel cula de acci n pero hacer una pel cula como las de almod var s lo la puede hacer almod var
309835 he rechazado trabajos importantes incluida una pel cula en estados unidos para dedicar m s tiempo a dirigir
309836 he rechazado trabajos tan importantes que mi representante me quer a matar incluida una pel cula en estados unidos y otros papeles que no he hecho yo y han hecho otros y esto siempre al final cuando vuelves te obliga a recuperar un terreno perdido y no tengo tiempo ahora mismo para recuperar ese terreno perdido
309837 no es que rechace actuar me encanta pero s que a veces hay que tomar opciones ahora tengo una nueva forma de trabajar que es la direcci n
309838 de todas maneras actuar es un trabajo que me encanta y que no pienso dejar prefiero hacer pocas pel culas pero que me sienta orgulloso de ellas a lanzarme a hacer pel culas aqu y all tengo 30 a os y mucho tiempo por delante para dedicarme a actuar
309839 quiz en la quinta sexta o s ptima act e en ellas de momento no me siento capacitado m s que para dirigir que ya es bastante trabajo
309840 nada realmente nadie me dijo nada aquello fue un abandono moral absoluto
309841 como es l gico si uno tiene talento para lo art stico y ha nacido en una familia de artistas pues mira qu bien hay un trocito menos que tiene que recorrer en el sentido de que no va a tener que convencer a su familia de que se puede vivir de eso porque ya est n convencidos
309842 de donde yo vengo no hay dinero ni comida ni agua pero hay calor humano si alguien est en la calle yo lo recojo le doy cama y algo para la boca en espa a la gente muere sola y en la calle
309843 tuve que dormir en la calle hasta que un hombre en la misma situaci n me ayud
309844 los conoc en verano y no los he vuelto a ver no me reconocen y llaman pap a su hermano mayor
309845 ten amos una casa grande pero nos la quitaron y ahora dormimos donde antes estaban los animales
309846 las ongs aparecen pero su ayuda es m s simb lica que efectiva a mi hijo lo dejaron morir en la carretera
309847 ocurri todo el verano del a o pasado el peque o ten a cinco a os y se call a un pozo cuando su madre buscaba agua el pozo no era grande pero no pudo sacarlo y tuvo que dejarlo all media hora cuando unos hombres lo sacaron y lo llevaron al poblado donde estaban los m dicos no pudieron ayudarlo porque estaba muy grave y su cuerpo tan peque o no cab a en el coche que iba a salir hacia dakar todos eran m dicos y nadie le dej un sitio porque hu an de la tormenta ten an miedo su madre se lo llev a casa diez kil metros cargando con l y se lo dej a al que se lo llev la misma noche
309848 mi mujer le llor m s porque le ve a todos los d as y yo casi no lo conoc
309849 hablamos casi todas las semanas cuando mi mujer no est enferma anda muchos kil metros para o r mi voz
309850 all las mujeres con sida son quitadas de la sociedad ning n marido las quiere porque es algo deshonesto por eso se calla y la gente se sigue enfermando
309851 a mi mujer le mando bragas porque alli es el marido quien las compra y est muy mal visto que ella las compre a mis hijas a veces tambi n
309852 porque este lo pone todo m s dif cil y cada vez hay m s papeles que rellenar para viajar y hasta para ir al m dico demasiados papeles
309853 los derechos fundamentales los valores democr ticos y los principios constitucionales como el honor la intimidad y el respeto a la privacidad
309854 que a lo largo de la historia siempre se ha descrito a la sociedad del momento como una sociedad cr tica en decadencia
309855 los conformistas que no defienden sus derechos s lo podr n ser libres por los esfuerzos de personas mucho mejores que ellas
309856 se habla de que espa a se est desertizando pero es mentira
309857 el nico punto en espa a que tiene datos fiables diarios de temperatura y lluvia es gibraltar
309858 si a un amigo no le dejas solo y lo apoyas m s cuando m s lo necesita debes hacer lo mismo contigo mismo
309859 hay muchos pa ses interesados en que adopte su nacionalidad y les represente
309860 yo que le debo a espa a pues cero nada he sido campe n del mundo pese a ser espa ol
309861 he sido campe n del mundo pese a ser espa ol
309862 esto demuestra que mis t cnicas funcionan con todo el mundo
309863 siguiendo este m todo en poco tiempo dominas un idioma
309864 la forma m s inteligente de ser inteligente es la bondad
309865 si dos personas tienen siempre la misma opini n puedo asegurar que una de ellas piensa por las dos
309866 listen we ought to call our pal and let him know that we care
309867 mi meta es tener el tiempo ocupado y estar con gente para no dejar que mi mente fluya sola de esta manera evito mis crisis
309868 ayer por ejemplo empec a pensar que juan me hab a olvidado l estaba con sus amigos y como no me llamaba pens que todo hab a acabado y borr su n mero de tel fono cuando pude hablar con l me tranquiliz y se me pas todo
309869 pienso que no sirvo que soy incapaz y la nica salida que encuentro es abandonar la carrera
309870 primero voy al ba o luego me pongo crema en los brazos y las piernas voy a por un vaso de agua que coloco en la mesita me tomo la medicaci n y apago la luz dos veces
309871 me los tomaba para todo se los robaba a mi madre porque depend a de ellos psicol gicamente cada vez necesitaba m s y dejaron de hacerme efecto
309872 no entend a nada de lo que me rodeaba y no me encontraba a m misma
309873 visit primero a un psic logo pero no sirvi para nada luego encontr a un psiquiatra privado que me recet una medicaci n para caballos
309874 no era consciente de lo que me estaba tomando me sent a impotente y desesperada y la nica alternativa fue ponerme en sus manos
309875 estaba como en otro mundo me sent a flotar fuera de mi cuerpo consegu olvidarme de que exist a
309876 muy pocas personas se conocen y se aceptan casi nadie es coherente consigo mismo pero lo que s es cierto es que durante esos dos meses dej de preocuparme por intentar saber qui n era
309877 me recet otros f rmacos m s adecuados a mi problema y me puso en las manos de una psicoanalista
309878 el s ndrome de abstinencia fue terrible dej de comer y de salir me encontraba peor que nunca y parec a que aquella situaci n iba a durar siempre
309879 me analiza mi problema de discontinuidad temporal la distorsi n de la realidad mis rituales antes de dormir el asco por la comida la obsesi n por la higiene
309880 los f rmacos no solucionan nada son nicamente un complemento a la psicoterapia
309881 es algo que ya forma parte de m al principio me daba miedo depender de ellas pero ahora ya no la medicaci n es una droga m s y no pasa nada al final todo el mundo est enganchado a algo y por lo menos yo estoy controlada por un especialista
309882 una mala racha o un estado an mico bajo situaciones por las que atravesamos todos los seres humanos ya no se toleran
309883 aunque se esconde socialmente la gente se permite a s misma m s que antes acudir a una consulta
309884 cada vez son m s los chicos de 12 o 13 a os que beben hasta la borrachera todos los fines de semana
309885 me enroll con chicos que ni conoc a dije mentiras incre bles como que mis padres me maltrataban y mis amigas terminaron enfad ndose conmigo
309886 eso no era lo m o yo quer a ver a un psiquiatra porque necesitaba medicaci n
309887 si tomaba todas las pastillas me quedaba dormida estaba muy tranquila pero era una sensaci n demasiado artificial
309888 mezclaba diferentes clases de tranquilizantes y somn feros no me importaba morirme
309889 conoc a ngel mi compa ero sentimental y ya estoy bien no las necesito
309890 no recuerdo nada me llevaron al hospital y me pincharon la b12 otra vez
309891 no creo que nadie necesite un psiquiatra la gente lo que desea es que la escuchen de verdad mientras persista esa necesidad los psic logos seguir n ganando 50 euros la hora
309892 si no tienes a nadie con quien poder hablar y desahogarte terminas por recurrir a la nica alternativa que te queda
309893 hoy en d a los f rmacos se toleran mejor y tienen muchos menos efectos secundarios el nico problema es el de la adicci n
309894 muchos de ellos presionan para que se le medique buscan la soluci n en dos semanas mediante un f rmaco
309895 en la seguridad social la lista de espera para ver a un psiquiatra es de varios meses y el tiempo por cada paciente es de 15 minutos aunque nosotros tambi n recibimos formaci n psicol gica en un cuarto de hora no se puede realizar una terapia
309896 yo ya no me veo sin las pastillas forman parte de m
309897 en el fondo estamos solos en un desierto de gente
309898 cuando has abierto la caja de pandora ya no hay march atr s
309899 as me comunica me queda el consuelo de que no creer n patochadas de un cualquiera lo siento porque era m s una pose radical de ni o malo y no quiero que se le tome demasiado en serio tampoco lo merece por otra parte
309900 en los peri dicos siempre me ha parecido atractiva la secci n
309901 lo siento por todo aquel al que mis comentarios han herido tanto como los del entrevistado me hirieron a mi y en mi defensa dir que en lo personal no tengo nada contra nadie ni de esta p gina ni de ninguna mis comentarios se limitan a lo estrictamente literario y a los personajes que son ficticios siempre en mayor o menor medida no tengo intenci n ni he tenido de entrar en lo personal que me he equivocado es cierto perd n y excusas p blicas

309913 i believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth
309914 on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
309915 just because the ua didnt make those lists doesnt mean great things arent happening there
309916 to be included at all in the book there has to be academic excellence at the school a strong admissions office lots of things
309917 theres a lot of schools that arent on any of the top 20 lists its nothing to hang your head about
309918 theyre entitled to their own opinion but i think we have the tastiest food the only thing this shows is that people were too busy enjoying our great food and amazing campus life to fill out a survey for the princeton review
309919 i think that goes to the nature of the size of asu and on the heels of quite a few athletic wins
309920 winning games goes hand in hand with partying but at ua we try to be the best for academics and outreach i have the utmost confidence in president robert shelton that even if we dont make the princeton review the quality of education and student life here at ua will remain high
309921 although its nice to be listed among the top 386 universities our aspirations are much higher
309922 you could look at various college rankings and get various results our priorities need to be about our mission of education research and outreach
309923 how many people could be fed with the money this thing cost
309924 su existencia jam s ha sido comprobada de manera emp rica por arte o ciencia alguna
309925 the atmosphere and environment of incommunicado interrogation as it exists today is inherently intimidating and works to undermine the privilege against self incrimination
309926 these searches are not voluntary because people feel compelled to assent
309927 that is the product of official intimidation or harassment is not consent at all
309928 an articulable suspicion that the search will yield evidence of illegal activity
309929 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
309930 im able to pinch hit the next three nights and catch in an emergency

309934 next thing i knew i had lettuce and arugula all winter long
309935 individual clients are so happy to be started off with a design they dont have time to put in the garden so i do it for them and then they take over it takes gardening back to the family
309936 i brought in some peas still in the pod and a student asked me what they were
309937 i realized that even culinary students dont always know where real food comes from but theyll try to impress you by taking food and turning it into something its not
309938 i take them lettuce and squash and they share their persimmons dewberries and pears i tell my students food is the purest expression of love whether youre pulling it out of the ground or the saut pan
309939 and my garden is survival of the fittest kind of an experiment if i do something that works i tell my clients on the other hand one of the tomatoes i grew this year was green sausage and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone
309940 honestly it might be easier to grow vegetables in a rectangular plot
309941 but im not much of a rectangle person perfection is overrated and boring i like to mix things in
309942 but pests dont like it so i plant a lot
309943 im reworking the soil and putting in greens for fall
309944 wed love to have more exclusive hits on our box absolutely are we investing in that yes we are does that take a lot of time yes it does
309945 speaking at quakecon 2008 in dallas this week id software co founder carmack praised apples iphone as an emerging force in mobile gaming industry and revealed his firm to be working on two titles for the handset
309946 the mou if required would be produced before the court by smt kokilaben mother of the ambani brothers
309947 its a private document between the ambani brothers besides broad framework of the demerger it also has the details of the division of the personal assets of ambani family
309948 its a piece of trash as far as this case in concerned
309949 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
309950 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
309951 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
309952 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
309953 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
309954 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
309955 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
309956 we were doing a blog and it really was all about how things were going in the minor leagues because there was not too much coverage about it how my outings went and stuff
309957 but obviously thats not the case any more were just going to wait until the off season and start talking about whats going on some trips and stuff like that were just taking it easy right now
309958 there was something printed in a paper early someone told me and something got up on the site for a little bit
309959 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
309960 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
309961 i know its not the best era in the league but theres two months left in the season and ive got 10 wins
309962 he could keep the money i dont need that i want to continue to pitch and help the team make the playoffs
309963 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
309964 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
309965 ill never fill up my hard drive i hardly ever download videos or games
309966 so whats the deal with these xbox 360 prices i tell ya im beginning to think theyre emo since they keep cuttin themselves take this ars technica see hes the one who lets em in on industry see grits but they cant tell us who he is due to a blinding contract his latest piece o dirt is that the xbox 360 is goin down in september thats 399 for the elite 299 for the 60 gigger and 199 for the arcade man im so confused by all these models they keep explainin them to me and i gotta keep asking skuse me
309967 how to do extrememe macro photography without a dedicated lens video
309968 ive come here with a big price tag and i just wanted to get off to a good start and hit the ground running to be honest
309969 i havent been playing many games so it was tough getting back into the swing of things but i was delighted to get a goal i loved every minute of it
309970 weve signed a lot of good players this summer so its going to be a good season
309971 everyone is gelling well weve been tracking bents bentley for some time and now weve got him hes only going to help the team if he produces chances and scores like he has done today
309972 if you pass the ball like them spurs it doesnt matter what tactics you use
309973 if you take that down to five or six then wed have had the ball about eight minutes longer
309974 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
309975 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality
309976 we dont need money to buy someone but its not just to buy it has to be the right person that is at the moment very difficult
309977 its not a problem because we have enough young players who can step in
309978 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
309979 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
309980 at the time the players in front of bentley like ljungberg and robert pires were better than him
309981 he wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role and i felt at the time he was not ready he would be more ready today
309982 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him
309983 the fact that bentley is now a national team player proves it was the right decision we deserve praise because we were not stupid and keep the player in the reserves
309984 at youth level you are working 90 for other clubs some players who are just a little bit short for you go somewhere else but you have an influence on their development
309985 when you have an academy of our quality not every player can make it
309986 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
309987 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
309988 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
309989 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
309990 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
309991 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
309992 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
309993 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
309994 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
309995 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
309996 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
309997 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
309998 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
309999 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
