8350000 some of us have seen right through the fake exterior from day one
8350001 no one i know in west virginia will vote for a black man
8350002 why do people assume that people dont listen i am listening ive been listening to him since he ran for sentator in illinois
8350003 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8350004 but now everyone knows hope and change and hope and change
8350005 no one i know in west virginia will vote for a black man
8350006 ah such a forum of the under informed biased and prejudices aspects of our society
8350007 i have a challenge for all those clinton supporters that say theyll vote for mccain or will not vote at all go to mccain rallies literally cheer him on applaud when his fellow republicans applaud really listen to his message and embrace it consider yourself part of his team
8350008 at least bill clinton balanced the budget and worked with republicans you wont see that with obama
8350009 we live in the greatest country in the world help me change it
8350010 sorry for that but you know politics better than anyone how about the four of us play a round of golf and have dinner and drinks
8350011 look im in this to win and i need 90 of the black vote and im never going to put up your numbers hillary with the latino community
8350012 and obama and clinton are not that much alike for example obamas treated hillary with a lot of respect
8350013 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
8350014 there are so many reasons to hate other people why choose skin color
8350015 black people always play the race card when things arent going their way
8350016 ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and a way that bill clinton did not
8350017 obama is a socialist with ties to radical leftists and terrorists he is admired in the middle east but disliked in new york city
8350018 unfortunately the platforms of the democratic party are being missed due to the media fixation on the
8350019 what will hillary say will she unite the party will bill stay on script
8350020 it also cant be simply a matter of simple agreement with the idea for the same reason also none of this comes with any idea or need for a polich change
8350021 thats simply a statement of your opinion backed by nothing
8350022 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

8350101 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest
8350102 the work does certainly indicate that the ice sheet is sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
8350103 the answer is most likely related to the fact that underneath the ice on greenland are some high altitude mountains on the east coast which are high enough to be cold enough that ice can form which then flows slowly down the slopes and eventually covers the entire island
8350104 in certain time periods for example about 20 000 years ago when the earths orbit is aligned in a certain way ice does start to form in canada and siberia for example in the
8350105 i was born and raised in the state of indiana in the city of indianapolis i grew up on the west side of the town growing up i was like any child and i liked to play games and i stayed out in the streets until the lights came on i was not a tough guy i was just really rough to the best of my knowledge i never went around trying to pick on people i just liked to be happy live and let live was pretty much how i lived my life back then and to this day i am pretty much the same
8350106 i got into boxing because it was something that i used to see my father and his friends spend a lot of time watching they all watched around the tv and they put a lot of time and energy towards watching i was drawn to it because i wanted that attention and i think every boy wants that same type of attention from his father i think once i really got into the sport i realized that boxing chose me more so because it kept drawing me back i never really wanted to get punched in the face and i never really wanted to punch anybody but there was just a dog in me that was always ready to come out i didnt even know what it was but i answered the call and i stepped forward with my best foot and here i am
8350107 its going to be an interesting fight for me i havent been in the ring for over a year and im looking forward to coming back i have a game opponent in danny batchelder and im excited to be fighting in the tri state area ohio is right on the border of my home of indiana and its almost like a welcome home return type of fight for me im going to go out there and put on a great show and put the rest in gods hands
8350108 my kids have kept me busy i have been fighting since i was seven years old and i just needed a break i needed some time off to figure out where i was at in life and what i really wanted it was almost like a sabbatical for me ive taken that time and i feel that the call of the wild as it pertains to boxing has told me to answer the call this is where my heart still is and i know i still got it i feel like i am still the best fighter out there but due to all the frustrations and injuries that i have had it has taken some time for me to get back again but everything is alright for me and im ready to show the world that i am 100 if anybody gave up on me that is their fault
8350109 it depends on the type of person you are not really the type of fighter i understand that all the greatest fighters in the world have lost fights in many ways you havent even been tested unless you have lost a fight from joe louis to jack johnson to jack dempsey and from muhammad ali to joe frazier i can go down the list of fighters who have had to come back from losses the thing is that i feel that the loss made me that much more determined to win i look back and ask myself why i lost and how i can improve upon it im just that much more hungrier
8350110 i have learned that i am a champion because i am willing to face a challenge above all things i believe in god and i believe in myself i feel as though i really dont have any limits to what i am capable of doing when i have been pushed to the limit i have been able to get through situations one way or another
8350111 what fighters go through is what you call an emotional rollercoaster we have to endure pain every single day whether its emotional mental or physical maybe from something simple as to not being able to touch your wife or girlfriend or not being able to eat the food that your mind wants to eat or even when you have days of being lonely and you cant go out and be with your friends sometimes you are sore but you have to get up and do the exact same thing that go you sore in the first place you learn a lot about yourself as a fighter and it just makes you a stronger and better person
8350112 boxing has been my life because it has allowed me to see the world and meet all kinds of interesting people it has also allowed me to take out my anger on a bag or even in the ring which is much better than taking it out on somebody on the street i have met all kinds of wonderful people from around the world and ive gotten to experience a lot of beautiful cities and countries that i never would have had the chance to see even if i had an associates degree in college in a lot of ways boxing has been my college and my doctrine and i guess its just been the school of hard knocks because it has really paid off for me my goal is to be the best i can at my craft and hope that i can inspire other people to stay away from the streets and things like guns and violence i try to do positive things through boxing and i hope people can see that boxing has just had many many advantages for me
8350113 that was a great victory because i have wanted to become the heavyweight champion of the world my whole life i talked to god time and time again throughout my career and for him to actually bless me with that victory was a dream come true i realized that i truly was the heavyweight champion of the world and god really was listening to me i had been praying to him for years and he showed that he really did listen to me to me that was the type of feeling like no other
8350114 for one god has helped me through times in this world where i am frustrated or angry and if it wasnt for the words of god i know that i probably would have done something stupid whether it would have been stealing something or hurting somebody even if i know i could have gotten away with it i know that god was watching so that always made me realize i would have to answer to him he really taught me how to be patient in life and he opened up a lot of doors for me god is everything to me and i pretty much try to live my life through him
8350115 i love children and i love speaking to kids i love trying to inspire children to let them know that they can do anything in life that they put their mind to if they can see it in their mind then they dont need anybody to tell them what they can and cant do i am the living true example of that i wasnt a big kid growing up but i always had faith in god and determination and thats always what made all the difference in my chances of getting to where ive been at i just want kids to know that you dont always need a mother and a father in life because if you have a relationship with god and believe in yourself then all things are possible
8350116 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

8350128 ik zou naar het kantoor van mijn baas gaan de penis op zijn bureau leggen en hem vragen om loonsverhoging
8350129 ik zou mijn ex vriend opzoeken met hem naar bed gaan vragen zich om te draaien om iets nieuws te proberen
8350130 ik zou dan een hele grote willen en deze aan iedereen laten zien
8350131 ik zou mezelf in het openbaar in mijn kruis grijpen
8350132 ik zou bij het plassen de bril van de wc niet omhoog doen
8350133 ik zou direct naar het ziekenhuis gaan en de penis laten verwijderen
8350134 aan mijn man en twee zoons laten zien dat heel eenvoudig is om in de wc in plaats van ernaast te plassen

8350146 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8350147 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8350148 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8350149 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8350150 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8350160 for a company to be successful the functional parts have to work well together
8350161 someone needs to figure out what makes sense for all of it to work and finance is often a place where the proverbial buck really does stop
8350162 when that happens maybe you have a wonderful product thats selling so well and making so much money that you dont need a cfo to be sophisticated in other areas
8350163 when it becomes critical is when a company is morphing into new areas
8350164 acquisitions or new products may demand that the company look and act differently usually sales and marketing starts acting differently first but in the best case scenario the it activities come first when that is the case the cfo or whoever is leading it is a visionary but if finance is saying no were spending too much money on this then the processes dont change and the company is out of control
8350165 the decision to purchase an fia is frequently rooted in the desire to put money into a guaranteed savings vehicle that is protected from loss

8350217 shortly after he attacked her initially with his right hand to her left cheeck
8350218 there were a number of blows to her face and head and also blows to the top of her head
8350219 she states the initial attack lasted about ten minutes and was accompanied by some threats
8350220 that then stopped for a short period of time and the defendant sat with clenched fists
8350221 he then began punching her again and she said at one point there was a punch to the left side of her head which sent her to the floor
8350222 he then attacked her again when she was on the floor and at that point she asked him if she could go to bed

8350227 thats a good question and i dont think that anybody knows the answer i think the real question on some of the delegates mind is whether or not the roll call will be more faux than fair
8350228 what i think theyre going to do and there may be some theater is that theyll have two states that are going to stand up and say we have 25 votes for obama and six and a half for hillary clinton and then the next one will say something and then someone will stand up and say we should all vote for obama and then there will be no protest or there will be a protest but human nature is such as to avoid conflict when possible i dont think there will be a protest

8350236 senator menendez is a valued member of our team who we will rely on to help us share senator obamas message of change we can believe in

8350238 my advocacy for hillary was just that advocacy for hillary it was for hillary and not against obama for the primary i am fully enlisted in obamas campaign to achieve the change we all want
8350239 menendez is one of the leading latinos in the country and in the democratic party and i would have thought the obama campaign would have really wanted to bring him in the fold

8350243 being shot down does not qualify you to be president
8350244 i have just spoken to a woman who answered your office phone and she refused to listen to my complaint about the roll call vote decision by the nj delegates she stated that the roll call vote had nothing to do with the state of nj and that anything that governor corzine did with respect to that vote was being done on his own personal time this woman was extremely rude nasty and proceeded to hang up on me after her ranting i have been a democrat since 1976 when i cast my first vote for jimmy carter i will not be voting for another democratic governor in this state again and i will not be voting for sen obama in november you and the nj democratic party have made it quite clear that my vote is meaningless it is also quite obvious that the democratic party not only doesnt speak for me they dont even want to hear me

8350255 he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him

8350316 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority these human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard every human beings right to life and physical integrity from the moment of conception until death

8350783 output per hour or productivity rose 2 5 percent per year during the 2000 to 2007 cycle compared to 2 percent in the 1990s when family incomes fared much better the economy expanded in the 2000s but that growth clearly failed to reach most households a dynamic that implicates growing income inequality the fact that these disappointing income poverty and earnings trends occurred in the context of strong productivity growth is a reminder that in todays economy productivity growth creates only the potential for higher living standards as long as most workers lack the bargaining power to claim their share of the growth they have helped to generate that potential will not be realized
8350784 the improvement in health care coverage in 2007 was due to more americans obtaining coverage through government health insurance programs principally medicare and medicaid
8350785 the 12 5 percent rate in 2007 compares to 11 3 percent in 2000 it is unprecedented that poverty is higher at this point in an economic growth cycle and the damage from the failure of the economys growth to lift more people out of poverty is huge if the 2007 poverty rate were just the same as in 2000 approximately six million fewer americans would have lived in poverty in 2007 all signs are that the poverty rate will be driven higher in 2008 by a slowing economy and skyrocketing costs for housing energy and food
8350786 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
8350787 the 2007 levels are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years
8350788 when the data become available for 2008 the picture will undoubtedly grow more grim

8350837 speak to the israelites and say to them if a mans wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him by sleeping with another man and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure then he is to take his wife to the priest
8350838 the priest shall bring her and have her stand before the lord
8350839 if no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you

8351003 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8351004 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8351005 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8351006 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8351007 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8351008 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8351012 they play in the toughest conference in the country and have a unique blend of academic and athletic tradition we try to pride ourselves on similar characteristics at the division ii level
8351013 getting the chance to play against a program like connecticuts is an unbelievable opportunity for our student athletes to test their talent against the nations best

8351021 i want to make sure i get to vote what is the purpose of this convention if its not to vote
8351022 we are excited about the schedule that we put together
8351023 this was an accident waiting to happen the road has to be improved were talking about loads of double decker buses travelling down roads only wide enough for one to pass at a time
8351024 i was forced to jump to safety and lie down on the bridge parapet in order to avoid being hit by the buss wing mirror
8351025 the biggest problem is getting alton towers to pay for it and the last estimate was 13million
8351026 we ran up to the bridge to see what had happened and saw that there were cars backed up in both directions which wasnt something new because of the time of day
8351027 but then i looked down at craft house and saw this coach on its side and people were walking around injured and in a daze
8351028 there was this one man who was still stuck in the wreck the man who died i got to him first because he was sticking out of the back of the bus and he was moaning when i saw him
8351029 i just thought to myself is he the only one or are there more people in the wreck
8351030 i tried to speak to him but he was just moaning in agony because he was crushed in the wreckage i did not want to move him
8351031 i dont think i could have moved him even if i had tried so i had to leave him to deal with the other people who had come out of the wreckage
8351032 we used anything we could find for dressings including curtains and coats from the coach as well as bags and cuddly toys that they had won at alton towers as cushions
8351033 the images of the man who passed away kept coming into my mind
8351034 he also told me about his brothers and sisters who live in latvia and about why he had come over
8351035 i also learnt that he was only here for the season and once the harvest is over he will be going back for the winter
8351036 he told me about how they had planned this great day out in one of the countrys best theme parks i developed this bond with somebody i had never met before
8351037 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8351038 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8351039 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8351040 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica
8351041 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8351042 my instinct is it will be a really wet night

8351057 nanosolar has plenty of company in the photo voltaic and concentrating solar power start up space
8351058 companies such as heliovolt solfocus and suniva have all taken part in investment rounds exceeding 50 million
8351059 we have a short list of the industrys most experienced most scalable and most bankable customers
8351060 we dont announce names at this point we have many billions under contract
8351061 obviously starting up any advanced factory like these has its load of start up kinks to be worked through its a lot of work
8351062 at this time we are focused on product and customers and want to be known for making money not raising money
8351063 this financing was literally just a side effect of the industry partnerships we have established to implement solar utility power
8351064 years and years of struggle for a few moments of grace
8351065 it looks authentic to some degree but we would never ask for some of the things that are in the letter we wouldnt ask for such things as your passport your bank account your mothers maiden name and so on we just dont operate in that way

8351067 si sia ristabilito un contatto con la pi grande compagnia mondiale che lair france
8351068 sembra che gli esuberi siano molto di pi di quanto si supponesse qualche mese fa quando il governo prodi decise di accettare laccordo con lair france e naturalmente la questione della difesa del personale va salvaguardata
8351069 si ripropone in modo estremamente pi negativo quella che era la situazione che si era giunti a contrattare in marzo con il governo prodi
8351070 una farsa perch si sarebbero potuti risparmiare al contribuente italiano milioni e milioni perch la situazione che viene proposta adesso la stessa che si era riusciti a patteggiare in marzo con la air france con la differenza che i costi sono aumentati terribilmente e gli esuberi di personale sono maggiori rispetto a quelli a cui si era arrivati a marzo

8351120 todays developments may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8351121 the secretary general regrets that ongoing efforts to find a common solution on the way forward on the crisis in georgia within the security council may be complicated
8351122 on august 12 president dmitry medvedev and president nicolas sarkozy announced the six principles which contained a direct reference to the starting of international discussions on the status of abkhazia and south ossetia then it was dropped
8351123 so they were the ones who immediately started walking away from this i think diplomatic opportunity
8351124 that has created a certain dynamic and weve been warning about that since the unilateral declaration of independence of kosovo came on the horizon
8351125 we have been warning that it is providing additional emphasis to all those who are working for their independence
8351126 i personally believe that abkhazia and south ossetia have many more reasons and much better legal ground for their independence than kosovo so they have a much stronger case
8351127 it has no impact on the internationally established borders of georgia and will not change in any way the international communitys stand on the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia obviously the russian federation has through this senseless act eliminated itself as a viable peacekeeper for this conflict
8351128 if these actions are now accepted by the international community it will mean that foreign forces and groups around the world can use violence and ethnic cleansing to achieve their aims and be rewarded with independence
8351129 that means that third parties can arm sustain and direct those groups in order to change the boundaries on the worlds map this is unacceptable to georgia
8351130 when we have an aggressor state as a permanent member of the security council it is very hard to envisage any meaningful outcome or action at the security council
8351131 in that regard i am going to have a meeting today august 26 with un secretary general ban ki moon i am in constant consultation with the other permanent members of the security council and these consultations will determine which way we are going to go
8351132 opening of international discussions on lasting security and stability arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia

8351137 use it or lose it is the first principle of sovereignty in the arctic
8351138 we would hope that an aggressive approach to our sovereignty would persuade countries to respect that sovereignty and to obviously deal with us before they send vessels in our water
8351139 sovereignty is something that you use it or you lose it
8351140 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

8351159 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8351160 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8351161 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8351162 and i wasnt gonna stand for it anymore ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged

8351166 im not going to be able to talk about that
8351167 ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged
8351168 she knows better than most the qualities and experiences and the kind of leadership that john mccain would provide are far different than that of president bush
8351169 the mccain campaign keeps emphasizing that mccain was a prisoner in vietnam as proof of his qualification for the presidency well so was gary glitter and im not voting for him either
8351170 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8351171 after clintons speech last night what if democrats dont have enough internecine warfare anymore isnt the thought of an easy democratic win a bit harrowing it will be so depressing and undramatic if obama wins in a landslide with a 60 seat democratic majority in the senate
8351172 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8351173 ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged

8351182 john key has done the right thing he has announced that he will not work with winston peters post election unless peters clears his name over the owen glenn fiasco helen clark has painted her prevarication as a duty to be fair but few are fooled by this high sounding bullshit
8351183 john key has done the right thing he has announced that he will not work with winston peters post election unless peters clears his name over the owen glenn fiasco
8351184 absolutely wont work with him not on my watch no chance unless hes innocent in which case i take it all back

8351195 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis

8351204 i will always see us as the underdog even when weve sold a million records
8351205 were still not a household name were still very much a cult band were certainly not aerosmith
8351206 but you said your vows and you closed the door on so many men who would have loved you more
8351207 so as soon as i got there i was like why am i here but for every record that we do i try to do something unique to that record in order to change the perspective on the songs im writing
8351208 even if i dont get anything particularly new out of it at least i get one or two songs that i wrote in that place that make the record unique for me
8351209 maybe theyre afraid to look too far ahead but its just a part of life
8351210 well dig a grave just about every other day we have 180 or so each year most of those here at calvary the biggest change were seeing is more cremations ive heard its up to like 20 percent now
8351211 i know that some of the folks i talk to are a little nervous about being in a cemetery
8351212 i know i was as squeamish as the next guy before i got used to the place

8351217 having worked with actors for many years i find it hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into showbusiness
8351218 but the next time that you see a chimpanzee in a movie on tv or in an ad chances are thats exactly what happened

8351223 the council set exactly the same level that they always set but due to the weather this year the sound stayed low
8351224 as a result the sound hit those decibel readings much much earlier than normal resulting in the sound being recorded at much louder volumes off site than normal so we were obligated by the council to turn our levels down
8351225 the sound levels on site are almost entirely dictated by the levels off site
8351226 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo

8351230 as for experience arguably the greatest president in all history abraham lincoln had two years experience when he ran for president

8351235 the idea of home is at the core of this record
8351236 the places weve called home leaving home being away and returning home and the importance of family and friends and the people we love my objective in the songwriting process is to be honest i want folks to feel like the tune was written for them and identify with what the song is about
8351237 there are many nuances in which we attempted to reflect human emotion through sound and arrangement for example the chorus of the places we lived contains chimes that are representative of an old time doorbell the chaotic middle section of time with you signifies the feeling of helplessness that i had when i wrote the tune welcome to the factory was made by using random non musical objects like a drill bit pounded on a brake drum or a mic stand scraping up against an empty reel of tape it creates a robot like sound bed that gives off the feeling of working on an assembly line one wrong turn is about an individual that made a bad decision and ended up behind bars i sang it through a six foot metal tube with the mic at the opposite end to create the feeling of isolation these are the kinds of things were thinking about in the studio always looking at the songs on multiple levels
8351238 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family

8351261 global climate change is the planets greatest threat and our response will determine the very future of life on this earth despite the efforts of our current administration to deny the science of climate change and the need to act we still believe that america can be earths best hope not its greatest impediment we will implement a market based cap and trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary to avoid catastrophic change and we will set interim targets along the way to ensure that we meet our goal we will invest in advanced energy technologies to build the clean energy economy and create millions of new good green collar american jobs because the environment is a truly global concern the u s must be a leader in combating climate change around the world including exporting climate friendly technologies to developing countries we will use innovative measures to dramatically improve the energy efficiency of buildings including establishing a grant program for early adopters and providing incentives for energy conservation we will encourage local initiatives sustainable communities personal responsibility and environmental stewardship and education nationwide
8351262 the same human economic activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
8351263 republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by the aficionados of centralized command and control government
8351264 research should be based on science not ideology we need to invest in biomedical research and stem cell research so that we are at the leading edge of prevention and treatment we will lift the current administrations ban on using federal funding for embryonic stem cells cells that would have otherwise have been discarded and lost forever for research that could save lives we will ensure that our patent laws protect legitimate rights while not stifling innovation and creativity we will end the bush administrations war on science restore scientific integrity and return to evidence based decision making
8351265 like our founders we believe that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires we believe that change comes not from the top down but from the bottom up and that few are closer to the people than our churches synagogues temples and mosques to face todays challenges from saving our planet to ending poverty we need all hands on deck faith based groups are not a replacement for government or secular non profit programs rather they are yet another sector working to meet challenges of the 21st century we will empower grassroots faith based and community groups to help meet challenges like poverty ex offender reentry and illiteracy at the same time we can ensure that these partnerships do not endanger first amendment protections and that public funds are not used to proselytize or discriminate we will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are only used on programs that actually work
8351266 we affirm every citizens right to apply religious values to public policy and the right of faith based organizations to participate fully in public programs without renouncing their beliefs removing religious objects or symbols or becoming subject to government imposed hiring practices
8351267 the united states has a direct national security interest in dramatically reducing global poverty and joining with our allies in sharing more of our riches to help those most in need
8351268 we will double our annual investment in meeting these challenges to 50 billion by 2012 and ensure that those new resources are directed toward worthwhile goals but if america is going to help others build more just and secure societies our trade deals debt relief and foreign aid must not come as blank checks we will couple our support with an insistent call for reform to combat the corruption that rots societies and governments from within as part of this new funding we will create a 2 billion global education fund that will bring the world together in eliminating the global education deficit with the goal of supporting a free quality basic education for every child in the world education increases incomes reduces poverty strengthens communities prevents the spread of disease improves child and maternal health and empowers women and girls
8351269 one in eight americans live in poverty today nearly 13 million of the poor are children we cant allow this kind of suffering and hopelessness to exist in our country its not who we are
8351270 working together we can cut poverty in half within ten years we will provide all our children a world class education from early childhood through college we will develop innovative transitional job programs that place unemployed people into temporary jobs and train them for permanent ones to help workers share in our countrys productivity well expand the earned income tax credit and raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation the majority of adults in poverty are women and to combat poverty we must work for fair pay support for mothers and policies that promote responsible fatherhood well start letting our unions do what they do best again organize and lift up our workers well make sure that every american has affordable health care that stays with you no matter what happens we will assist american indian communities since 10 of the 20 poorest counties in the u s are on indian lands well bring businesses back to our inner cities increase the supply of affordable housing and establish promise neighborhoods that provide comprehensive services in areas of concentrated poverty
8351271 no nation spends more in combined public and private efforts to combat disease and poverty around the world and no nation works harder to ensure the continued vitality of the global economy our reasons for doing so are both moral and practical for a world where half of the human race lives on a few dollars a day is neither just nor stable including the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development is part and parcel of the republican approach to world trade through open markets and fair competition it must also be a top priority of our foreign policy decades of massive aid have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries where it has often propped up failed policies and corrupt rulers we will target foreign assistance to high impact goals fostering the rule of law through democratic government emphasizing literacy and learning and concentrating on the foundations for economic development clean water agricultural improvement and microcredit funding for small enterprises
8351272 we must fight hiv aids in our country and around the world we support increased funding into research care and prevention of hiv aids and support providing medicaid coverage to more low income hiv positive americans
8351273 a massive human tragedy it is also a security risk of the highest order that threatens to plunge nations into chaos there are an estimated 33 million people across the planet infected with hiv aids including more than 1 million people in the u s we must do more to fight the global hiv aids pandemic as well as malaria tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases we will provide 50 billion over five years to strengthen existing u s programs and expand them to new regions of the world including southeast asia india and parts of europe where the hiv aids burden is growing we will increase u s contributions to the global fund to ensure that global efforts to fight endemic disease continue to move ahead

8351276 it is in the best interests of all parties including the united states that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict with a democratic viable palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the jewish state of israel to do so we must help israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace while isolating those who seek conflict and instability and standing with israel against those who seek its destruction the united states and its quartet partners should continue to isolate hamas until it renounces terrorism recognizes israels right to exist and abides by past agreements sustained american leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the president of the united states the creation of a palestinian state through final status negotiations together with an international compensation mechanism should resolve the issue of palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there rather than in israel all understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel the parties have agreed that jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations it should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths
8351277 the momentum of change in the middle east has been in the right direction
8351278 we reaffirm americas commitment to israels security and will ensure that israel maintains a qualitative edge in military technology over any potential adversaries we recognize israels need for secure defensible borders and its right to exist as a jewish state able to defend itself against homicide bombings and other attacks against its people we support the vision of two democratic states living in peace and security israel with jerusalem as its capital and palestine for that to become a reality the palestinian people must support leaders who reject terror embrace the ethos of democracy and respect the rule of law we call on arab governments throughout the region to help advance that goal the u s seeks a comprehensive and lasting peace in the middle east negotiated between the parties themselves without the imposition of an artificial timetable and without the demand that israel deal with entities which continue to pledge her destruction part of that negotiation process must be a just fair and realistic framework for dealing with the palestinian refugee issue
8351279 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the
8351280 because our childrens future is best preserved within the traditional understanding of marriage we call for a constitutional amendment that fully protects marriage as a union of a man and a woman so that judges cannot make other arrangements equivalent to it

8351286 we affirm every citizens right to apply religious values to public policy and the right of faith based organizations to participate fully in public programs without renouncing their beliefs removing religious objects or symbols or becoming subject to government imposed hiring practices
8351287 republican leadership has made religious liberty a central element of u s foreign policy asserting religious freedom should be a priority in all americas international dealings we salute the work of the u s commission on international religious freedom and urge special training in religious liberty issues for all u s diplomatic personnel

8351315 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8351316 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8351317 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8351318 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8351319 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8351320 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing

8351373 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8351374 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting

8351506 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8351507 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8351508 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case

8351538 but its all a capitalist equivalence between two elements of society that want to matter but dont
8351539 because of their deep commitment to christianity black americans have never been close to the generally atheistic and anti capitalist movements of the far left

8351608 they didnt get on like a house on fire but morgan felt at the time there was common ground between them but it has evaporated since that only one on one meeting and both are now polarised as ever
8351609 mugabe said the violence came from the mdc but morgan challenged him
8351610 eventually mugabe agreed that they should meet again where morgan could present him with the evidence it was meant to happen the following thursday but it never happened mugabe became unavailable now the old suspicion and antagonism have come back
8351611 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster

8351655 reflect a significant body of science showing that bpa may play a larger role than previously thought in a host of common health problems including prostate cancer breast cancer and early puberty
8351656 more research is needed to better understand bpas implications for human health
8351657 however because these effects in animals occur at bisphenol a exposure levels similar to those experienced by humans the possibility that bisphenol a may alter human development cannot be dismissed
8351658 the bottom line is there really is a convergence of opinion that is occurring

8351663 political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and give an appearance of solidarity to pure wind
8351664 if you tell people a big enough lie often enough they will believe it
8351665 more and more people are catching on to mainstream media lies
8351666 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8351667 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8351668 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8351669 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8351670 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8351671 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8351672 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8351673 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8351674 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8351675 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8351676 we e intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8351677 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients
8351678 are you ready for victory then you must be ready for unity that is the only way we are going to win and have this victory

8351684 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8351685 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8351686 not having read their chart and not knowing much about their case
8351687 probably because you were feeling the wrong side of the knee
8351688 well it didnt hurt your leg it was just sore before
8351689 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8351690 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8351691 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8351692 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction
8351693 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
8351694 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8351695 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8351696 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8351697 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions
8351698 i dont see any evidence of remorse or concern for anyone but himself
8351699 i do feel deep remorse and would like to apologize to any customer who ever had a bad experience with my company
8351700 i apologize to all the great people the employees of berkeley theyve given their heart and soul i let them down
8351701 it probably will take some years before that is accomplished
8351702 the time i have left id like to spend with them i dont think its fair to take me away from them
8351703 i think the company did a very effective job of glossing over these questions about safety and effectiveness in its marketing campaign and convincing the public that this vaccine would indeed prevent cervical cancer as sharyn right points out that simply hasnt not been proven long term
8351704 top medical breakthrough of 2006 has to be the cancer vaccine for cervical cancer gardasil
8351705 experts are recommending that girls start getting the vaccine routinely at age 11 or 12
8351706 the lightning fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must have injection in the united states and europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing
8351707 its not controversial except we dont want our 11 year old kids to have sex but at some point our kids are going to be sexually active
8351708 if you can invest that in your childs life over the next 20 or 30 years thats the best investment you can make
8351709 protects against four hpv types 16 18 6 and 11 types 16 and 18 together account for about 70 percent of all cervical cancers
8351710 that will potentially benefit the health of millions of women by providing protection against the types of hpv that cause the majority of cervical cancer
8351711 these reports of conditions that have occurred following vaccination they do not uh necessarily mean they are causally related
8351712 by employing an executive order perry sidestepped opposition in the legislature from conservatives and parents rights groups who fear such a requirement would condone premarital sex and interfere with the way texans raise their children
8351713 i ts so hard to even write a permission slip for school trip if you ask moms to sign up or dads to sign up for this the chance is we wont immunize as many children
8351714 keeping children out of school because they have not been vaccinated with the hpv vaccine is a serious precedent setting action it replaces parental medical decision making with government regulation which should be reserved for the improvement of the general public health
8351715 it would not be possible for the high court to act on surmises and conjectures and disturb the findings recorded by the trial court

8351726 not see it as a sacrifice but as a celebration
8351727 shed prayed about it overnight and shed decided that she didnt need all of it for herself
8351728 shed never been able to give large gifts and now she could
8351729 i have the things i need and god always provides
8351730 it goes to minnesota it goes to california it goes to about 65 people here in vancouver
8351731 i go out and meet people on the street or in the stores i hear them talking about client troubles with medicare medicaid social security or my doctor or the c van buses
8351732 i let them have my number and they call me or e mail me and let them know if theres something if they dont know how to handle then i get on my phone or my computer and go to work
8351733 ive had people call me a jesus freak or a jesus fanatic and i laugh and i say thank you
8351734 getting close to god is the cake and the blessings and even the pain are the icing on the cake because we learn through pain

8351740 the feeling i get from many leafs fans is that they
8351741 the maple leafs are perennially and justifiably measured against the franchises last stanley cup winner in 1967 and there are precious can mark bell regain his form
8351742 ive always wanted to own my own business as well as be involved with the game of golf my wife said we should go for it ive been with two different companies in the aviation business for my entire career and i felt that the time was right for a career change through my experience with both companies i feel the unique opportunity total golf adventures presents is a perfect fit you know the saying that timing is everything thats what we are betting on as i build the tga franchise here
8351743 my wife and i did plenty of research about the golf industry and youth golf in particular by far and away the golf enrichment program that tga offers provides the programs and opportunities for kids to learn and grow that we were looking for tga already has an extremely successful franchise in the dallas ft worth area and it was easy to see the expansion possibilities in collin county right next door
8351744 when we interview prospective new territory directors two of the qualities we look for are the innate passion for the game and a strong business background
8351745 we are convinced that steves background and experience will allow him to share his passion with youngsters and to grow the game of golf with a tga program bordering collin county in west dfw steves community presence will be that much greater

8351749 3g services will provide higher bandwidth on mobile that will enable mvas provider companies to sell the data that is in the form of video currently video clips having the duration of hardly five seconds can be downloaded against this 3g will allow 10 to 15 minutes of video shoots internet access will be much faster and it will give an edge to mvas providers
8351750 the indian consumer s capacity to adopt new technology is faster than many other nationals it will lead towards offerings of many more value added services like financial transactions different advertisements depending upon demography entertainment downloads and much more
8351751 with the advent of 3g services like video conferencing and video streaming are expected to refresh the present mvas space given the gradual slump in basic prices 3g services will have a significant role to play in terms of creating a differentiation for operators with options like mobile number portability giving options to the subscribers to decide on operators without changing the number mvas is bound to play a major part in customer retention
8351752 i think weve got to do this and another million dollars
8351753 it would cost us more in the long run no doubt about it
8351754 i think our taxpayers will be very grateful for what weve been able to do
8351755 i am grateful to valencia for this gesture and for all that the club has given me and to vicente soriano for the effort he has made
8351756 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8351757 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me we just do the best we can stay under the radar i guess and see what we can do
8351758 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8351759 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8351760 the reason he hasnt won is just because we havent had our cars fast enough but hes been close
8351761 he should have won two or three times this year maybe he can be a contender for a championship and have the best part of his year after the chase starts
8351762 it was a long green run day and i ran third the rest of the day
8351763 but a lap down third and every time the caution would come out the leaders were passing lapped cars again and i never got the lucky dog
8351764 i finished 20th and we ended up losing the championship by 35 points all we needed was a top 10 there and i had the championship won
8351765 thats kind of sore i guess but hopefully it wont happen this year if we get in
8351766 youve got to put yourself in that position to be able to win a race
8351767 youre not going to win from running 20th youre going to be in position running in the top five
8351768 this is believed to be the first reported case of a space station computer getting a virus but a nasa spokesman said there had been previous instances

8351773 everyone that we play for some reason always has a countdown clock to when theyll play the university of miami
8351774 everyone its part of being at miami you have a target on you but you know what these guys understand on this football team that we went through a lot last year we understand what losing is and we understand not to take opponents lightly
8351775 were very grateful to coach shannon and the university of miami for giving us this opportunity
8351776 since the moment i arrived on this campus weve talked about miamis football program and what theyve done in the last 25 years with five national championships and how we hope to emulate that on the fcs level being another small private institution that wants to be nationally recognized
8351777 and thursday were going to see what hes going to do
8351778 if we didnt have all these freshmen on this football team wed probably have a one deep
8351779 its going to be the biggest crowd charleston southern athletics has ever played in front of
8351780 its a huge opportunity and were all looking forward to it
8351781 i made it very clear to sen mccain when i spoke to him yesterday and i made it very clear to his people that i am honored to be asked to speak at the convention and that i would be honored to do anything to help him win the presidency but that the state of california and the budget is the most important thing
8351782 so that if i dont have a budget i cannot speak at the convention
8351783 observe a level of decency and decorum demanded by the import of the moment of the presence of the one
8351784 its an interesting choice certainly not the type of town hall meeting john mccain has participated in across the country i wouldnt see that fitting with our campaign but then again our candidate doesnt enjoy the spotlight of fame quite like obama
8351785 i know that senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs on the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona from the mccain estate
8351786 but the problem is that that visual has been a little bit of a negative for him over the last few months
8351787 its hard because of those very clever ads by john mccain which turned the likability factor which normally elects a president back on senator obama
8351788 he wants to be someone who can lead the country and can relate to people
8351789 if it did have any doubts those greek columns wouldve been down
8351790 it marks the obama campaign and the democratic partys belief that this does need to be a process thats opened up to people again that people from every walk of life from every part of this country need to be invited to participate in their political process again that we need to open the doors up and give them the opportunity to come in and be part of the change
8351791 and i think that it will be a striking contrast between the final night of our convention and john mccains closing night which will be in front of the same people who probably do believe weve had great economic progress over the past eight years
8351792 researchers familiar with oceanic prehistory should work from a null hypothesis that human skeletal material found in palau represent modern humans of normal stature and body mass unfortunately it appears that berger et al did not do this and instead operated from a null hypothesis based off their initial impression from a few fragments that exhibited small or primitive dimensions one of which apparent brow ridges turned out to be carbonate precipitate that eventually flaked off that their sample represented a population of small bodied humans

8351800 when we think of deer we usually think of whitetails but anything with antlers is a member of the deer family they include caribou elk mule deer and moose
8351801 the book follows a variety of deer species through a typical year
8351802 it gives naturalists photographers and hunters an idea where they can find animals at any given time for instance if they want to see elk calves they can go up to wyoming in the first two weeks of june or if they want to see moose rutting they can go up to alaska in september
8351803 about a dozen photos of whitetails and some of the other animals in the book were shot at riverwood park which is right in the middle of mississauga surrounded by highways and homes
8351804 thats because people view them as maybe a sort of cow and are unafraid of them
8351805 my job is to make sure im not eaten i really make an effort to avoid that
8351806 for instance some will no doubt perceive the wolf as a villain but wolves are wolves just as deer are deer they are part of a healthy ecosystem neither species is good or bad
8351807 we had a picnic last night i wore jammies and the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice

8351819 you know all of the great defensive backs i have had at dorsey
8351820 antonio is just like them he has nfl written all over him
8351821 antonio reminds me a lot of ucla freshman rahim moore but maybe hes thicker
8351822 with a good senior season he will be one of the highest recruited safeties in the state
8351823 the reason why schools are taking a wait and see attitude is because he only played four games due to personal reasons
8351824 now that hes back hes ready for a big season
8351825 he hasnt missed a practice since he came back in spring
8351826 the thing that separates antonio from the rest is his physicality
8351827 but thats not is only is only talent antonio also has great ball skills and has the knack for making the big play
8351828 in fact all the gifts of nature that come to children including stress reduction longer attention span better physical and mental health also come to the good adult who introduces a child to nature

8351839 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance this will be counter productive for the country s economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8351840 the indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the country s competitiveness as well as support job creation
8351841 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore and because we have made this investment we will not move they are wrong
8351842 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think it s going to be a great cost to west bengal

8351859 i dont really care where i go right now but i kind of want to go with a friend
8351860 carmel teammate joe rippe is kind of in the same position and were thinking about going to school together if it works out he has an offer from air force and hes looking at a couple mac schools his favorite is miami ohio i never really looked into them until he said something so now they are on my list and contacting me

8351870 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8351871 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8351872 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8351873 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8351874 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8351894 the tel aviv court on tuesday has rejected taro s contention that sun pharma should have conducted a special tender offer under israeli law
8351895 the court stated that the directors should have studied the agreements prior to them being signed and should have confirmed then that they were in the company s best interest
8351896 the court stated that the directors cannot claim now that they suddenly decided a special tender offer is necessary
8351897 it is clear based on tuesday s ruling that the lawsuit by taro s independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement
8351898 these shareholders benefited from sun s investment which basically saved taro from collapse
8351899 obviously i would love to win a rally as soon as possible but you never know when its going to happen it could come quite unexpectedly

8351921 a life if counted by days is a series broken into multiples of still frames and creating space to discourage people with innocent intentions is cruel harmful mean and ugly and opposite everything the act of art represents to me it is a way to pray for those of us either too far away or too close to out hearts

8351925 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8351926 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8351927 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8351928 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8351929 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8351930 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8351931 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8351932 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8351933 he does not wish to discuss the legal implications in an ongoing case much of what he feels today is what he felt when he made his victim impact statement in 2004 the only difference is that he now knows his hockey career is over and he must daily deal with the anguish of the senseless attack that ended his nhl career
8351934 the enormous amount of stress and emotional turbulence this situation has introduced into my life and that of my family has taken its toll on all of us as i reflect on the impact this attack has had on me both on my health and on my life as a whole i am overwhelmed

8351937 i was out in the garden talking to a neighbour when there was a lot of commotion from the back of the outbuildings
8351938 we both looked over the fence and saw the polish tenants who lived at the briars inside and they said come and see this
8351939 we got some torches and found the big metal cage inside the building and there were 9mm rounds on the ground gun barrels on the floor and various other paraphernalia
8351940 i used to belong to gun clubs in my time in the raf and i have seen some of this equipment before and my mind twigged it was a gun factory
8351941 you get people stopping in the street asking is that the gun factory and thats a year later
8351942 three miles cross is very very quiet you wouldnt expect it here you wouldnt expect it anywhere
8351943 the buildings are away from the road and not surrounded by houses so there could have been banging welding cutting all those sort of things and people wouldnt have heard
8351944 i know the person who used to live there and he is as gobsmacked as anyone else
8351945 the data in this report refer to last year when everything was different
8351946 this year were losing jobs on a monthly basis inflation is running well over 5 percent and unemployment was last seen at 5 7 percent and rising
8351947 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8351948 the fall in private insurance was similar to recent years
8351949 that fall was offset by the rise in government insurance
8351950 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8351951 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8351952 with more current data we would see that the type of the poverty that we see among latinos has actually already spread to the general population
8351953 working households helped bake a bigger economic pie but ended up with thinner slices

8351966 you confuse intensity with desire and need with love as a consequence of this your relationships with others especially romantic partners can be powerful and spicy without engendering much closeness it takes time for you to recognize the habits that get in the way of intimacy it takes time to alter them once recognized letting go of negative history lays the groundwork for change give others permission to be different than everyone else has been before through this you give yourself permission to be different
8351967 you are very incisive and aggressive with your opinions you have a tendency towards fanaticism and often want to impose your ideas on others sometimes in a subtle manner and sometimes more imperatively

8352021 nintendo had a substantial supply nationwide for launch though some stores saw spot shortages due to unprecedented demand for this unique product we are providing retailers with a constant supply of wii fit so you should see a regular supply of wii fit on store shelves as we move through summer and into the holidays
8352022 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8352023 i had some strong disagreements with george bush and john mccain about the war in iraq but i thought the one thing we all agreed to was when our troops come home that they would be treated with the honor and respect that they deserve
8352024 the fact is those hundreds of thousands of troops returning home are not getting what they need its heartbreaking
8352025 in case of nuclear war those places that are downwind of major population centers and major military installations are most at risk from nuclear fallout the safest areas are on the pacific coast and away from population centers because only the pacific ocean is upwind however a nuclear war might include invasion of the united states in that case the rocky mountain areas might be safest regarding nuclear terrorism however the risk is a little different coastal cities especially high profile ones like new york washington and los angeles are most at risk
8352026 each american family should have as much emergency protection as its motivation and resources permit a national shelter system with full chemical biological and nuclear protection of 200 psi permiting survival of ground burst nuclear weapons within a mile could be built during a national program for about 500 per person instead our government will doubtless just continue to raise the level of risk by spending this money instead on foreign adventures some families have provided this level of protection for themselves the cost on a one family basis is much higher since few families do this i advocate the minishelter idea the shelters you now offer it gives good nuclear protection at a price and inconvenience many more families will pay it does not provide chemical not much of a risk and biological a high terrorist risk protection families that do not install shelters should at the very least educate themselves about expedient measures by reading nuclear war survival skills and obtaining a good radiation meter

8352041 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8352042 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8352043 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8352044 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8352061 well what if hes physically abusive to her and his children
8352062 but if when you do good and suffer for it you endure this is a gracious thing in the sight of god because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps
8352063 everyday that you are married to a spouse who has not quit trying to be better is a day to be very thankful for a willing heart to grow in an imperfect person is a miracle

8352066 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8352067 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8352068 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
8352069 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
8352070 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
8352071 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces pancreatitis
8352072 you could be causing more trouble than what you started with
8352073 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
8352074 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues
8352075 the probability of a delay to the regulatory approval of byetta once weekly is increased by the fdas review of the current byetta label and approval of the drug in 2010 may now be unrealistic
8352076 the risk for which the fda wants to see more data for byetta lar is fairly high in my view
8352077 i have seen more patients that are not on byetta that have pancreatitis than i have on byetta i have never seen a case of pancreatitis on byetta
8352078 het was een initiatief van de amateursectie omdat ik zo veel mogelijk goede mensen voor de knvb wil behouden stond ik achter een dergelijke constructie en een volgens mij ook zeker werkbare situatie maar in een persoonlijk onderhoud met van praag vond hij de constructie niet werkbaar en wees het voorstel af

8352086 it is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980s potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought prone regions in north america and central asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones erosion of the west antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level and opening of the fabled northwest passage
8352087 if you make enough predictions one is bound to come true
8352088 the major difficulty in accepting this theory has been the absence of observed warming coincident with the historic co2 increase
8352089 the time history of the warming obviously does not follow the course of the co2 increase fig 1 indicating that other factors must affect global mean temperature
8352090 the hot dry summer of 1980 may be typical of the united states in the next century if the model results are correct
8352091 the recent series of reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc did not include such bold predictions for the possible loss of antarctic ice the ipccs estimate was that antarctic ice flow would continue at the same rate it did from 1993 to 2003
8352092 is ice free for the first time since satellite records began in 1978
8352093 het waterleven is voor een kind fantastisch je ziet kinderen altijd langs sloten lopen salamanders vangen kikkers kikkervisjes dat is een enorme leerschool
8352094 ik wil zoveel mogelijk amsterdammers het liefst al van jongs af aan in contact te brengen met groen en natuur er wordt in amsterdam dan ook hard gewerkt om nieuwe parkjes aan te leggen en het groen meer toegankelijk te maken de jan wolkerstuin komt in een buurt met veel kinderen die de natuur nu op een speelse en spannende manier kunnen ontdekken in deze nieuwe tuin met heuvels riet stromend water en gevarieerde beplanting
8352095 de marechaussee had de leiding en besloot wat de beste manier was om te handelen
8352096 zon verhaal kun je nog wel twee uur volhouden maar dit duurde te lang mensen zien dat er niets aan de kist gebeurt
8352097 wij hebben zo goed mogelijk uitgelegd wat hen was overkomen en dat transavia er niet zo veel aan kan doen helaas waren de woordvoering van de marechaussee en het om voor ons volledig onbereikbaar
8352098 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8352099 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8352100 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8352101 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8352102 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8352103 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8352104 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8352105 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8352106 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8352107 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using fossil fuels
8352108 whenever people have had oil they have been really really willing to give it its a waste product for them so we are taking away their rubbish
8352109 with petrol prices so high lots of people are looking for ways to reduce their fuel bills and this is a fantastic way to do it
8352110 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the uk and the aggressive and unprecedented intervention in the apparently functioning adjudicatory processes of a longtime ally of the uk in contravention of well established principles of international comity

8352115 all of us here at the new york anime festival are honored to have chef morimoto join us this year
8352116 masaharu morimoto has done more to expose america to japanese cooking than perhaps any other chef in the last decade and we are eager to give him a platform in americas biggest city to celebrate his accomplishments and open a few more hearts minds and bellies to japanese cuisine
8352117 do the search engines currently look for these microformats in their ranking algorithms
8352118 i really like the concept of microformats and your explanation is very informative the vcard example to make this example more semantic wouldnt it be beneficial to use an somewhere in there that is what the tag is for right
8352119 say you want to sell your car what if we could somehow post a listing to our blog and then easily let services which cared about classifieds listings know that there is a new or updated classified at my site the missing piece that would enable this is a standard format after all html doesnt have a element

8352123 this acquisition is another sign that cisco and microsoft are on a path to fighting head to head
8352124 this marks another market in which cisco and microsoft will compete voip including unified communications and desktop video collaboration meeting webex tools set top box software and now email servers
8352125 our experience tells us that when two technology giants collide the winner is the end buyer pricing generally goes down while innovation accelerates both bad for margins
8352126 we dont believe microsoft is scared of a tough fight neither is cisco
8352127 microsoft and cisco battling will most likely not be a winning situation for shareholders as it could be bloody
8352128 we have always held that email is a critical part of a unified communications solution and we have a 15 year head start in delivering email
8352129 we think this acquisition represents a validation of the way we have defined and viewed this market
8352130 complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future

8352146 there were tons of them in the south decades before the 60s just read menckens dispatches from the scopes trial for the sickening details
8352147 but they really were hillbillies and on the fringes of society further what they were back in the day is not what we would call evangelicals of today they were not a political movement they didnt have multi million dollar stadium churches and were anything but middle or upper class evangelicals today are middle and upper class go to any beedroom community in the south or midwest and you will see what i am talking about
8352148 far to many people today dont do what they want because they are far to concerned on being socially accepted
8352149 the article in christianity today argues that this is a function of the social support provided by an inclusive community but i wonder if it isnt in part the decision to stand out from the community that leads to greater self reported happiness
8352150 they are not hillbillies honestly there are few real hillbillies left anymore they are the middle class and children of the middle class kids who grew up in the 1960s
8352151 frum talks about this stuff in his book on the 70s the 70s saw the fading of the old buttoned up name brand mainline churches and the sudden mainstreaming of a warmly emotional and expressive protestantism something similar happened on the catholic side with the emergence of the charismatic movement

8352162 inflation is going to abate somewhat because of the falloff in energy and grain prices
8352163 thats going to help keep inflation in check and really will mitigate the need for further rate increases
8352164 we dont think theyre bank of canada going to raise rates anytime soon
8352165 the cyclical upswing in commodity prices from the low in october 2001 at 226 8 per cent is now virtually on par with the huge 235 1 per cent advance in the 1970s in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo
8352166 the strength of this upswing is a testimony to the remarkable growth of emerging market demand this decade in the face of significant supply constraints in many resource sectors
8352167 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8352168 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases

8352175 hurricane gustav weakened as it moved across haiti today and headed for open water where it may pick up strength and threaten oil rigs and refineries in the gulf of mexico crude oil fell after rising earlier
8352176 i think the view is that it seems less likely cibc is going to have to issue equity
8352177 where i disagree is the notion that the subprime charges are declining
8352178 the reason theyre not taking subprime charges this quarter is because credit spreads declined as in these monolines are a little bit better
8352179 our business model is based on providing affordable medical care to the underserved middle income group in india
8352180 after nearly a decade of experience in asia we know that sophisticated hospitals built in neighborhoods rather than the central city are the best way to serve patients
8352181 there is no evidence of any unauthorised access to any other customer data
8352182 we are one of the largest outpatient pain centers in ohio but we are not concerned with being the largest only the best our growth has been selective and we choose to associate with the best of the best in order to give our patients top quality pain care dr thomas reflects that quality and will only improve on what we already offer
8352183 additionally we are dedicated to providing a comprehensive multidisciplinary environment which clearly offers the best option for a patients chronic pain condition

8352193 at the same time ill be saddened to leave the friends ive made and colleagues ive worked with here in clatsop county its been a privilege and an honor to work with so many talented and dedicated people
8352194 scott has provided steady leadership for the county and the board of commissioners weve been able to accomplish a long list of our goals thanks to his efforts
8352195 with limits on property taxes and fluctuations in revenue from the clatsop state forest it was vital that the county put in place a strategy to make sure it can maintain stable funding for all its services
8352196 the storm and the aftermath really showed how dedicated our staff is
8352197 county employees from virtually every department stepped up did their best to help our citizens recover from the that event even workers whose own homes were damaged in the storm

8352202 we believe we are strongly placed to deliver this much needed infrastructure
8352203 we estimate that to build a significant fibre optic network covering the auckland region would cost more than 1 billion
8352204 this is clearly a significant investment and one that could take shape in a number of different ways depending on the nature and structure of broadband investment funds proposed this option will remain a key area of focus for us
8352205 we understand those assets and we are assessing our options in that space
8352206 i think its also important to note that we have a share buyback in place and that provides a valuable investment option for us

8352222 he tried to prove the point that it was a period of crisis for the state and it was unintentional if coalition norms were not adhered to
8352223 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two

8352323 if the fighting will continue for every civilian killed we will execute 10 moro rebels
8352324 the civilians are suffering now thats why we are asking the leadership of the milf to stop its harassment and attacks in mindanao because it will only complicate the life of the people
8352325 came from their elders during the time of commander toothpick
8352326 our instruction to them is not to go to battle if they have done something wrong against other people to follow gods commandments to avoid accidents that may lead to their deaths
8352327 the government must be held responsible for any act of this gang
8352328 we hold the philippine government responsible for whatever savagery barbarism destruction committed by this gangster group against the bangsamoro people
8352329 the creation of the ilaga group is not necessary we have the military
8352330 mindanao is not only for the muslims but for christians and lumad as well because we are the ones that form the tri people group the owner of mindanao
8352331 we need to unite muslims christians and lumad and my message to the muslim admire what the milf group is doing because it will only destroy the development in the region
8352332 we must shun the leadership of the milf they are the ones that destroy our life look at what is happening around you many civilians have been affected
8352333 we are for arming civilians in areas targeted by milf for them to defend their families and properties
8352334 i am asking those who will join in the future to strictly follow our constitution
8352335 we will let authorities hunt them with the bounty for their arrest their followers will hand them to authorities
8352336 we gave a one week warning against kato and bravo before to stop launching attacks we are happy that they listen to us but if they launch attacks again we will fight
8352337 after the fighting broke out they approached us and asked if we can help
8352338 our warfare style is not offensive but defensive i think the situation will not get worse but if the milf will launch other attacks we are ready to fight
8352339 what an opportunity to see what was going on in the industry

8352347 la respuesta es un grosero error de pol tica exterior los jefes de estado no le contestan a los analistas econ micos de otros estados si necesita contestar que lo haga con cifras y no con agresiones y menos a espa a podr a haber dicho que quienes elaboraron el informe sobre el nivel de riesgo de la econom a argentina son malos analistas y punto
8352348 estamos ante otra muestra de la pol tica de asilamiento total del kirchnerismo
8352349 la argentina ten a buena relaci n con venezuela brasil y espa a ahora estamos perdiendo en la relaci n con espa a y los brasile os claramente toman distancia s lo queda la pol tica exterior autista con venezuela
8352350 a pronosticar m s sobre las cosas de ellos que las de los dem s
8352351 la presidenta deber a saber que el banco de espa a no depende del estado espa ol es una irresponsabilidad vincular al estado con las advertencias de un grupo de analistas bancarios de ninguna manera corresponde que sea ella quien conteste si quer a explicaciones debi pedirlas a trav s de la canciller a no puede plantear la discusi n como un tema de estado a estado
8352352 tiene que ver con una caracter stica del matrimonio kirchner
8352353 m s que quejarse por lo que dice el banco central de otro pa s cristina kirchner deber a dar explicaciones de por qu un pa s que seg n afirma el gobierno goza de una salud financiera ptima paga intereses del 15 por ciento por la colocaci n de su deuda o la salud financiera que describen no existe o detr s de todo esto hay un negociado enorme
8352354 cada vez que cualquier agencia de un gobierno realiza alguna acci n se reacciona en contra del estado no se entiende que en espa a el banco central es una entidad aut rquica y que el gobierno espa ol no interfiere en sus decisiones como si pasa en la argentina
8352355 una vez m s el gobierno demuestra que se pelea hasta con sus aliados
8352356 la idea presidencial de que el informe tiene poco que ver con un an lisis de la econom a argentina
8352357 ser a deseable que no s lo tuvi ramos actitudes declamativo sino adem s que se implementen acciones concretas me preocupa la posibilidad de que la discusi n quede en el terreno de los medios mientras que los espa oles siguen actuando seg n sus intereses y en contra de los nuestros
8352358 el estado tendr a que iniciar acciones judiciales contra el controlante de la l nea a rea marsans para que no terminemos haci ndonos cargo de una deuda que no nos corresponde
8352359 no creo que la relaci n con espa a se vaya a resentir el v nculo est impregnado de intereses muy fuertes espa a es el principal inversor en la argentina y creo que eso es lo que va a primar
8352360 hay que analizar en profundidad la situaci n econ mica que plantea el informe
8352361 aunque el pa s no afronta problemas macroecon micos importantes hay que prestar atenci n a la advertencia

8352366 no offense to the folks who will be racing out in california this weekend but theres no place id rather be than darlington and no weekend id rather be there than labor day
8352367 were bringing down the car he won with at darlington in 1972 and 73 weve had a devil of a time finding tires to put on it the ones that are on there are 30 something years old now were going to need to tell him to take it easy before he goes out there but telling david pearson to slow down has always been kind of a waste of breath
8352368 they havent forgotten where they came from down there you cant really say that about the rest of the sport you know
8352369 right after i took the job i talked to junior johnson about the idea of a historic festival

8352371 once we were able to start making calls and asking who might be interested in participating we knew we were on to something
8352372 real cars instead of those winged deal theyre out there running today
8352373 but some of the earliest races run at darlington were indy car races harold brasington who built the track at darlington was inspired to do so after he attended the indianapolis 500 so he ran open wheel races there because that had always been his dream

8352375 we do believe gustav is going to emerge into the gulf as a major hurricane category 3 or better
8352376 it has a chance for a brief period to be a category 5
8352377 whether or not it can produce the same amount of damage as katrina or rita remains to be seen
8352378 i expect somewhere near 85 percent of the gulf energy infrastructure will be shut in along with a significant increase in damage potential
8352379 starting today were taking out nonessentials for most of the major oil companies
8352380 more and more of the tracks are all in agreement somewhere between houston and new orleans were going to have a problem thats the heart of the platforms and theyre still saying category 3 or higher
8352381 depending on the way it takes tomorrow they are going to make a decision whether to evacuate the platforms either friday or saturday
8352382 lidea pi assurda e ridicola come se io potessi mai trovare il modo di esistere senza aver bisogno di te
8352383 we need to get past the era of extreme dieting
8352384 health management needs to be a bigger part of weight management
8352385 we shouldnt name and shame mum feels guilty about the whole thing and feels bad about it
8352386 it doesnt take away the risk entirely weight still matters
8352387 it is reassuring to see that physical activity really does make an impact
8352388 if youre overweight or obese you cant really get back to that lower risk entirely with just physical activity alone
8352389 who here will commit to eating 2 more raw fresh fruits or vegetables just 2 additional servings than you already do and i swear to you only 7 hand raised 7 out of 300 women there to learn about getting healthier felt they could commit to eating 2 servings more a day

8352393 i devoured this book and loved every single page this is a thick juicy read and one i would pick up again in a heartbeat
8352394 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8352395 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8352396 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first
8352397 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8352398 im going to make sure im here personally to lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts necessary after the fact
8352399 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8352400 anyone who dials 911 has a reasonable expectation that he or she will be connected to an emergency operator
8352401 this expectation exists whether that person is dialing 911 from a traditional wireline phone a wireless phone or a voip phone
8352402 moreover we need to ensure that our enhanced 911 rules provide meaningful automatic location information that permits first responders to reliably find callers even when they are using mobile wireless or voip phones
8352403 in 2007 two very precious members of our family were murdered my sister in law aysun sesen and her desired unborn daughter gul were stripped away from us forever
8352404 pregnancy is already considered an aggravating factor we ask the canadian government to recognize that we are coping with two losses two deaths
8352405 we were pleased that bill c 484 introduced by conservative mp ken epp acknowledged the fact that we have to cope with two losses
8352406 although we have not seen the text of the law we do not believe that what justice minister nicholson is proposing demonstrates any compassion for the ordeal our family has had to endure since we lost both aysun and gul we know in our hearts that most canadians understand the painful reality we have been going through over the past few months and we are deeply disappointed that the canadian government is not showing aysun and gul the respect they both deserved
8352407 we understand mr epps disappointment and are thankful for all the effort he has put forth in order to make a real difference in the lives of families who like ours were stripped of the right to share everyday life with a daughter sister or friend and with a grand daughter or grand son niece or nephew

8352425 secretly theyre full of fireworks and dynamite at the stroke of midnight they light them all on fire in a huge loud pyromania display
8352426 we would try to have odd combinations of logos such as gluttony and grandma approved on the same thing
8352427 the icons gave the book a lot of life and people really reacted to the categories which are kind of a snapshot into daves brain

8352455 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8352456 no other state would have jurisdiction under the first three prongs and it is in the best interests of the child
8352457 it did not need another lawyer to weigh in on the purely legal issue of jurisdiction
8352458 was not unreasonable much less arbitrary capricious or beyond the letter or reason of the law
8352459 1 a court shall only exercise its jurisdiction to make an order for custody or access to a child where a the child is habitually resident in ontario at the commencement of the application
8352460 2 a child is habitually resident in the place where he or she resided a with both parents or b where the parents are living separate and apart with one parent under a separation agreement or with the consent implied consent or acquiescence of the other or under a court order
8352461 3 the removal or withholding of a child without the consent of the person having custody of the child does not alter the habitual residence of the child
8352462 it does not lie in the mothers mouth now to assert a re established connection as a result of her unilateral act now she seeks to rely on the further year of residence in germany that she has created
8352463 was intended to be permanently changed if not severed by the couple jointly
8352464 the closeness of the connection to a place is not the only or even a predominant factor or else the hague convention and its implementing legislation would be for nothing
8352465 if a parent has fled across the atlantic in an attempt to defeat the claim of the other parent to custody or access it hardly lies in that parents mouth to complain about a disadvantage from having to travel
8352466 in a typical exchange between a catholic and a protestant a catholic will say that we need a magisterium to rescue us from the vicissitudes of private judgment to which a protestant will counter that a catholic must apply his own private judgment to the interpretation of magisterial statements
8352467 apostolic hermeneutics and an evangelical doctrine of scripture moving beyond a modernist impasse
8352468 we agreed with every single one of the recommendations from the audit team we see it as a win win in making sure that we dont leave any rock unturned
8352469 we took all first degree felons outside of the county facilities so were trying to send a less violent offender out to the county facilities where we dont have complete control
8352470 we house 20 percent of our inmates in county facilities so its a tremendous amount of the population its vital that it succeeds
8352471 the department of corrections is accountable and well continue to look for vulnerabilities and well continue to aggressively address those to make our community safer

8352475 knowing it will go no where in a democrat controlled legislature
8352476 people are like hey he doesnt go on the internet
8352477 my answer thus far has been like if thats honestly what youre going to decide the election on thats cool if thats whats important to you
8352478 barack obama was first elected to the illinois senate in 1996 i remember that year
8352479 to say that i as a young person can remember a time when barack obama wasnt even in politics shows how inexperienced he may be
8352480 i didnt become a republican because you know i liked an elephant better than a donkey
8352481 i looked at the issues and i have an opinion on those issues and it just so happens the republicans share those same opinions
8352482 but when it comes to figuring out what theyre going to do and what our opinions are i feel like they dont see us as having enough life experience to know what were talking about
8352483 in our generation its really hard to be a staunch conservative
8352484 i had never heard the other side of the argument ever
8352485 on a lot of college campuses its more surprising to come out as a republican than to come out as gay
8352486 as consumers continue to embrace a truly digital lifestyle keeping that digital content backed up and secure is becoming more important than ever

8352489 john stossel sounds like a real defeatist we have our backs to the wall and hes raising the white flag
8352490 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8352491 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8352492 inconsistent with the purpose of the overall statutory scheme of the uccja to provide an efficient mechanism for mutual recognition and enforcement of custody decrees
8352493 would give every parent unhappy with a for eign custody decree one initial free pass at vio lating it
8352494 yes though i think qaumi tarana is not realy a punjabi composition
8352495 ben stiller es uno de los principales talentos del entretenimiento estadounidense un actor memorable un director y escritor exitoso ganador de un premio emmy y un productor innovador
8352496 a changeup unless it is johan or hamels like can not be relied upon as your top pitch thats all heilman has
8352497 huh jerry me youre not pulling me for schoe oh crap oh crap oh crap i suck im gonna blow it oh crap phew

8352508 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined

8352511 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8352512 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
8352513 a number of outlets try to make their business to turn her into a divisive problematic person

8352515 when mccain and bush get together in the twin cities itll be hard to tell them apart
8352516 no way no how no mccain barack obama must be our president
8352517 if theres what takes to defend all american citizens my son will fight for this country
8352518 although the republicans brought us two wars with no end in sight people think they are our best defenders
8352519 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8352520 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training
8352521 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8352522 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8352523 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8352524 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8352525 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8352526 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8352527 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8352528 i havent set any goals for the rest of the season
8352529 just try to get through the season injury free and go home and enjoy myself
8352530 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8352531 im still not yet at my full potential but im trying my best
8352532 i am still a long way from where i want to be
8352533 you know what i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam event and playing your best game in the first rounds
8352534 i think i want to grow every match playing better and better
8352535 today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me definitely im not in my best shape now and i havent been playing well before the u s open but grand slams kind of keep me much more motivated and i do much more better in grand slams
8352536 i was listening to the tv last night and they were saying that its not good for tennis if there is not a clear leader and its better to have for example henin
8352537 i dont know if i agree or not for players its different
8352538 to be player you want to see yourself or somebody else to have always a chance to be no 1 knowing that if you do a good job you can be there but definitely its a lot of nerves and we are all new
8352539 generations change so quick and we are all like 23 and younger justine left so everybody wants it but everybody is nervous its a bit of a funny situation but i think its interesting for everybody everybody learns so much from it
8352540 right now we feel like were going to let marcus williams handle the point
8352541 there will be a lot more discussion moving forward about that but we feel like well come up with a lot of different scenarios between coach don nelson and i the one thing we wont do is panic and do something just knee jerk
8352542 its not a good thing but again i think montas showed over the course of his short career his toughness and ability a lot of times to take some tough situations and make the best of them
8352543 this training camp was going to be an important part for his development no question its going to be pushed back obviously and weve just got to deal with that we dont think its a season ending injury but the time frame as we all know it fluctuates with various injuries
8352544 told me it was time to hand over the torch
8352545 thats what i do thats why i play basketball to improve and to become the best player who ever touched a basketball
8352546 id rather find a flaw in myself than a thousand in someone else

8352581 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field

8352604 has never signed on to efforts to overturn roe v wade
8352605 in 1973 the roe versus wade decision established a woman
8352606 more than thirty years ago the supreme courts decision in roe versus wade established a
8352607 if one of the u s supreme court justices retired would you want the new supreme court justice to be someone who would vote to overturn roe v wade
8352608 as you may know president bush may have the opportunity to appoint several new justices to the u
8352609 the 1973 supreme court ruling called roe v wade made abortion in
8352610 w hat i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said life begins at three months we dont know i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
8352611 and no i dont think this is something that voters should get to decide by a majority rule just like i dont think voters should be able to decide which free speech or free press rights or fair trial rights or worship and non worship rights and so on should exist by majority rule my faith in majorities isnt all that strong
8352612 most people the majorities you see reflected here are wary of tossing this decision back into the to the fractious unpredictable pit of the states and perhaps subjecting the right to any abortion to the will of an inflamed electorate inspired by well funded partisans majorities might like to tweak roe but theyd rather have a few later term abortions than run the risk of subjecting the right to choose at any stage of gestation to a vote
8352613 meeks repeatedly stressed that he didnt want the demonstration to disrupt classroom activities
8352614 the people in new trier understand that theres a problem
8352615 our goal is equality in funding but the pictures will a means to an end
8352616 parents who expect teachers to do all the work imparting knowledge enforcing discipline and creating an enthusiasm for learning in their children deserve a big dollop of blame for low test scores in certain schools

8352622 if you dont have anything good to say say it anyway
8352623 this is no big deal obama and ayers served on this board and were interested in advancing experimental ideas in education but it was a small enough part of obamas life and the personal connection slight enough that it wouldnt be fair to extrapolate anything from it
8352624 no there is no chance zero kurtzs eyebrows are already doing the rezko dance we can look for him and then all the other innuendo merchants in the land to find sinister and radical connections everywhere they look in these files to identify obama personally intimately with everyone remotely dubious with whom he associated and did not actively repudiate
8352625 lived in the same neighborhood and their kids went to school together
8352626 obamas leadership style and abilities are also sure to be illuminated by the documents in question
8352627 in actual fact i am not employing a figure of speech or exaggerating
8352628 my friends i dont have to tell you this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man im proud to call my friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack america
8352629 a man who will be the next president of the united states barack amer you know you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy
8352630 be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm
8352631 we shall not fail if we stand firm we shall not fail
8352632 and now its time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm
8352633 we shall not fail if we stand firm we shall not fail
8352634 we shall not fail if we stand firm we shall not fail wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it but sooner or later the victory is sure to come
8352635 a man who will be the next president of the united states of america barack obama
8352636 that quote attributed to abraham lincoln sounds more like something davy crockett would have said the fess parker version that is
8352637 be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm
8352638 at the chicago reception a little boy came into the room
8352639 be sure you put your feet in the right place then stand firm
8352640 now mrs pomroy if you will please put your feet just as i tell you you can
8352641 that quote attributed to abraham lincoln sounds more like something davy crockett would have said the fess parker version that is
8352642 john mccain and i have the experience to lead the country barack obama does not
8352643 if youre not going to vote for me then you have to vote for mccain
8352644 at the chicago reception a little boy came into the room life be sure you put your feet in the right place and then stand firm
8352645 how can you cover a convention when youre talking while the main speakers are speaking
8352646 when house speaker nancy pelosi was addressing the convention monday drawing a contrast between obama and republican sen
8352647 now we have nancy pelosi bloviating and i say that in an affectionate way behind us
8352648 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
8352649 its an embarrassment on both parties that they held most of their primary debates on fox cnn msnbc
8352650 the most obvious and blatant example is reporting on the war in georgia listen to one more hack lie for the white house
8352651 i like msnbc but i wanted to scream just shut the hell up already
8352652 at least he will not bankrupt this country by raising taxes and enlarging government
8352653 while he is not perfect at least he will not bankrupt this country by raising taxes and enlarging government
8352654 she claims bush is now using diplomacy instead of bullying and claimed they were following obamas advice
8352655 social programs destroyed the black family structure the inner city and will bankript social security and the country
8352656 definitely had conversations with microsoft about doing a new halo game
8352657 ive started a new project its big its like look at our line up and imagine something even bigger kind of big im directing it myself i cant mention it publicly yet when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one

8352661 we have a house and a few condos and some investment properties that i dont manage personally
8352662 old scool politicians and as good at playing the insiders games as anyone whose been in washington for years
8352663 mccain did nothing in congress for 25 years while the economy got worse
8352664 zorn reply eugene robinson of the washington post got off a good line that asking mccain how many houses he owns is like asking the average person how many umbrellas he owns
8352665 and now i give you the next president pause vice president of the united states joe biden
8352666 its root meaning is holding onto truth hence truth force i have also called it love force or soul force in the application of satyagraha i discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on ones opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and sympathy for what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other and patience means self suffering so the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth not by infliction of suffering on the opponent but on oneself
8352667 we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city va here in this beautiful sedona that i am blessed every moment that i can spend here our condominium in phoenix ariz and a place over in san diego
8352668 ive got a couple homes and a condo in california a couple in arizona and one in virginia
8352669 even if mccain was the same age as obama hes still a republican you know the party that has totally blown its turn at running the country a vote for mccain is a vote for never knowing what the hell went wrong
8352670 he leaves it up others to keep track his addresses
8352671 the more people learn about them and how they handle the pressure the more their support will erode
8352672 the mccain campaign talks about the lack of experience of obama is that not a jab at his age or lack of it if obama is too young cant mccain be too old
8352673 point of order shaun hoffmeyer no medal of honor for jfk he was awarded the navy and marine corps medal a mid level meritorious service medal for his actions after the pt 109 sinking and the purple heart for injuries received then his other medals are service awards for being in a particular theater of operations

8352676 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
8352677 oh my god its so horrible and we are powerless to do anything about it
8352678 can you believe the price of fuel these days its driving the price of everything up its putting us in a depression our leaders our only out for themselves
8352679 what is amazing to me is how good shape the world is in given the negative bias of the media imagine what shape we could be in if we taught the universal laws and turned off the media the love and freedom and prosperity and happiness that would ensue
8352680 critically but also very very sadly russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8352681 the president of russia has said he was not afraid of a new cold war we do not want a new cold war and he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8352682 i do not apologise for rejecting knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g8 or for eu russia relations to be broken but we do need to examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8352683 we believe we are strongly placed to deliver this much needed infrastructure
8352684 we estimate that to build a significant fibre optic network covering the auckland region would cost more than 1 billion
8352685 this is clearly a significant investment and one that could take shape in a number of different ways depending on the nature and structure of broadband investment funds proposed this option will remain a key area of focus for us
8352686 we understand those assets and we are assessing our options in that space
8352687 i think its also important to note that we have a share buyback in place and that provides a valuable investment option for us

8352717 this happened more than once but it seems to me that it was always a summer afternoon when our parents would pull out of the driveway with the three of us waving from the top of the hill with our arms around each other

8352728 i want to encourage all of our veterans returning from iraq and afghanistan to take advantage of the new programs that are available and get the education and benefits you deserve
8352729 just when i began to think that the universitys outreach to first responders had peaked i realized that there was another group of first responders who were having a very difficult time the men and women in the armed services in iraq and afghanistan these volunteer first responders put their lives on the line in service to their country and deserve our gratitude and our help

8352783 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8352784 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8352785 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8352786 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8352787 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8352788 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8352789 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8352813 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8352814 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8352815 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8352816 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8352817 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8352845 from what i understand from cea interactions in denver the interesting takeaway is the number of policy makers who say they agree on trade but report how difficult the political environment is
8352846 hopefully once the political season is over well see a less charged environment and the trade agreements can be considered at that time

8352904 there was some shaping but what the editor wanted was more of everything
8352905 which is a testament to what mary ann had created
8352906 that writing group was a ruse not unlike the guernsey literary society created for the express purpose of getting mary ann to write
8352907 they knew she would be forced to produce something when it was her turn
8352908 no one quite knew why germany expended so much energy on the channel islands
8352909 i drifted off into the underbrush and bumped up against german battlements
8352910 my favorite part came as we drove from st peter port to the town of st martins coming out of the city and into the countryside
8352911 there i could see that ineffable what it looks like that i needed so badly when i was writing
8352912 something halfway between normandy and the northern california coast craggy gray cliffs rolling green fields leaping bunnies old houses covered in rose vines
8352913 it was everything i had hoped it would be not only in order to be correct but in order to love it
8352914 to celebrate the pursuit of ecodesign through an international competition to utilize waste material
8352915 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of wanna be material girls
8352916 we have no evidence yet that madonna knows anything about this
8352917 as onenewsnow points out and as i pointed out previously this bill would bar all unmarried couples from adopting
8352918 the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only object of good government
8352919 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8352920 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8352921 isnt it funny roger how the arrested development of those weve ahem left behind is so screamingly obvious
8352922 supongo que quer an algo bien definido y aburrido cuando saque mi versi n y estoy tentada de hacerlo el mismo d a ser el mayor xito
8352923 por el momento todo lo que s es que tengo el enorme placer de tocar e improvisar con los otros dos page y jones y empezar a trabajar con nuevo material

8352925 isnt it funny roger how the arrested development of those weve ahem left behind is so screamingly obvious
8352926 em lia scrubbed her soles with boiled water and a loofah in order to make them white the way a ladys feet should look but the stains remained
8352927 for what she did not know not death that would have already come to her slowly and stealthily killing her little by little each day of her lonely existence
8352928 their gums bled their hair lost its pigment turning a sickly orange and falling out in knotted clumps luzias men and women began to look like terrified animals a clear slime ran from their noses their faces were gaunt and their eyes bulged the whites turned yellow
8352929 luzia felt something harden inside her like warm molasses poured into wooden blocks and set in the cold night to solidify
8352930 its not our business to build a cpu were a visual computing company and i think the reason weve survived the other 35 companies who were making graphics at the start is that weve stayed focused
8352931 are we likely to build a cpu and take out intel
8352932 the processing elements the fabrics the interconnects some special function units some i o some memory controllers then go and look at a gpu from five years ago
8352933 youll see the special function units the i o the memory controllers we built larrabee five years ago
8352934 it is treacherous water and it builds something for you
8352935 chicago is famous for its politics because its up front in its style and i mean that also in its substance he went from a loss then came back and then is advancing
8352936 the most important thing is that barack communicates that barack knows more about the american people than the people getting something about barack
8352937 as for experience arguably the greatest president in all history abraham lincoln had two years experience when he ran for president
8352938 if you go through presidents and look at what makes the great ones probably a length of time in the united states congress doesnt help too much same with governorships
8352939 kansas and oklahoma and texas all through these areas where most of the cows are going to be grazing on dormant forage during the winter months rangeland such as the tall grass prairies in this area proteins going to be our first limiting nutrient and so we then limit that portfolio to which of these supplement options will provide protein at the best cost for the operation

8352943 het is er een grote puinhoop alles is overhoop gehaald
8352944 de marechaussee had de leiding en besloot wat de beste manier was om te handelen
8352945 zon verhaal kun je nog wel twee uur volhouden maar dit duurde te lang mensen zien dat er niets aan de kist gebeurt
8352946 on his web site was arrested wednesday and appeared in court where his bail was set at 10 000
8352947 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8352948 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting
8352949 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be
8352950 if you like to dance this is a great venue
8352951 this is a great opportunity for those who love to dance and meet new people get up off your backside and come on out
8352952 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them i want to be like that
8352953 everyone from a senator can enjoy it to a bum on the street its available to everyone
8352954 were making more art for the people rather than the super high end stuff
8352955 they dont wear corporate logos for anybody theyre going to endorse obama the way they want
8352956 everyone wants to use their own voice to endorse obama
8352957 the doctors have assured us that there was no need for any concern all he needs is good rest and check ups
8352958 he is not feeling very well and it is mainly due to fatigue
8352959 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8352960 after our success with the aja kona cards on no country for old men there was no question that we would make them a part of our workflow with final cut studio on burn after reading said david diliberto associate producer for the film
8352961 this combination created such a stable platform for us that we changed very little in our set up from the last movie this time around we cut using apples prores codec which has bigger file sizes and higher resolution images than the dvcpro hd codec we used on no country for old men the kona cards also made processing quicktimes out of final cut very efficient
8352962 once again we are very satisfied customers and the aja kona 3 cards will be used on joel and ethans next movie the serious man which starts shooting next month
8352963 das ist die grundlage auf die die f r den menschen einzigartigen formen von altruismus kooperation und norm der fairness gebaut sind
8352964 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the uk and the aggressive and unprecedented intervention in the apparently functioning adjudicatory processes of a longtime ally of the uk in contravention of well established principles of international comity
8352965 no movement on the central question where was mr mohamed between 2002 and 2004
8352966 theres a saying that no two countries that support the golden arches have ever been at war
8352967 admittedly we are shifting in the kinds of jobs but generally they are higher paying jobs
8352968 the biggest reason jobs go away is not because of free trade but advances in technology that change the way we do things
8352969 the expansion of trade and global supply chains has undoubtedly played a role
8352970 there is no doubt that globalization has brought significant benefits to american consumers
8352971 its lowered prices on goods once considered luxuries from big screen tvs to peaches in winter and increased the purchasing power of low income americans
8352972 barack obama supports a trade policy that ensures our goods and services are treated fairly in foreign markets at the same time trade policy must stay consistent with our commitment to demand improved labor and environmental practices worldwide
8352973 from what i understand from cea interactions in denver the interesting takeaway is the number of policy makers who say they agree on trade but report how difficult the political environment is
8352974 hopefully once the political season is over well see a less charged environment and the trade agreements can be considered at that time
8352975 free trade is in fact a message that the democrats new leadership could very well embrace
8352976 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8352977 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8352978 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8352979 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8352980 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8352981 this partnership creates an exciting new service for our fans closing the loop between the entertainment choices we spotlight and our audiences ability to connect directly to those entertainment experiences

8353005 we are currently in production in atlanta and three models did not show up
8353006 these tickets were non refundable and non transferable causing us to lose money on top of precious time for filming we are not interested in giving irresponsible models a second chance if a model does not have the money or a credit card to fly to new york with this is a red flag that the individual is reckless and therefore not particularly likely to show up this is a person i wouldnt want to work with in our case one model did not arrive at the airport on time another model was suddenly sick an hour before their flights departure time and a third simply did not board their plane and failed to notify the crew that they would not attend the shoot

8353041 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
8353042 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
8353043 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
8353044 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
8353045 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
8353046 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
8353047 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
8353048 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
8353049 were going to play against some really good players and theres really good coaches on other teams as well
8353050 so theres going to be good schemes and sometimes were not going to be at our best but youve got to learn from those mistakes and youve got to understand that theyre going to happen and youve got to bounce back from them as quickly as you can

8353061 the problem i had is that when i examined judge roberts record and history of public service it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak in his work in the white house and the solicitor generals office he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process in these same positions he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man

8353106 the winning pieces will be displayed and celebrated at a reception and ceremony on october 14 2008 from 6 to 8 p m at the artjaz gallery 51 n 2nd street wine and refreshments will be served and the cause of preventing domestic abuse will be honored that sunday october 19 lsh will be hosting festival of hope
8353107 we recognize that there has been a change in the executive office in philadelphia but the view of the current director of commerce for the city does not affect or undermine the legitimate exercise of the authority reposed in the former director of commerce
8353108 were obviously thrilled with the decision we have the best site and are excited to move forward
8353109 we are scheduled to sit down with the mayor and several other figures after labor day to discuss our future plans we respect the process and look forward to working through this and getting started with construction as soon as possible
8353110 this is the news that weve been waiting for now we just hope that the city will abide by the law and help to move the process along
8353111 this is a very small setback that will cause us to get stronger long ago we lost confidence in the supreme court and by now many others including our local representatives have as well so politically speaking this court ruling doesnt mean very much at all
8353112 we thought that we had a good argument but it didnt go our way our law department will be analyzing our options and well go from there
8353113 were not surprised at the supreme courts ruling but we are certainly disappointed we will be working closely with the mayors office to decide upon the next step
8353114 walter ha fatto pi danni di cia e gelli insieme
8353115 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8353116 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible
8353117 weve got to run the football especially early in the game to take pressure off our quarterback and young receivers
8353118 we want to establish the run then maybe stick in the running backs belly and get behind some people with the play action passes the team thats won this game has been the team that ran the football and controlled the clock well count on our defense to give us some short fields so that we can pound the ball at those guys
8353119 we know its the first big game for our quarterback and a lot of our receivers so we feel as an experienced group we need to open those running lanes and set the tempo for the game
8353120 were supposed to be one of the strengths of the team so well have to come out and put it on our shoulders
8353121 coming off that rock and knocking somebody down that gets you hyped up and quiets their crowd down
8353122 you can get fired up pass blocking too but i think its definitely more when you open up big holes and the backs break off a big run
8353123 im sorry but the university does not feel that this subject is sufficiently worthy of scientific investigation
8353124 these are the earliest copies of the bible ever found
8353125 the bible is sacred to us and to you and to all the monotheistic religions and therefore the scrolls are national treasures and world treasures and therefore it is our duty to preserve them at least for 2 000 years more
8353126 they show the connection between christianity judaism and how everything evolved from the god the god is one god
8353127 just by applying the latest infrared technologies and shooting at very high detail lots of resolution we are already opening up new characters from the scrolls that are either extremely indistinct or you just couldnt see them before
8353128 to switch over to digital is really the way to go and people were resistant to it initially because it was a new way of doing stuff
8353129 you can see where the ink has broken away and you can see the texture of the animal skin so you can see more detail than you can see with the naked eye
8353130 we are very excited to join forces with the don moen company to better serve the church and we believe this relationship will allow us to significantly expedite our product development process we are looking forward to increasing our customer service capabilities as well as introducing several important new software releases in the months ahead
8353131 i can make it to the finish line and from what i can see some of you can too
8353132 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
8353133 desaconsejamos que se repita el premio formentor y presentamos un proyecto que creemos tiene aportaci n intelectual
8353134 algo novedoso como lo fueron en su momento las conversaciones y los premios de formentor y no intentar hacer un mal remedo a algo irrecuperable
8353135 hemos llegado a la conclusi n de que el esp ritu de formentor no ven a del otorgamiento de los premios sino de la riqueza de la discusi n el di logo entre lenguas y el cambio de perspectiva cultural que supuso

8353155 but while the evidence of his spotty post 1970s work is hard to refute

8353160 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other
8353161 the best fitting structure of each type for a given data set and then picks the type of structure that best represents the data
8353162 we think of children as taking in data forming theories and testing those theories with experiments
8353163 theyre like little scientists until now theres been no good computational model for how children can like scientists grasp the underlying global structure of a set of data

8353184 me encuentro bastante bien en pek n no jugu mal pero me faltaron m s partidos porque sal de la operaci n y a la semana estaba jugando en los juegos pero cuando he podido entrenar me he vuelto a meter en competici n y he podido conseguir una victoria que por ser la primera despu s de la operaci n la considero bastante importante y me va a dar confianza en lo que resta de temporada
8353185 la operaci n me rompi porque ven a jugando muy bien era el 11 del mundo y el 6 de la race y fue un palo pero las cosas vienen as y ahora tengo que tratar recuperar el nivel de principio de la temporada
8353186 ven a sacando muy bien antes de la operaci n en roland garros tuve el r cord de aces y aqu he empezado sacando tambi n bastante bien es un aspecto de mi juego que he tratado de mejorar sobre todo de cara a los grand slams porque son partidos a cincos sets y cuando mejor saques m s puntos tienes gratis y ahorras esfuerzos
8353187 tambi n me quedo con que la actitud ha sido positiva y con el juego de derecha que ha sido agresivo y he conseguido restar bien y eso me ha permitido la victoria
8353188 tipsarevic era m s favorito si hubiera estado en condiciones que warburg hoy he calentado con warberg y es un jugador que saca bastante bien por lo que he podido ver y que est m s acostumbrado que yo a este tipo de superficies y pelota pero tratar de dar lo mejor mi mismo y sumar otra victoria
8353189 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
8353190 youre talking about roughly 45 billion of reserves insuring 4 5 trillion of deposits
8353191 and youre in an environment right now where non current loans delinquent loans are increasing at a faster pace than banks putting aside reserves thats not a good thing
8353192 youve got a risk of siphoning off capital when its needed
8353193 obviously i was lied to when signing papers and those who sold me the house knew i would be unable to afford the house
8353194 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8353195 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8353196 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8353197 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8353198 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8353199 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8353200 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8353201 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8353202 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8353203 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8353204 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8353205 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8353206 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8353207 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8353208 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8353209 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8353210 despite all of the obstacles and the conscientious objections the service is working
8353211 doctors nurses and social workers have lived up to the commitment with a lot of generosity
8353212 we have the right to choose about our body but we dont have the right to end the life of a human being
8353213 they are not thinking about the psychological damage that the girls who have abortions go through
8353214 would be a historic ruling that recognizes the importance of this problem from the point of view of public health and womens rights
8353215 cuba permits abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy as does the united states
8353216 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8353217 we recognize his responsibilities in california and well certainly work with him regarding scheduling should that issue arise
8353218 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using
8353219 whenever people have had oil they have been really really willing to give it its a waste product for them so we are taking away their rubbish

8353253 more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
8353254 the decline in print has been so pervasive that its taking the online stuff with it
8353255 julys digital results were due to a relative weak month in display advertising coupled with weaker than expected help wanted advertising across the news media group
8353256 we are expecting better performance in display advertising at nytimes com in august to date in august online advertising for the news media group is trending up in the low double digits
8353257 think about that as a solid print base to lever yourself into your digital future

8353268 we have some news concerning the upcoming tours of nile vader and unleashed
8353269 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8353270 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8353271 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8353272 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8353273 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8353274 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8353275 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8353276 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8353277 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8353278 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8353279 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8353280 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug

8353298 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8353299 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now
8353300 her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
8353301 she has clearly set her sights on governor and looks at that as the way she wants to complete her long and distinguished career of public service
8353302 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8353303 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment

8353393 if the only way you can continue with an ongoing task is in a spirit of resignation and bitterness its probably time for you to stop
8353394 speaking as a defensive player i was not happy with us we have got to make sure we do not play too open
8353395 we still have quite a bit to do and we have to build from the back forward

8353397 i was disappointed and i have moved on and im focused on the a league and i think were going to give it a real good shake this year
8353398 i think we play pretty good football and we play for the crowd
8353399 weve got a good squad and built it from last year

8353406 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8353407 the permatang pauh by election is one by election that cannot be interpreted as something that can happen in other constituencies i believe we can still continue the government
8353408 and for two terms it was represented by his wife datin seri dr wan azizah wan ismail so now the constituency returns to him
8353409 i dont think so i think there are other things which he promised to reduce the fuel price racial issues in our country which drew the attention of certain parties
8353410 no bn members wll not leave the bn just like that if there are problems within the coalition we resolve them

8353426 while kashmiris in the valley vehemently opposed the move the fascist hindu organization rss orchestrated violent protests in jammu region
8353427 by doing so the latter has succeeded in completely communalizing the issue
8353428 the government has utterly failed in amicably solving the issue the state is in utter shambles
8353429 the situation is alarming it is no more the handiwork of the terrorists from across the border or the mercenaries hired by isi as has too often been claimed by the government of india
8353430 the voices of azadi are fast becoming the popular will there is no denying the fact that the kashmir valley is speaking for itself and not a mouthpiece of neighboring pakistan
8353431 no amount of physical force can browbeat and crush the political aspirations of people state terrorism has never been a solution to a political problem encouraging communal outfits like rss to stage manage a parallel agitation can prove to be suicidal for the country rss has always played the politics of hate towards minorities in indian and the clich s like patriotism nationalism integrity etc merely tend to serve as trump cards a mere coating for hindutava

8353442 this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8353443 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8353444 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8353445 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8353446 we welcome derrick and will work hard to get him up to speed as quickly as possible
8353447 i know that derrick has been anxious to get here its good for him and also for us to have this done as we finish up the preseason and prepare to start the season
8353448 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do

8353565 better does not necessarily mean more entertaining if you want entertainment you play twenty20 cricket
8353566 that has to be the judgment these changes have been made with a view to entertainment not to improving rugby
8353567 if the game is played well and refereed well there is nothing wrong with it
8353568 john oneill australian rugby union chief executive is the greatest supporter of the changes and the pressure on rugby in australia is to win fans
8353569 theyre competing directly against aussie rules rugby league and football
8353570 all three are simple motion games where the ball is always in play to compete the super 14 has become a quick tap motion game
8353571 the ball is in play a lot but that doesnt create a better game it creates entertainment to the detriment of rugby
8353572 now theres test match cricket and twenty20 cricket but we need to keep test match rugby around the world most people want to watch test rugby
8353573 there are pockets around the world who want to see twenty20 cricket so lets make twenty12 rugby we could have 12 players 20 minutes each way with no scrums or line outs
8353574 as the game becomes more professional another form of the game could develop sevens hasnt been a success as entertainment
8353575 in our pre season games the laws have not made a massive amount of difference
8353576 but what has been crucial is that the referees have been concentrating on them and not on other aspects of the game which make it function
8353577 if you have done your homework on them then hopefully you will have your game plan in place and you will have a good understanding as to what they have to offer
8353578 cantors selection would be welcomed by conservatives applauded by most moderates and inspire confusion and revealingly insulting attacks from the left
8353579 it would elevate a strong young voice for principled conservative reform to the national stage not merely for political gain but because he deserves the platform and it would cement mccains election as something that is not just a block against four years of obama biden but a positive good for the center right coalition for the future
8353580 im trying really hard to step up to the plate and change your reputation
8353581 you are not the devil but you guys have to do that yourselves
8353582 ill be damned if i end up in a wheelchair
8353583 people think oh hes just crazy he didnt mean it

8353587 its a hand picked team of people where i was cherry picking the best in the company because of that what seemed like an impossible design at the beginning started to seem probable and then likely and now positive and at every turn the team has exceeded my expectations about what they could deliver both technologically and design wise
8353588 normally im art directing artists but this is a game where im spending all my time art directing engineers its not the artists who are making this directly its the engineers that are making the systems so you have to figure out what you need to do to make it so that a player or procedural system can make something like this
8353589 quickly and easily its kind of freakish in that regard usually im telling the artists make it bluer but here youre telling the engineers can we get some way to seam these two things together procedurally or we need to run an ambient occlusion pass on this so the shadows sync up so its an odd job
8353590 well the whole sandbox ideology for games is predicated on the player diverging so if the player doesnt diverge weve wasted so much work
8353591 oh my god the player damn well better diverge otherwise we could have just given them a level game
8353592 there are edge cases of course where players might push themselves into corners where stuff behaves badly or unexpectedly but im not worried about that in fact thats where were figuring the majority of the long term replayability of the game is if its just
8353593 and youre done with the game great but were hoping if its anything like simcity or the sims that people do that for 8 or 10 hours and then wonder hmm i wonder what would have happened if id done that at that point and will explore the branching and the state space of what the game provides both in terms of things that you can build and things you can manipulate in your direction creatures or other civilizations
8353594 we dont for the most part author levels rather we have made machines that make levels when you come down to a planet part of the challenge that were dealing with is making those visually compelling so youre not like oh another one you really want to see something where you feel like theres intelligence behind the aesthetic decisions and of course make them viable gameplay levels so if you go to a planet the interaction isnt just oh its pretty ok im going thats something thats a bear of a problem and something that were still chewing on and manipulating
8353595 one of wills themes that were depending on heavily is if youre going to fail fail funny the hope is if you start making some crazy ass creature like this guy
8353596 has 11 legs you have no idea how an 11 legged creature would walk so if he stumbles over himself its like hey thats on purpose if we can hit one animation that works for 80 percent of the creatures do a couple others that suck up the last 15 percent and the remaining five percent fail humorously then were golden
8353597 actually were going to have inter stellar alliances and youre going to be able to interact with any level of planet that you come across from barren to wild to tribal city civ each ones going to have kind of different game dynamics
8353598 once you get into interacting with other space faring races its a broader palette of options at that point you can choose to attack them form an alliance trade or get missions therell be missions generated at that level but i think the relationship game at the interstellar level is going to be an elaboration of the relationship game that we have down at the civilization level where i have a nation with good or bad relationships i might be trading partners with these guys i might be culturally trying to influencing these guys and attacking those guys all the way back to the tribal level where its very simple little interactions between the tribes this relationship structure that starts at the tribal level in a very simple way gets elaborated into city civ and then into space where it probably gets the most elaborate
8353599 the advancement between levels is always optional for the player the player is the one that pulls the trigger on the advancement so if they want to stay at creature level they can stay there as long as they want to its up to them to pull the trigger on advancing to tribe we fully expect that certain players will enjoy certain levels more than others and also once you get to space game you can in some ways revisit levels from that point of view so if you really enjoyed he creature ecology game you can genetically engineer creatures for free now in the editor and use them to populate worlds
8353600 when i was first pitching the idea for the sims and it was about taking out the trash and cleaning the toilets everybody said thats exactly what would fail its too domestic why would anyone want to play that game
8353601 i think its almost more about accessibility so that somebody without a lot of knowledge of tolkien or d amp d or military history can come in start pressing buttons and having an enjoyable time and then learn the game
8353602 the primary thing is it needs to be something where theyre getting instant reward that they dont have a hardcore npc coming and kicking their butt every 5 minutes and that they can go off in the direction that they want to go off that might be the creative direction of spending a lot of time decorating their creature it might be the strategy direction of tuning their city just right and doing the layout or it might be the more like mmo experience in the ufo going around collecting rares and trading
8353603 i think a more personal message is that everybody has in some sense a universe inside of them in their imagination that with the right toolset they can pour it out and instantiate it
8353604 the first time i ever played myst this beautifully rendered world i was moving around and the first thing that occurred to me was you know somebody had a blast building this world and i would love to have the toolset to build a world like that i think thats a deeper message that everybody has more creativity in them that they think they have
8353605 i keeping hearing that no mater how terrible your design itll function everything is cosmetic
8353606 i want you to help us doing it alone is like one hand clapping
8353607 we hope to attract a great number of customers who will be able to see the whole city and enjoy the restaurants and pools on ground below
8353608 we are extremely pleased with this years international congress on 3 d dental imaging
8353609 the level of participation and attendance from some of the industrys top doctors reflects very strong interest in 3 d dental imaging technology imaging sciences is thrilled to have brought this event to the dental community for a second year in a row as more and more practitioners adopt 3 d technology as the standard of care we will continue to provide the dental community with education and information dedicated to improving diagnosis and patient care
8353610 bill will help us expand and capitalize on the renewable efforts already under way at our business units by developing a coordinated strategy across the corporation
8353611 he will help us develop a better understanding of the renewable resources market that is evolving in this country and build an investment strategy that can provide solid shareholder returns
8353612 in addition our business units will be affected by legislation and regulations that address carbon emissions and renewable energy bill will help us develop a strategy to operate successfully in this environment and to identify business opportunities that might arise as a result of the legislative and regulatory actions
8353613 storage and backup are increasingly critical for small and medium sized companies since data loss can actually drive a company out of business
8353614 now any organization can protect data which can literally mean the difference between success and failure for as little as 5 per month at this affordable rate theres no excuse to leave critical data unprotected
8353615 we need to pursue every opportunity possible to help our students learn english well enough to not only communicate from a social standpoint but from an academic standpoint as well
8353616 curriculum like champion of ideas that teaches english with these factors in mind is a cornerstone of our english immersion curriculum
8353617 the highest quality of language and grammatical accuracy is the goal for english learners using the champion of ideas program
8353618 because the method used in the champion program is systematic and methodical spoken and written language will not mirror grammatical gaps in learning
8353619 there arent many application processing solutions that could handle our needs but cypress mark iv offers the flexibility we require to manage credit card applications for our agent banks across the united states
8353620 we were very impressed with cypress lending knowledge and personal interaction with our management team mark iv should help us significantly increase our processing efficiency and reduce our costs to originate new credit card accounts
8353621 with the ongoing economic turmoil more consumers are facing credit challenges so we want to compile a complete credit picture for applicants before we make a decision mark iv easily assembles and reports that information
8353622 were excited that tcm bank has signed as a mark iv client
8353623 we offer our hosted version of mark iv as an alternative to our licensed version so institutions like tcm bank can witness the full benefits of our technology without incurring costs for additional servers and other necessary equipment
8353624 i would be quite surprised if we didnt reach triple digits
8353625 most of them are going to be relatively small institutions but they will add up
8353626 i fully expect the fdic insurance fund to be depleted
8353627 the fdic is going to be one of what is going to be an increasing string of government bailouts
8353628 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terrorism

8353715 ha habido una oferta del real madrid por el jugador de m s de 40 millones de euros
8353716 la verdad es que durante el ltimo mes y medio han sucedido muchas cosas en mi cabeza y en mi entorno cosas que no hab a vivido antes y para las que no s si estaba preparado
8353717 he de agradecer al valencia el gesto que ha hecho por m y al club todo lo que me ha dado desde que llegu hace tres a os el presidente se ha esforzado por darme cari o en los momentos que m s lo necesitaba y yo espero seguir dando el m ximo rendimiento e incluso mejorarlo
8353718 la cl usula era de 150 millones de euros y nunca iba a mover un dedo para salir del valencia
8353719 si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu mi actual club no ha aceptado una oferta de mucho dinero y eso para mi es un orgullo en definitiva no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir de mestalla
8353720 mi evoluci n como jugador puede ser igual aqu que en el real madrid de lo contrario nunca hubiese firmado mi renovaci n espero devolver el cari o que esta afici n me da en cada entrenamiento y en cada partido
8353721 conozco a cazorla y a iker bromas de esas solemos gastar a diario
8353722 estic molt content de estar a i hui amunt valencia

8353878 being on stage is such a thrill and its great to be a part of an ea video game that lets girls experience how much fun it is to express themselves and explore their own creativity by performing
8353879 boogie superstar represents a new level in the convergence of games and music
8353880 ea has combined the very best game interactive capabilities of the wii technology and the boogie brand to form an unprecedented soundtrack with the hottest new tracks made famous by the biggest artists in the world today weve been actively involved in natashas career since its inception and were proud to have a star like her actively involved
8353881 hillarys speech a success in the hall was a study in the virtue of low expectations
8353882 id say that sen clinton has had the best performance so far by a wide margin both in terms of attacking john mccain and the republicans head on and defining a nauseatingly comprehensive set of plans for raising taxes getting mad at companies for shipping job overseas and pushing universal health care or more accurately even more expensive and less effective health care
8353883 she started out a little dull and a little self obsessed but then she rallied a little no way no how no mccain was a good line and the twin cities analogy was a great little riff on bush and mccain but i have to say her speaking style although much improved over even a year ago is still a little flat when shes passionate she has little inflection when shes quieter shes a little drony the keep going theme moreover was a little unnerving a thinly veiled threat
8353884 stunning hillary rodham clintons convention speech on tuesday was so not what barack obama needed
8353885 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8353886 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8353887 we were all very interested to see her reasons for supporting barack obama and so i think its very clear tonight that she was a strong messenger that we have to change our country and that its ok even though we supported hillary clinton in the past to unite behind barack obama
8353888 even though i cant vote im trying my best to support obama and get the word out about how great he is and what an inspiration hes going to be
8353889 ive met a lot of women who switched from hillary to mccain just because they were upset so i think its really really important that she came here its a great thing she had everyone on their feet clapping for her it was an inspiring speech and i think that it spoke to everyone

8353928 ci sono una serie di contatti non una situazione negativamente chiusa ma in movimento lobiettivo di tutti ha spiegato di trovare una soluzione che dia continuit ma questo passa per accordi contrattuali ruoli e funzioni
8353929 the situation with robbie is still up in the air
8353930 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8353931 we announce today that david villa and valencia will remain together for many years to come
8353932 in the last month and a half lots of things have happened around me that i have not experienced before
8353933 i want to thank valencia for this gesture i am very grateful to this club for what they have given me and i hope to continue to give good performances
8353934 right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to london to sign a contract
8353935 i am grateful to valencia for this gesture and for all that the club has given me and to vicente soriano for the effort he has made
8353936 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8353937 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8353938 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team
8353939 this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8353940 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8353941 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8353942 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8353943 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8353944 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8353945 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8353946 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8353947 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8353948 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8353949 toby i will never again put one dime into your pocket you drank the koolaid that is destroying the

8353970 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8353971 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa

8354019 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane

8354034 this is something i never even thought id ever hear about paul but i really feel bad for him that this one bad decision gets blown up so much i dont think thats justified
8354035 i think he is more worried about his future in wrestling than anything else and this is the last thing he wanted to deal with as his senior year is coming up
8354036 the last thing he wanted to do was leave nebraska paul is one of the hardest working athletes i know and is a great student too nothing is going to keep him from going after his goal of winning another ncaa championship
8354037 i really didnt want to get into the reasons he did this
8354038 i just wanted to keep our conversation simple and supportive
8354039 i really feel bad for paul bad decision or not
8354040 i cant imagine what hes going through im sure hes in a lot of pain but the paul i know is going to deal with it and concentrate on the future

8354058 maybe it was a dual intention where microsoft knew they would have to pay immersion eventually but at the same time they could help keep sony in litigation with immersion
8354059 its hard to tell clearly immersions technology is worth something because microsoft and sony both settled
8354060 microsoft received some compensation they were looking for and immersion was added as a business partner
8354061 immersion does touch and microsoft will be developing new touch products over the next six to 12 months
8354062 so being a certified partner gives immersion the opportunity to be a part of those projects at some point microsoft is planning to make touch a big part of their strategy look at the iphone and the samsung instinct touch is becoming a bigger part of the way users interact with devices
8354063 sony paid immersion for damages for patent infringement the royalty sony currently pays as part of the settlement is 750 000 per quarter and thats ongoing

8354093 speaking to key leadership personalities and assessing them is critical to what happens inside adhamiyah

8354113 what a pity to see a party like cpi m the party of jyoti basu and harkishan surjeet tolerating the stubborn and egocentric karat family
8354114 joining with communal forces to destabilize the nation against secular forces
8354115 they have not betrayed the upa or the congress they have betrayed the nation
8354116 they want their personal prestige to have overriding effect on national prestige
8354117 the cpi m and the left parties have extended support to the upa government to ensure that there is a secular government at the centre further in the present situation after the ouster of the bjp from the central government it is important to continue to work for the isolation of the bjp and its allies so as to prevent a comeback by these forces
8354118 after fighting anti people policies of the congress party and the congress governments for 45 years we have along with other left parties extended outside support to the congress led upa government at the centre in order to keep the communal forces out of power
8354119 for the congress variety leadership justice is a matter of political expediency and calculation if you can get votes by promising to implement the commission do it after that once you come to power see what are the benefits of prosecuting the riot culprits if the electoral calculations tell you keeping quiet on these issues is better keep quiet about it and sincerely pursue the cases of blasts which have followed the riots which as a matter of fact are an aftermath of the riots the honesty of punishing the guilty upholding the law is gradually a virtue disappearing from the public arena the state congress leadership thinks it can fool the victims all the time but the question is how long can congress sustain policies which betray the victims which are against the promises and oath which they take while grabbing the seats of power
8354120 our supporters have not had a lot to shout about in the eight or nine years they have been out of the premier league but i think it is important that we get to christmas and if were in the top 12 we need to set a target to be pushing the guys
8354121 i dont know what got into my head but i decided that i needed to know once and for all what big was really trying to do on that night before christmas i drove to bigs house on a mission to find out where i really stood the security guard at the gate just waved me in when i pulled up it was christmas eve and shed seen me come into the complex with the kids so i guess she didnt think anything of it i parked in the rear of bigs town house and walked up to the garage it was locked i hadnt been over to bigs house a whole lot but i did know that you jiggle the garage door a certain way and unlock it
8354122 i got into the garage where there was an elevator that would take me to both floors of bigs duplex there i was rocking a black skully cap and a heavy goose down jacket tiptoeing into the elevator and pressing the button to go up to the second floor where his bedroom was located i got to bigs bedroom door turned the knob and went inside as soon as i saw a small lump next to bigs large frame i flew into a rage ran over to the side of the bed and pulled back the covers i grabbed some chick out of the bed and started beating her ass at some point the chicks wig came off in my hand it was a short cropped wig i stopped throwing punches for a minute to get a good look at the chick i was beating up it was lil kim she was completely butt naked yelling as i pushed her around the room

8354144 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government
8354145 it is irresponsible to engage in that dialogue while you are a sitting official and taking an oath to be a representative of the u s government

8354148 i feel so blessed that they came out as good as they did
8354149 i loved the johnny cash records the edginess the rawness of them but i dont think thats glen
8354150 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
8354151 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written
8354152 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell
8354153 i picked the ones that i wanted to sing and the rest of it was a piece of cake
8354154 i dont know why im the first person to do this with glen but its long overdue
8354155 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8354156 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8354157 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8354158 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8354159 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8354160 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8354161 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8354162 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8354163 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8354164 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8354165 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips
8354166 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8354167 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8354168 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8354169 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8354170 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8354171 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8354172 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8354173 my clients intentions are to make restitution to the mud which they have diligently served for years

8354205 artists may be pushed to create works because they have received commercial success and cease to take chances or risks once they have figured a formula and that is when you start to see works being churned out to cater to a large demand
8354206 in recent years in the so called post modern world the old divisions have lost their influence or relevance this is due to the forces released by the communication industry that cross lace forms once chronologically or geographically separate in a sense its techniques have changed even the basic nature of art practice leading progressively towards collaboration and multi media work and edging out the importance of individualised autography this has put art on the production line and given the art object the profile of a commodity be it a privileged commodity on another side our burgeoning economy has spawned a whole crowd of speculators who want to trade in this commodity through art galleries and auction houses in the same way as they trade in shares they have generally no inkling of or interest in a works aesthetic merit their main concern is their resale value even those among them who are more informed and sensitive prefer to keep mum and submit to the market trends in the overall picture the artists have a better deal they are no more lean and hungry they attend lavish parties and get featured in the social columns of dailies and periodicals is this part of the cultural resurgence we have been speaking of or what some of those path breaking thinkers of pre independent india had tried to visualise unfortunately not
8354207 but the winds of change we are riding on do not seem to be taking us in that direction but this is important the new economic well being of certain sections of our people who are willing to be cyber slaves of some developed societies in a globalising world should not divert us from this main objective clerks and managers can move around but artists and culture workers need solid links with their root space to produce works of authority and resonance

8354232 is that because karunanidhi tamil nadu chief minister and sonia congress party chairperson hate the hinduism
8354233 where the faith is hurt development project has to give way
8354234 by sending one million ex servicemen to settle in the valley for good give them the necessary weapons to defend themselves and also an amount of rs 5 lakh each to build their homes
8354235 if the terrorists bomb our temples then send the army to take over the mosque built on the kashi vishwanath temple and restore the entire area to lord shiva
8354236 let us send a column of indian army from khulna to sylhet in bangladesh and annex the top one third of that nation as the compensation
8354237 nowhere in the world was the problem of terrorism ever tackled through talks with the terrorists
8354238 he azad had once said that bullet for bullet was the only way to solve the problem of terrorism you have to kill the terrorists or else they will kill you
8354239 thousands of innocent people have been killed in india due to terrorism
8354240 it was wrong to say that hinduism is merely a way of life hinduism is a full fledged religion and has its own scriptures methodology and identity
8354241 as a liberal i dislike ruling people against their will
8354242 if you believe in democracy then giving kashmiris the right to self determination is the correct thing to do this is indias century we have the world to conquer and the means to do it kashmir is a 20th century problem we cannot let it drag us down and bleed us as we assume our rightful place in the world
8354243 i prefer to die in the streets shouting long live free kashmir than in an isolated confinement after being tortured by the indian army
8354244 but it is in kashmir that indians are the best shooters
8354245 beauty of the valley which nobody questions though some in india have nonetheless begun to ask themselves if the future of their great democracy is to keep four million kashmiris against their will it is a new tune
8354246 why has the government in new delhi kept silent and inactive for so long when the tension had already started mounting in july
8354247 they are volatile and timid they are good looking but deceitful
8354248 accepting bribes was considered by the officers as virtue oppressing the subjects was regarded as wisdom and the addiction to wine and women was reckoned as happiness
8354249 it is possible that the principal purpose of abdullahs visit was to make clear to us that there is a third alternative namely independence he made quite a long and impassioned statement on the subject he said in effect that whether kashmir went to pakistan or india the other dominion would always be against a solution kashmir is a rich country he did not want his people torn by dissension between pakistan and india it would be much better if kashmir were independent and could seek american and british aid for development of the country
8354250 it is not necessary that our state should become an appendage of either india or pakistan
8354251 we fought for our land and will continue to fight for our land till our last breath
8354252 among other dangerous loopholes some of which have widened since congress gave its conditional go ahead to the deal in december india is pointedly not taking on the obligations and practices of the official five unlike them it has refused to sign the test ban treaty unlike them it declines to end the production of fissile material uranium and plutonium for bombs
8354253 china unhappy at americas coddling of india is exploring more nuclear cooperation with pakistan which in turn threatens to match india should it step up weapons production or test again
8354254 areva the worlds largest maker of nuclear power stations and general electric are among four companies poised to share 14 billion of orders from india
8354255 in fact the purpose of the us to sign civilian nuclear energy cooperation with india is to enclose india into its global partners camp so as to balance the forces of asia
8354256 we have already seen strategic benefits from our improving relations with india indias votes at the iaea on the iran issue last september and this past february demonstrate that new delhi is able and willing to adjust its traditional foreign policies and play a constructive role on international issues
8354257 a platform of partnerships that will enable america to advance its interests and its values in this dynamic region for years to come
8354258 from washingtons perspective harmonising india pakistan relations makes the u s the predominant power in south asia it has serious implications for asian security as well as for the persian gulf and central asia the fallout on afghanistan can only be helpful the u s diplomacy will become optimal it makes a fine legacy
8354259 once i felt proud to be a leftist a marxist today the same thought directs me to kick my own ass
8354260 we were in nandigram right from the beginning we are in nandigram and we will continue to remain in nandigram
8354261 many people are trying to call the nandigram peoples struggle simply as another mass movement they also believe that the movement continued for eleven long months entirely unarmed but the real truth is the resistance sustained only because of the presence of the armed militia
8354262 at the beginning people of nandigram followed the trinamul leadership of bhumi ucched protirodh committee but from july onwards they continued their struggle under our leadership and plan
8354263 our relationship with the us has never been in such a good shape
8354264 some us websites in the us had put the text up even before the mea site
8354265 the draft agreement could not be circulated to a third party
8354266 mr karat in most of the meetings of the upa left committee said he had no interest in the draft agreement
8354267 the congress leadership has violated the understanding arrived at with the left parties in november 2007 wherein the outcome of the talks with the secretariat of the iaea was to be presented to the upa left committee on the nuclear deal
8354268 the text of the safeguards agreement was not given to the committee to study so there can be no findings of the committee on the basis of which the government can proceed further
8354269 at least put one version of lies and not different lies
8354270 india may take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies
8354271 the facility is no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of safeguards
8354272 everyone was overcome with emotion not just the cubans che was such a mythic figure
8354273 we cannot be indifferent to what happens anywhere in the world for a victory by any country over imperialism is our victory just as any countrys defeat is a defeat for all of us the practice of proletarian internationalism is not only a duty for the peoples struggling for a better future it is an inescapable necessity if the imperialist enemy american or any other develops its attack against the underdeveloped peoples and the socialist countries simple logic determines the necessity of an alliance between the underdeveloped peoples and the socialist countries if there were no other uniting factor the common enemy should be it
8354274 in a world of ferocious competition and consumerism some element of humanity is still looking for a hero with values
8354275 if we want to say how we want the men of future generations to be we should say let them be like che if we want a model of a man a model of a man who does not belong to his time a model of a man who belongs to future times from the heart i say that the model without a single blemish in its conduct without a single blemish in its attitude without a single blemish in its actions that model is che if we want to know how we want our children to be we should say with all our mind and heart we want them to be like che
8354276 temporary camps will be set up on a 4 km stretch surrounding the automobile plant if any attempt is made to prevent our peaceful agitation there will be statewide protests and the government will have to face the consequences
8354277 return 400 acres of land forcibly acquired from unwilling poor farmers
8354278 many workers have left the small car project site we will drive away the rest
8354279 ultimately the people of bengal have to decide whether they want industrialisation
8354280 the additional 400 acres are acquired for building shopping malls and other things
8354281 analysts have convincingly shown that this additional power will come at a much higher cost per unit of electricity compared to conventional coal or hydro power which india can generate without foreign imports
8354282 once the deal is in place it is also clear that indias commercial nuclear interactions with the us as well as with any other country will be firmly controlled from washington via the stipulations of the hyde act 2006 enforced through the stranglehold which the us retains on the nuclear suppliers group
8354283 the real issue facing india therefore is whether or not we want this mythical extra energy security through this deal paying almost thrice the unit capital cost of conventional power plants with the additional burden of subjugating
8354284 the indians will laud the relationship as a success if they obtain the technology that they want from the united states
8354285 therefore after signing the nuclear deal us will start pursuing and pressurizing for military contracts india will one day find itself entwined with this strategic and commercial designs of the us and after falling into their grip will become a lucrative client and loyal satellite of the us
8354286 what it tells us of the u s grand strategy and that behind whatever else is going on here the u s is preparing for a grand conflict with china and constructing an anti china coalition in that scenario india is even more valuable as a nuclear power rather than as a non nuclear country

8354294 better does not necessarily mean more entertaining if you want entertainment you play twenty20 cricket
8354295 that has to be the judgment these changes have been made with a view to entertainment not to improving rugby
8354296 if the game is played well and refereed well there is nothing wrong with it
8354297 john oneill australian rugby union chief executive is the greatest supporter of the changes and the pressure on rugby in australia is to win fans
8354298 theyre competing directly against aussie rules rugby league and football
8354299 all three are simple motion games where the ball is always in play to compete the super 14 has become a quick tap motion game
8354300 the ball is in play a lot but that doesnt create a better game it creates entertainment to the detriment of rugby
8354301 now theres test match cricket and twenty20 cricket but we need to keep test match rugby around the world most people want to watch test rugby
8354302 there are pockets around the world who want to see twenty20 cricket so lets make twenty12 rugby we could have 12 players 20 minutes each way with no scrums or line outs
8354303 as the game becomes more professional another form of the game could develop sevens hasnt been a success as entertainment
8354304 in our pre season games the laws have not made a massive amount of difference
8354305 but what has been crucial is that the referees have been concentrating on them and not on other aspects of the game which make it function
8354306 if you have done your homework on them then hopefully you will have your game plan in place and you will have a good understanding as to what they have to offer
8354307 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8354308 ensure compatibility with every third party technology in the marketplace
8354309 technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilize
8354310 we the asa considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8354475 some of the best students in the nation know that usf is the place to find top quality academics and exciting campus life
8354476 the class of 2012 is incredibly prepared for the challenges they will face at one of the nations leading research universities
8354477 they will continue contributing to our rising reputation as those before them have done so ably
8354478 one cant help but notice usfs growing strengths in so many areas without taking into account how much we have gained in such a short period of time
8354479 our peers around the nation are taking notice and this is very gratifying to our outstanding faculty and staff
8354480 in the spring of 2008 the magazine asked top academics as part of the regular u s news peer assessment survey to name the schools that they think are up and coming institutions college presidents provosts and admissions deans were asked to nominate up to 10 colleges in their u s news americas best colleges ranking category that are making improvements in academics faculty students campus life diversity and facilities these schools are worth watching because they are making promising and innovative changes this item on the peer survey enabled college officials to pick schools within their ranking category that are rapidly evolving in ways that the public should be aware of and that are not always quickly noticeable in a colleges year to year rankings
8354481 i have written to irish rail and asked them to consider moving the large vehicle warning sign at the coolmine level crossing the signs are mounted in such a way as to block a significant part of the footpath and create an obstruction to pedestrians the footpath is already very narrow at this particular point and i have seen parents with buggies forced out onto the road i can only imagine it is difficult for wheelchair users to negotiate passing them also
8354482 i think everyone who uses coolmine station welcomed the construction by irish rail of the pedestrian bridge crossing the canal however the positioning of these signs remains an obstacle to those crossing the tracks at what is a very busy crossing both with pedestrians and cars at peak time
8354483 while i understand that there is a legal obligation to have a warning sign i have asked irish rail to examine the site and see if the signs could be moved to a safer and more appropriate location indeed in their current location drivers of large vehicles would have almost crossed the tracks by the time they could see the signs so from the point of view of irish rails legal obligations its probably a good idea to move the signs also
8354484 the chief end of man is to glorify god and to fully enjoy him forever

8354494 we were told not to keep anything in the car so we didnt

8354498 but as we watched the sears tower fade out of our rearview mirror this morning we know a huge part of our lives are somewhere in chicago
8354499 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8354500 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8354501 okay i get where shes coming from it makes sense
8354502 we dont make mistakes here we just have happy accidents
8354503 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8354504 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8354505 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8354506 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8354507 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8354510 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other

8354515 john mccain is distorting barack obamas words to cover up for the fact that its the failed bush mccain approach to foreign policy and the bush mccain war in iraq that that have strengthened iran and endangered israel while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook

8354545 how can we expect our kids to compete on an equal playing field with kids at suburban schools
8354546 im going to say open these doors and put my kid on equal footing
8354547 but the fact that the amount of money spent on education is determined by where you live is fundamentally unfair
8354548 if we had a little bit of the resources of the districts five miles from us we could close the gap that much quicker
8354549 by most measures the performance of u s students has remained stubbornly flat in the face of resource or policy adjustments
8354550 telling them to go to another district and enroll sends the message that your teachers arent as good as those in the suburbs
8354551 i bring the same level of competence to my classroom as any other teacher
8354552 participants in 401 k and 403 b are they different

8354556 based on a true story the express follows the extraordinary life of college football hero ernie davis rob brown the first african american to win the heisman trophy his fight for equality and respect forever changed the face of american sports and his story continues to inspire new generations raised in poverty in pennsylvania coal mining country davis hurdled social and economic obstacles to become one of the greatest running backs in college football history under the guidance of legendary syracuse coach ben schwartzwalder dennis quaid he became a hero who superseded jim browns achievements and set records that stand to this day as the growing civil rights movement divided the country in the 60s davis became a symbol for achievement that transcended race refusing to flinch from others prejudices he achieved all his goals until he faced a challenge that would make most men crumble he joined the ranks of black pioneers by teaching a generation tolerance inspiring a movement that smashed barriers on and off the field
8354557 i know that our c train operator was injured and taken to hospital i dont know what his condition is at this stage
8354558 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terrorism
8354559 momin khawaja was prepared to provide and metaphorically pull the trigger of a very powerful weapon
8354560 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8354561 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8354562 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8354563 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8354564 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight
8354565 it defies reason to me that all of this money can be coming into the market with no effect
8354566 like this is all kind of after the fact moving around and not doing something to the underlying price of the thing thats being examined

8354570 if youre one of these people who says theyre not going to vote for anyone for president because their candidate didnt get chosen then you shouldnt be here i have nothing but respect for independents but this is the
8354571 pat cannady has discovered something being a delegate from john mccains home state of arizona has its advantages
8354572 unity said cannady has to be the number one takeaway from this convention and she doesnt feel introducing senator clintons name into nomination will help
8354573 some of the clinton supporters are just plain confused some had thrown their support behind obama after clinton dropped out of the race but since they were originally selected as clinton delegates they really are torn about that roll call
8354574 a retiree with a background in early childhood education lifelong democrat pat canady is excited to be attending her first convention
8354575 ive been involved in politics my whole life my first campaign involvement was as a kennedy kid in high school but this is the first presidential campaign where i knew upfront right from the start who i was going to support ive been supporting obama since the day he declared
8354576 it takes a long time to change the course of the ship of state
8354577 think of me as your senator and then work like the dickens to elect a better one
8354578 stand still stand still let the forest find you no two trees alike to raven no two bushes alike to wren stand still
8354579 look i know you dont think youll ever need this thing i just dont want you out there as a woman lost some time its just too dangerous
8354580 im being totally serious i love this opera the more i hear it the more i love it part of it is that its a contemporary approach to opera which is different from the classics the more i see older operas the more i like this one
8354581 its great because you do have many things in common that are unique because of canada that are non american that are not anywhere else
8354582 its an understanding its a very different temperament that we have in canada and its very congenial i spend a lot of time explaining to americans well i used to i dont do it so much anymore why we are in fact quite different
8354583 we didnt have a civil war we didnt have a revolution we didnt have slavery people dont own guns and those are really serious cultural differences in the evolution of our countries which have led to very different attitudes to health to the social net the idea that you take care of other people and you dont just look out for yourself
8354584 i can sense the differences when i go back and forth
8354585 going to vancouver you kind of find your grounding again
8354586 when we did the fly in the 80s i was heavily into italian opera the release of the fly in italy was called la mosca and i saw it in florence and i thought this should be staged as an opera then i started thinking about the characters and dreaming about it so the idea was really hatched around the time of the film in the 80s and its been a wonderful journey ive enjoyed every part of it bringing together different artists from different mediums was wonderful
8354587 when you have mastered numbers you will in fact no longer be reading numbers any more than you read words when reading books you will be reading meanings

8354591 no talent no rhythm no guts were the kind of band that america wants
8354592 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
8354593 because at the end of the day let me tell you what i m good at im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science
8354594 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8354595 that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8354596 democrats know how to do it as i recall we did it again with president clinton and the democrats and we can do it again with president obama and the democrats
8354597 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8354598 the presumption of innocence has been derogated and reduced to a joke while my rights have been irrevocably prejudiced
8354599 he will initially try the same tactics that milosevic and seselj tried to swamp the tribunal with motions to delay the start of the trial
8354600 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8354601 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8354602 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8354603 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8354604 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario

8354653 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
8354654 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
8354655 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous

8354660 i know lee is at the house i saw mallorys car was out front it was just on the news they were just live outside the house
8354661 can you get tonys number for me so i can call him
8354662 i can do that but i dont know what good its going to do you at this point
8354663 well id like to talk to him any way because i called to talk to my mother and it is a expletive waste
8354664 by the way i dont want any of you coming up here when i have my first hearing for bond and everything i mean dont even expletive waste your time coming up here
8354665 you know you are having a real tough year and making it real tough for anybody to want to try to even if it is giving
8354666 first you are asking me for tonys phone number so you can call him and then you immediately want to start pressing toward me and dont even worry about coming up here for all this stuff and trying to cut us out
8354667 you know that is pretty pointless im not going to put everyone else through the same stuff that youve been putting the police and everybody else for the last 24 hours and the stuff youve been putting mom through for the last four or five weeks im done with that so you can tell me whats going on kristina would love to talk to you because she thinks you will tell her whats going on frankly we are going to find out whatever is going on is going to be found out so why not do it now
8354668 there is absolutely nothing to find out not even what i told the detectives i have no clue where caylee is if i knew where caylee was do you think that any of this would be happening no
8354669 anyway you only have a couple of minutes with this so im not going to let you completely waste it
8354670 im glad everybody is at my house but ill have to call you later or ill have to call to get somebody to get your number do me a favor and get my brother back because i need tonys number
8354671 i absolutely know you are and i appreciate it and everything you are trying to do but id like to call tony hes not at my house is he
8354672 well can you do me a favor and get my brother back so i can get the number from him please
8354673 ok so why do you want to talk with tony
8354674 oh then why do you want to talk with him
8354675 because he is my boyfriend and i want to actually try and sit and talk to him because i didnt get a chance to talk to him earlier
8354676 because i got arrested on a expletive whim today and because they are blaming me for stuff that i would never do that i didnt do
8354677 i know that i just want to talk with tony and get a little bit of
8354678 casey you have to tell me if you know anything about caylee
8354679 if anything happened to caylee ill die you understand ill die
8354680 calling you guys was a waste a huge waste honey i love you you know id never let anything happen to my daughter if i knew where she was this would not be going on
8354681 then how come everyone is saying that you are lying
8354682 because nobody is expletive listening to anything that im saying
8354683 the media misconstrued everything that i said the expletive detectives pulled expletive expletive they got all of their information from me but at the same time they are twisting stuff they already said they are going to pin this on me if they dont find caylee theyve already said that they arrested me because they said
8354684 they said that the person you left caylee with doesnt exist
8354685 you know that whoever has caylee nobody is going to get away with it
8354686 i know nobody is going to get away with it but at the same time the only way they are going to find caylee is if they actually listen to what im saying and im trying to help them and they are not letting me help them
8354687 the best thing you can do baby is to listen to me
8354688 does she have caylee or did she transfer caylee to someone else
8354689 how come everyone is saying that you are not upset and that you are not crying and you show no caring of where caylee is at all
8354690 because im not here expletive crying every two seconds because i have to stay composed to talk to detectives to make other phone calls and do other things
8354691 i cant sit here and be crying every two seconds like i want to i cant
8354692 ok casey dont yell at me im on your side
8354693 they just want caylee back that is all they are worried about right now is getting caylee back

8354711 again ive only been in jail since about 8 30 tonight i was with them all day i know that i was with officers pretty much since 9 p m last night up until this evening when i came up here
8354712 but you are telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth
8354713 yes that is the truth that is the absolute truth
8354714 if this is true why did my father not know about this and his father and grandfather and his father
8354715 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness because that which is know about god is evident within them for god made it evident within them for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse
8354716 the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
8354717 for they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever

8354754 i dont advocate violence but its something we have to explore
8354755 in a way genevieve is the king and the narrator is scheherazade
8354756 the narrator is reluctant he doesnt want to be there but he doesnt want to go back to the hospital hes a good storyteller and stories can save your life sometimes
8354757 i wonder sometimes if my story is more interesting than my writing
8354758 i did surpass many obstacles it makes a great story of course but at some point i realized many profiles were more context than content i think i can now claim to be known as a writer of literature first and foremost
8354759 because its the closest thing to the earth its the closest thing to the underground somehow it enters peoples places with ease its functional and metaphoric at the same time
8354760 i dont advocate violence but its something we have to explore
8354761 its part of our society but just exploring violence doesnt mean im subscribing to it description is not prescription
8354762 theres a lot of literature dealing with non violence but this non violence is always advocated by people who are victims you never ask non violence from people in power i find it ironic
8354763 theres this collision of civilizations that live side by side and i cant believe religion is coming back
8354764 if anything this book is about secularism its a clear attack on organized religion maybe because i lived through a religious war but i saw how religion can be destructive and how irrational it can make people having said that im not on a mission in my writing but these are my own beliefs

8354861 se postr a sus pies ador ndolo mas pedro lo levant diciendo lev ntate pues yo mismo tambi n soy hombre
8354862 respondiendo pedro y los ap stoles dijeron es necesario obedecer a dios antes que a los hombres
8354863 la palabra de dios debe ser reconocida sobre toda otra legislaci n humana
8354864 a los ancianos que est n entre ustedes yo que soy anciano como ellos testigo de los sufrimientos de cristo y part cipe con ellos de la gloria que se ha de revelar les ruego esto cuiden como pastores el reba o de dios que est a su cargo no por obligaci n ni por ambici n de dinero sino con af n de servir como dios quiere
8354865 esta revela o de fraqueza da parte daqueles que haviam sido respeitados e amados como dirigentes produziu dolorosa impress o na mente dos crentes gentios a igreja foi amea ada de divis o mas paulo que viu a subversiva influ ncia do erro praticado para com a igreja pela duplicidade de atitude da parte de pedro reprovou o abertamente por dissimular assim seus verdadeiros sentimentos
8354866 quando por m pedro veio a antioquia enfrentei o face a face por sua atitude conden vel
8354867 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8354868 esta manifestaci n de debilidad de parte de aquellos que hab an sido respetados y amados como dirigentes hizo la m s penosa impresi n en la mente de los creyentes gentiles la iglesia estaba amenazada por un cisma pero pablo que vio la subversiva influencia del mal hecho a la iglesia por el doble papel desempe ado por pedro le reprendi abiertamente por disimular as sus verdaderos sentimientos
8354869 pues bien cuando pedro fue a antioquia le ech en cara su comportamiento condenable
8354870 ao verem a intrepidez de pedro e jo o sabendo que eram homens iletrados e incultos admiraram se e reconheceram que haviam eles estado com jesus
8354871 vendo a coragem de pedro e de jo o e percebendo que eram homens comuns e sem instru o ficaram admirados e reconheceram que eles haviam estado com jesus
8354872 n o h salva o em nenhum outro pois debaixo do c u n o h nenhum outro nome dado aos homens pelo qual devamos ser salvos
8354873 tendo eles orado tremeu o lugar onde estavam reunidos todos ficaram cheios do esp rito santo e com intrepidez anunciavam a palavra de deus da multid o dos que creram era um o cora o e a alma ningu m considerava exclusivamente sua nem uma das coisas que possu a
8354874 com grande poder os ap stolos davam testemunho da ressurrei o do senhor jesus e em todos eles havia abundante gra a
8354875 pero de los que ten an reputaci n de ser algo lo que hayan sido en otro tiempo nada me importa dios no hace acepci n de personas a m pues los de reputaci n nada nuevo me comunicaron
8354876 como cristo es cabeza de la iglesia la cual es su cuerpo y l es su salvador
8354877 vengan cantemos con j bilo al se or aclamemos a la roca de nuestra salvaci n
8354878 cuando vi sin embargo que no proced a correctamente seg n la verdad del evangelio le dije a cefas en la presencia de todos si siendo t jud o vives como los gentil y no como jud o por qu obligas a los gentiles a vivir como jud os
8354879 pies los que en cristo fueron bautizados de cristo est n revestidos no hay jud o ni griego esclavo ni libre hombre ni mujer pues todos son uno en cristo jes s
8354880 minha ora o n o apenas por eles rogo tamb m por aqueles que crer o em mim por meio da mensagem deles para que todos sejam um pai como tu est s em mim e eu em ti
8354881 os que criam mantinham se unidos e tinham tudo em comum
8354882 os disc pulos de cristo tinham profundo senso da pr pria inefici ncia e com humilha o e ora o uniam sua fraqueza a sua for a sua ignor ncia a sua sabedoria sua indignidade a sua justi a e sua pobreza a sua inesgot vel riqueza assim fortalecidos e equipados n o hesitaram em avan ar a servi o do mestre
8354883 os disc pulos continuavam cheios de alegria e do esp rito santo
8354884 entonces viendo el denuedo de pedro y de juan y sabiendo que eran hombres sin letras y del vulgo se maravillaban y les reconoc an que hab an estado con jes s
8354885 vengan s ganme les dijo jes s y los har pescadores de hombres
8354886 los gobernantes al ver la osad a con que hablaban pedro y juan y al darse cuenta de que eran gente sin estudios ni preparaci n quedaron asombrados y reconocieron que hab an estado con jes s
8354887 de hecho en ning n otro hay salvaci n porque no hay bajo el cielo otro nombre dado a los hombres mediante el cual podamos ser salvos
8354888 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8354889 respondeu lhes pedro arrependei vos e cada um v s seja batizado em nome de jesus cristo para remiss o dos vossos pecados e recebereis o dom do esp rito santo
8354890 e n o h salva o em nenhum outro porque abaixo do c u n o existe nenhum outro nome dado entre os homens pelo qual importa que sejamos salvos
8354891 a quem se dirigiu dizendo v s bem sabeis que proibido a um judeu ajuntar se ou mesmo aproximar se a algu m de outra ra a mas deus me demonstrou que a nenhum homem considerasse comum ou imundo
8354892 j bastante sem d vida ter feito no passado a vontade dos gentios vivendo na devassid o nas concupisc ncias na embriaguez nas orgias bebedices e idolatrias infames
8354893 ouvindo isso n o apresentaram mais obje es e louvaram a deus dizendo ent o deus concedeu arrependimento para a vida at mesmo aos gentios
8354894 voc s por m s o gera o eleita sacerd cio real na o santa povo exclusivo de deus para anunciar as grandezas daquele que os chamou das trevas para a sua maravilhosa luz
8354895 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8354896 quando por m vi que n o procediam corretamente segundo a verdade do evangelho disse a cefas na presen a de todos se sendo tu judeu vives como gentio e n o como judeu por que obrigas os gentios a viverem como judeus
8354897 pois os que em cristo foram batizados de cristo se revestiram n o h judeu nem grego escravo nem livre homem nem mulher pois todos s o um em cristo jesus
8354898 o que na realidade eles fossem n o me interessa deus n o faz acep o de pessoas de qualquer forma os not veis nada me acrescentaram
8354899 como tamb m cristo o cabe a da igreja que o seu corpo do qual ele o salvador
8354900 tamb m eu te digo que tu s pedro e sobre esta pedra edificarei a minha igreja e as portas do inferno n o prevalecer o contra ela
8354901 pois tamb m eu te digo que tu s pedro e sobre esta pedra edificarei a minha igreja e as portas do inferno n o prevalecer o contra ela
8354902 assim diz o senhor jeov eis que eu assentei em si o uma pedra uma pedra j provada pedra preciosa de esquina que est bem firme e fundada
8354903 se que j provastes que o senhor benigno e chegando vos para ele pedra viva reprovada na verdade pelos homens mas para com deus eleita e preciosa v s tamb m como pedras vivas sois edificados casa espiritual
8354904 por estar abatido o meu cora o leva me para a rocha que mais alta do que eu
8354905 pedro les dijo arrepentios y baut cese cada uno de vosotros en el nombre de jesucristo para perd n de los pecados y recibir is el don del esp ritu santo
8354906 y les dijo vosotros sab is cu n abominable es para un var n jud o juntarse o acercarse a un extranjero pero a m me ha mostrado dios que a ning n hombre llame com n o inmundo
8354907 baste ya el tiempo pasado para haber hecho lo que agrada a los gentiles andando en lascivias concupiscencias embriagueces org as disipaci n y abominables idolatr as
8354908 entonces o das estas cosas callaron y glorificaron a dios diciendo de manera que tambi n a los gentiles ha dado dios arrepentimiento para vida
8354909 mas vosotros sois linaje escogido real sacerdocio naci n santa pueblo adquirido por dios para que anunci is las virtudes de aquel que os llam de las tinieblas a su luz admirable
8354910 saibam os senhores e todo o povo de israel que por meio do nome de jesus cristo o nazareno a quem os senhores crucificaram mas a quem deus ressuscitou dos mortos este homem est a curado diante dos senhores
8354911 camas e macas para que pelo menos a sombra de pedro se projetasse sobre alguns
8354912 a palavra de deus precisa ser reconhecida como estando acima de toda a legisla o humana um assim diz o senhor n o deve ser posto margem por um assim diz a igreja ou um assim diz o estado a coroa de cristo tem de ser erguida acima dos diademas de potentados terrestres
8354913 edificarei a minha igreja e as portas do inferno n o prevalecer o contra ela

8354918 one of the larger funding rounds weve seen in the solar energy marketplace
8354919 nanosolar has plenty of company in the photo voltaic and concentrating solar power start up space
8354920 companies such as heliovolt solfocus and suniva have all taken part in investment rounds exceeding 50 million
8354921 we have a short list of the industrys most experienced most scalable and most bankable customers
8354922 we dont announce names at this point we have many billions under contract
8354923 obviously starting up any advanced factory like these has its load of start up kinks to be worked through its a lot of work
8354924 at this time we are focused on product and customers and want to be known for making money not raising money
8354925 this financing was literally just a side effect of the industry partnerships we have established to implement solar utility power

8354928 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8354929 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8354930 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else then thats where we need to be
8354931 we believe it to be one of the largest va overpayment or alleged fraud cases ever in this region
8354932 we believe and im putting this in the softest of terms that it could be a number that approaches at least 1 5 million
8354933 a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds hillary clinton reluctantly and persuasively making the case for obama the temple of obama reuters reports that
8354934 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8354935 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8354936 yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8354937 russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago
8354938 the georgian economy has continued functioning more or less as normal the financial system kept functioning the exchange rate has held up the consumers have kept consuming
8354939 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8354940 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8354941 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8354942 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8354943 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8354944 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8354945 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
8354946 i am very disappointed to have lost the game 3 0 because funnily enough i was pleased with the way we were playing for the first hour
8354947 even at 1 0 i thought we matched them but the second goal killed us
8354948 all the goals were soft and very poor on our behalf people werent switched on at crucial times and thats cost us in the end
8354949 it was a repeat of last season we were in the game with an hour gone and then they get a goal out of nothing burnley didnt have to work hard for their goals and im gutted for the fans because they were brilliant weve lost the game 3 0 and its gone now the main thing is to look ahead and concentrate on getting a positive result at colchester on saturday
8354950 lets home martin loves the cup competitions as much as the league because he has shown he is a natural goalscorer who will get his share of goals
8354951 personally i love the goals he is scoring because they are real strikers goals sometimes it can be a thankless task and you might fee isolated leading the line but for him to go and get two more goals on the night will give him a terrific lift
8354952 he is showing why we brought him to the football club and with the age he is at he is going to serve this club for years to come and theres no doubt he will score goals
8354953 we knew it was going to be a tricky tie because oldham have won all their games and you could see that confidence within them but i felt we fully merited the win on the night i think we started the game well and had a couple of opportunities to score
8354954 when the goal came it was real quality the passing and movement was wonderful and it was a great finish by chris mccann
8354955 no it was the culmination of seven years of national investment planning concentrated state power national mobilization and hard work
8354956 china has been preparing for the olympics weve been preparing for al qaeda theyve been building better stadiums subways airports roads and parks and weve been building better metal detectors armored humvees and pilotless drones

8354961 jewish dominated intellectual movements were a critical factor necessary condition for the triumph of the intellectual left in late twentieth century western societies
8354962 what has happened since world war ii is that the american sensibility has become part jewish perhaps as much jewish as it is anything else the literate american mind has come in some measure to think jewishly

8354966 this is a serious problem it kind of blew me away
8354967 i did this a couple of times but the scariest thing would be someone doing this with some scale
8354968 we cant seem to get rid of that question if we do nothing this will get steadily worse
8354969 there is an arms race here between people who trying to ask obscure questions about us and people who are trying to answer obscure questions about us
8354970 if you think about it 10 years ago this didnt seem like horrible idea to ask for someones personal information
8354971 you could say its probably unlikely that someone will know all of this information about me or spent the time necessary to gather it but now its really easy for someone whos never met you to know all this about you
8354972 in some cases its easier for an attacker with good data mining skills than the real person to answer these questions
8354973 its not so easy to match up a pet name from facebook with another database of login names and another database of social security numbers
8354974 it would be incredibly difficult to recover from something like that
8354975 you cant really change your mothers maiden name or these other things
8354976 oh but he says all the things we need to do to make this nation better
8354977 obama campaigns on reforming a broken political process yet he has always played politics by the rules as they exist not as he would like them to exist

8355240 these hard times are both as a band and as individuals
8355241 working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band
8355242 regardless of what happened jess and azaria are still very close mates and were planning to catch up in the us
8355243 it was a real cup game and they made it very physical
8355244 they played a lot on the fringe but to sustain that for 90 minutes is very difficult for any team in the world
8355245 i felt we could use that to our advantage in the second half but it was a very difficult game and all respect to twente they played very well
8355246 i believe they will make it very difficult for us again on wednesday they will try to defend well in every area of the pitch and try to catch us on the break
8355247 we know what a big game this is but then every game is a must win when you are at a club like liverpool
8355248 it was difficult when we played liege away and we certainly werent at our best that night but we know how important this game is because liverpool need to be in the champions league and im sure the lads will be right up for the game and looking forward to it
8355249 it was a tough game away they played well and made things difficult for us but luckily pepe reina saved us when he saved a penalty and now we have to look to make the most of that by taking advantage of the fact that this time its us who are at home

8355255 ha habido una oferta del real madrid por el jugador de m s de 40 millones de euros
8355256 la verdad es que durante el ltimo mes y medio han sucedido muchas cosas en mi cabeza y en mi entorno cosas que no hab a vivido antes y para las que no s si estaba preparado
8355257 he de agradecer al valencia el gesto que ha hecho por m y al club todo lo que me ha dado desde que llegu hace tres a os el presidente se ha esforzado por darme cari o en los momentos que m s lo necesitaba y yo espero seguir dando el m ximo rendimiento e incluso mejorarlo
8355258 la cl usula era de 150 millones de euros y nunca iba a mover un dedo para salir del valencia
8355259 si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu mi actual club no ha aceptado una oferta de mucho dinero y eso para m es un orgullo en definitiva no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir de mestalla
8355260 mi evoluci n como jugador puede ser igual aqu que en el real madrid de lo contrario nunca hubiese firmado mi renovaci n espero devolver el cari o que esta afici n me da en cada entrenamiento y en cada partido
8355261 conozco a cazorla y a iker bromas de esas solemos gastar a diario
8355262 estic molt content de estar a i hui amunt valencia
8355263 el valencia y david villa van a seguir juntos muchos a os para m es un honor anunciar que el mejor delantero de europa va a seguir en nuestro equipo
8355264 por encima de las palabras aqu est n los hechos estamos elaborando un proyecto deportivo con paso firme con rigor y con los pilares de la credibilidad y la ambici n ni siquiera hoy quiero acordarme de los que vaticinaron lo que hoy descartamos en el valencia hacen falta hombres con valor en el campo y respeto por la afici n como es david
8355265 es un mensaje claro y rotundo para el resto del mundo del futbol y algunos de sus dirigentes el valencia no se va a dejar intimidar por nadie con el valencia se va de frente y con las cartas encima de la mesa no aceptamos otra forma de actuar
8355266 a la afici n hemos de decirle que tenga tranquilidad que no nos den las gracias porque hacer grande al equipo es una exigencia que parte de nosotros mismos
8355267 creo que es as es la exigencia que tiene este club es muy grande y por eso se habla de crisis quiz s hemos dejado de hacer cosas pero tampoco se puede negar que hemos estado al nivel del torneo pasado pero tampoco estamos en una crisis como se quiere hacer ver y obviamente son detalles los que nos faltan para llegar a d nde queremos
8355268 m s bien se les extra a porque son amigos de todos nosotros y creo que las ausencias que se est n mencionando no deben influir sabemos que son buenos jugadores pero ya su tiempo ya pas ahora nos toca estar a otros dentro de la cancha y tratar de sacar adelante esto adelante no sirve de nada hablar de los que ya no est n
8355269 ya nos hace falta ganar un torneo internacional ya hemos estado cerca en algunas competiciones y ya nos hace falta
8355270 no est en buenas condiciones la cancha es para los dos y el que se adapte m s r pido a esa cancha ganar en chivas no estamos acostumbrados a poner excusas sino adaptarnos a cualquier circunstancia
8355271 el equipo emocionalmente se equilibra sabe autocriticarse sabe autoanalizar y sabe corregirse s nos entristeci mucho nos doli mucho pero ya le dimos vuelta a la p gina hay que darle vuelta a la p gina hay que salir delante de esto y ya pensaremos en morelia luego de que enfrentemos a aragua

8355293 its always like this especially now its worse because before we had the garbage container just for garbage what happened now that theres no more garbage container is that all the garbage gets put beside the recycling container

8355295 the large recycling bin in the mall parking lot is no longer as vital as it once was
8355296 i said here are the pros and here are the cons
8355297 the cons to me outweigh the pros but youve got to sit down and sleep on it and look over the aegean sea and think about it one thing i love about him is that when he goes out to perform he wants to perform to the ultimate level at this point i dont know if he was ready in his heart to do that
8355298 i told him to think about the reality that in two months how are you going to feel everything is worn off and now youre in the battle again do you really want that when youve been working on your other career at that point we came to the conclusion that it didnt make a lot of sense he loves the giants and he loves the fans but it just wasnt the right thing

8355333 the american proposition makes a particular claim upon the reflective attention of the catholic in the matter of the pluralist society
8355334 by pluralism here i mean the coexistence within the one political community of groups who hold divergent and incompatible views with regard to religious questions those ultimate questions that concern the nature and destiny of man within a universe that stands under the reign of god pluralism therefore implies disagreement and dissension within the community but it also implies a community within which there must be agreement and consensus there is no small political problem here

8355344 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
8355345 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds
8355346 i made it very clear to sen mccain when i spoke to him yesterday and i made it very clear to his people that i am honored to be asked to speak at the convention and that i would be honored to do anything to help him win the presidency but that the state of california and the budget is the most important thing
8355347 so that if i dont have a budget i cannot speak at the convention
8355348 we recognize his responsibilities in california and well certainly work with him regarding scheduling should that issue arise

8355358 well i really love all of the winter games but im assuming were sticking to summer and id have to say ive become a little addicted to the gymnatics ive been rooting for shawn johnson shes so adorable
8355359 yes and then if he plays the injury card for half the season we can trade him for someone who will be a stronger contributor or to open up some cap space to sign one or two really strong players next summer but it sounds like risebrough is willing to offer quite a bit closer to 9m and im not so sure that hes worth it its a tough deal for the wild because a big name can be a big draw for retaining sths but at the same time they have to think about how much money theyre investing in one player and how much hes actually contributing to the team on a consistent basis and look at the other possibilities on how that can be spent

8355407 now that hillary is not there i hope the whole city gets behind obama and biden i think they will
8355408 an obama biden ticket will not cure what ails them in pennsylvania
8355409 you couldnt dare him to do anything because the problem was hed do it
8355410 his dna is still up in that alley because i never saw anybody bleed as much as him
8355411 argue local politics state politics world events truman against macarthur
8355412 i know about delaware that its solid republican at the time i looked at him
8355413 he looked at me and said i can talk now
8355414 while rock financial is not renewing the presenting sponsorship we remain a local pistons sponsor
8355415 some clinton supporters are trying to honor all the great work she did and all of her accomplishments
8355416 the first ballot is needed to show the progress women have made
8355417 i want everyone to know how far women have come in the political process
8355418 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8355419 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8355420 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8355421 i think in the end all democrats have to make a decision on what they want in the next four years
8355422 four more years of george bush or four more years of change
8355423 i do not want more four more years of bushs failed policies when it comes to this general election its time to do what hillary asked us to do last night
8355424 at the end it will be a unanimous decision to endorse obama
8355425 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8355426 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8355427 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8355428 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word
8355429 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8355430 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer

8355439 mr rubin expressed his view to the committee that at this stage in his career and in these circumstances retention compensation was not necessary for him in this cycle and that such grants were better awarded to others at different stages in their careers at citi the committee considered mr rubins request and did not award mr rubin retention compensation in january 2008

8355444 tenho muita admira o pelo trabalho do cuca que foi um grande jogador e vem fazendo um grande trabalho como t cnico
8355445 but the site will look more like a blog instead of a website
8355446 it had been bolted in forever and for whatever reason a lot of bass being played at times loosening the speaker or whatever it came out and hit me in the head
8355447 they wanted it to heal instead of busting open because it kept busting open
8355448 theyll both play and they have both proven they can win at this level
8355449 i feel were blessed we have two guys who can start
8355450 i want to keep each of them fresh throughout game and season they both deserve to play
8355451 a lot of it is getting back to fundamentals and having fun with it
8355452 a mike linebacker who is worried and anxious and mambi pambi isnt going to make plays a mike linebacker has to be an emotional leader of the defense and have fun thats what its going to take and its something im going to focus on i hate the word responsibility to make tackles i look at it as an opportunity
8355453 that person is a key to what we do defensively he makes a lot of calls directing things making plays can plug the inside cover the deep middle go to the flats play man to man and blitz
8355454 knees holding up good and my mental game is better its ever been
8355455 my understanding of things and awareness are better than ever its exciting for me
8355456 to make sure im as light on my feet as possible
8355457 then you dont have to think about fundamentals when you play
8355458 john is the most experienced and most knowledgeable player in the entire defense
8355459 people like to make a lot out of competition like its the nfl
8355460 the linebacker corps eats together hangs out together yeah we compete but its more than that we want each other to do as well as a group as we can do its more like family atmosphere than competitive
8355461 and i dont think people know how much of our energy and efforts are built toward getting young guys the foundation to really learn this defense and be as good as they can be it is a huge emphasis
8355462 im just trying to lead my team and be a good leader
8355463 i need to be the leading tackler in the pac 10 i need to find a way you need to have goals to accomplish them
8355464 we have been monitoring traffic for a long time and trends dont just happen for no reason in the past six months congestion has eased quite significantly the credit crunch is clearly the reason for that
8355465 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at slower and more economical speeds
8355466 part of the reason for these decreases is simply that there are fewer cars on the road as the price of fuel is making it too expensive for people to drive
8355467 peoples budgets are being squeezed and what is happening is that they are changing their driving habits while they are not necessarily getting rid of their cars they arent driving as often or they are perhaps car sharing to save money
8355468 the figures show that congestion has steadily continued to ease over the past six months it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next year or so because the credit crunch looks like its going to continue
8355469 it is true that people appear to be aware of what is known as eco driving they realise that if they drive slower they will be able to make a tank of fuel go that bit further its quite sensible when you consider most people will be paying upwards of 60 for a tank of fuel
8355470 it does not surprise me in the least to hear that the price of fuel and the countrys economic situation is driving people off the road i think that what is happening is that people are continuing to make necessary journeys but they are cutting down on social driving

8355501 the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8355502 dont panic we have nothing to fear from an aging society
8355503 there would be only two persons of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
8355504 one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalization
8355505 the consequences of the aging population poses a greater threat to the national economy than climate change
8355506 its not as sexy a subject as climate change so this subject gets shoved off into the corner but its economic consequences are enormous and were calling on the government and the opposition to give the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt
8355507 i am so tired of the laziness of reporters who constantly trot out the common wisdom
8355508 like it or not the chinese solution to population control is no longer to be dismissed by the rest of the world
8355509 i think we can all agree that theres a real dearth of trashy fashion lines by c list stars thank god tara reid is filling the void with mantra
8355510 the mayor showed us pictures of some of the billboards with a projector and told us to replace them
8355511 as for us we will not charge clients anything but incur all the expenses ourselves because they will be incurring expenses while redesigning the advertisements
8355512 we will have to change whatever the ycdc finds unacceptable
8355513 they have both promised to look into the sufferings of the burmese people and find a solution to the crisis but till date there is no solid evidence that the promise has been kept or put into practice
8355514 i believe that she aung san suu kyi is on hunger strike i think it is the right time to remind them un and asean general secretaries that they must abide to their promise
8355515 we want a more serious action perhaps the un secretary general should appoint somebody else
8355516 i think it is about time that we find someone who is more capable
8355517 the secretary general should also look into the reasons as to why she is refusing her food supply
8355518 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table

8355551 the lack of progress was again explained to a large extent by the lack of progress in cutting weight in 2007 cars again became 10 kg heavier heavier cars use more fuel
8355552 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2
8355553 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
8355554 it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese suzuki mazda and nissan
8355555 all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts

8355587 nasa has confirmed that laptops carried to the iss in july were infected with a virus known as gammima
8355588 if you look at how arizona did in that area as compared to the nation and our region we actually did slightly better than average
8355589 its one quarterly report and were going to have two more for the rest of this year
8355590 so banks are looking at this and were monitoring it the same way as consumers are but its like everything the economys going to bounce back and bank earnings will as well
8355591 that means there are 8 300 banks that are not on the troubled bank list
8355592 just because a bank ends up on the troubled banks list does not mean it will fail
8355593 its really important to keep that in perspective in 1991 there were 1 430 banks on the troubled banks list

8355618 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8355619 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8355620 the reason he hasnt won is just because we havent had our cars fast enough but hes been close
8355621 he should have won two or three times this year maybe he can be a contender for a championship and have the best part of his year after the chase starts
8355622 it was a long green run day and i ran third the rest of the day
8355623 but a lap down third and every time the caution would come out the leaders were passing lapped cars again and i never got the lucky dog
8355624 i finished 20th and we ended up losing the championship by 35 points all we needed was a top 10 there and i had the championship won
8355625 thats kind of sore i guess but hopefully it wont happen this year if we get in
8355626 youve got to put yourself in that position to be able to win a race
8355627 youre not going to win from running 20th youre going to be in position running in the top five

8355746 its not really the media so much as it is sort of this political class of people who just go around causing trouble all the time
8355747 for instance it is spread all over the internet right now that my staff member lori klausutis who died tragically a month ago was killed by me i could list a thousand conspiracy theories against me that i rig elections that i have a drug running outfit with the cia that im a murderer that i have 15 illegitimate children
8355748 a p 2 team of three operatives from central intelligence suffocated her in scarboroughs florida district office recently after his divorce
8355749 fort walton beach fl lori klausutis a 28 year old office worker for rep joe scarborough r fl was found dead in the congressmans district office police said preliminary findings from the medical examiners office showed no foul play or any outward indication of suicide
8355750 my staff and family are greatly saddened by the loss of lori klausutis i know lori will be missed by the thousands of citizens who regularly contact my office to seek assistance with a variety of problems may god grant loris family the grace comfort and hope that will get them through this difficult time
8355751 she had a past medical history that was significant but it remains to be seen whether that played a role in her death

8355757 1 9 11 report is nothing more than obstruction of justice and a continuous cover up by the bush administration 2 9 11 commissioners were all hand picked by mr bush to obstruct justice and maintain a cover up of the facts and the evidence 3 the bush crime family was behind the attack on america
8355758 4 lets talk about able danger the scripted 9 11 attack on america the oklahoma city bombing with direct ties to the philippines and wachovia bank also known as project bojinka and then lets connect the dots oklahoma city 9 11 amp able danger scarborough cut off marianis mike took the camera off her and never allowed her to complete her statements
8355759 it is joes privilege as host to cut me off but he did it before hearing the rest of the facts how can americans find the common sense and truth when im not allowed to speak out on what i know and believe it to be
8355760 able danger was the secretive bucket shop operation in brooklyn new york where alleged terrorist mohamed atta a known mossad defense intelligence operative had direct ties to the bush clinton crime families
8355761 the bucket shop was known as a cash cow linked to maurice hank greenberg former ceo of aig insurance and the greenburg traurig law firm mossad lobbyists and paymaster jack abramoff were partners with white house linked money launderers leonard amp elaine millman who owned silverado savings where neil bush was a director of the failed savings amp loan millman controlled citi group citi bank before his death two years ago and was a direct partner in re insurance and securities fraud with greenberg and meyer blinder also linked to a failed 1990 91 penny stock collapse during a federal investigation involving billions in securities fraud in denver colorado
8355762 new york attorney general elliott spitzer filed a rico suit against greenberg instead of putting him in jail in 2005 after whistleblowers stew webb and tom heneghan provided evidence to spitzer who then covered it up but greenberg had to resign as ceo of aig to take the heat off of the connections to greenberg traurig
8355763 there is substantial evidence that the greenberg traurig firm is connected to the challenge over control of my dead husbands estate in order to silence my 9 11 rico suit against the bush crime family several stories of which are found at tomflocco com
8355764 maurice hank greenberg controlled through greenberg traurig a foundation known as the waymark group which was set up to finance the oklahoma city bombing and the 9 11 attack on america silverado savings and loan owner leonard millman laundered narcotics money into the waymark group and the narcotics were brought into mena arkansas a part of iran contra which involved george h w bush fox news host oliver north and bill and hillary clinton
8355765 jack abramoff had direct ties to mohamed atta and florida casinos one casino owner linked to the group was murdered abramoff was laundering money through the casinos and mohammad atta was seen gambling at the florida casinos
8355766 the information documents that mohamed atta was a defense intelligence mossad agent were taken out of the national security archives by former clinton national security advisor sandy burger with current secretary of state condoleezza rices permission to steal the evidence
8355767 sandy berger bill clintons former nsa director took the able danger document evidence out of the national archives and literally ate some of the documents while stuffing some of the other documents in his underwear and socks burger was fined a few months ago and never sent to prison but u s intelligence agents have concrete evidence of bergers actions but he still got away with selling out america
8355768 president bush ordered the washington dc missile defense system to stand down in late july 2001 bush also signed an executive order that told the fbi to back of their investigations of muslims the reason mr bush told the fbi to allow the brooklyn new york bucket shop cell to operate as an active entity and not be apprehended was so the cell could carry out the planned 9 11 2001 attack on america
8355769 fbi whistleblower sibel edmonds who recently lost her certiorari appeal before the united states supreme court after having been ordered gagged by three republican appeals court judges to help obstruct justice intercepted the turkish american council communications of defense intelligence rogue agent gary best and others who were involved in the 9 11 attacks best was an iran contra shadow government player now in french custody for trying to blow up the french satellite launch pad in french guyanna
8355770 other us intelligence agents also intercepted the turkish american council communications when george h w bush discussed the 9 11 attack on america george h w bush and richard cheney were 400 feet below ground in the white house situation room controlling the justice department tripod ii brooklyn new york bucket shop operation attacking america on 9 11 2001 this while george w bush was reading a goat story in a florida classroom far away from the action and why did he select a story about a goat

8355773 whistleblowers schwartz heneghan and webb provided evidence to new york attorney general elliot spitzer who continues the cover up which is obstruction of justice
8355774 lets look at the facts and evidence that friends of mine federal whistleblowers and us intelligence agents have and want to present before a federal grand jury and have filed in us district court for the district of colorado in denver case 95 y 107 filed aug 4 2004 by stewart webb
8355775 i was interviewed in may of 2002 by fox news network and their top spin doctor bill oreilly oreilly and joe scarborough are nothing more than little boys doing an adult job as spin doctors for the bushes and americans know this

8355781 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
8355782 basically i just never stopped choreographing for west valley since i left high school and i have really formed a relationship with the girls since many of them are on the team for three or four years
8355783 compared to my involvement with the shock it is pretty similar with the exception of game days when i am organizing the girls and what needs to get done
8355784 in high school when i first tried out the team wasnt great it was a lot of fun but things were more about entertainment which of course is important and less about developing skills and being competitive
8355785 west valley was where i did a lot of my first choreography and the girls who were on the team with me at that time love looking back at the routines we did then compared to those i have come up with now
8355786 dancing for wsu was probably one of the greatest highlights of my life we had so many opportunities like traveling for the ncaa tournament and met many impressive individuals from athletes to members of the board of regents to regular people who just loved being cougars
8355787 as the program built we also saw that the level of respect our student body had toward the dance team increase we now have a great relationship with the fans
8355788 it all happened really quickly we were out on the court right before tip off at the final game for the mens pac 10 tournament and my coaches called me over told me i was going to be cheerleader of the week i got my picture taken and then a week later i filled out a questionnaire and sent some more game photos to the coordinator
8355789 overall i was just really excited to be recognized as a cougar and to represent washington state university i was the first person from the dance team to be featured and it was a great way to celebrate an end of four memorable years with the crimson girls
8355790 i went to everyone in the office and told them how great she was
8355791 she called me up and asked if i would be interested in coaching at first i said no because i still had a year left of school down in pullman studying architecture
8355792 but she was pretty persistent for the following few months and eventually i said that i would apply then i had an interview with adam nebeker and the rest is sort of history
8355793 one thing i have especially enjoyed about the shock dance team is that there are a lot of similarities when it comes to dancing style as with wsu
8355794 for me it makes things easier in that i know who i am dealing with and choreographing for however a lot of these girls are also my friends so it is sometimes hard to take the position as coach and then turn around and want to hang out and go see a movie
8355795 for the girls i can see that it is easy in that they feel comfortable knowing the people next to them but at the same time it makes it hard for them to open up to girls that they didnt know prior to the team
8355796 at the beginning we practiced twice a week plus extra practices on game weeks now that we are having games every single weekend
8355797 i dont want the girls to feel overwhelmed so we have reduced it to just the night before games
8355798 i always knew that coaching was something i wanted to do so when the opportunity presented itself over and over again thanks to rachel im glad i jumped on board
8355799 i have definitely enjoyed this season getting to know all of the girls and the shock organization but i already find myself planning for next year and looking at how i could do things differently

8355809 this is clearly a significant investment and one that could take shape in a number of different ways depending on the nature and structure of broadband investment funds proposed this option will remain a key area of focus for us
8355810 we understand those assets and we are assessing our options in that space
8355811 i think its also important to note that we have a share buyback in place and that provides a valuable investment option for us
8355812 while student achievement and improving graduation rates are always on the minds of school board members this poll tells us that they are very concerned about having the proper resources to meet the rising tide of employee benefits and energy costs

8355891 currently there is something like 25 billion available for developing countries
8355892 the estimated need in 2030 would be about 130 billion a year so there is still a gap of 105 billion
8355893 most money is going to the large developing countries china india and brazil
8355894 but there is a danger that the u n process will be sidelined by hard cash
8355895 africa has a voice in the u n system africa does not have a voice in the market
8355896 in africa the type of projects that need to be funded is access to water agriculture so you can produce food with less water

8355899 pero la carta es una suma de consideraciones sociales ticas y sobre c mo manejarse con nuestros ecosistemas ante eso nadie puede oponerse pero tampoco se puede deducir que no se pueden construir centrales hidroel ctricas si no se cumplen con los requisitos correspondientes
8355900 en ese sentido la postura del obispo de ays n es un llamado de atenci n para que la patagonia chilena no se llene con proyectos industrializados y a la vez la desnaturalicen completamente
8355901 se plantea cu l deber a ser nuestra relaci n con la naturaleza don de dios que aqu en ays n abundantemente nos rodea y cu l deber a ser nuestra relaci n con el creador y con las criaturas
8355902 son una violaci n al medio ambiente y la naturaleza
8355903 porque se est queriendo usar el agua que es un don de dios que es un derecho de todos para un negocio
8355904 hasta el momento lo que ha hecho la empresa hidroays n sociedad de endesa y colb n con la que se busca construir cuatro represas en los r os pascua y baker es un proyecto de estudio de impacto ambiental y me ha tocado trabajar con ellos y enfrentarlos para que la iniciativa se adapte a nuestra regi n
8355905 bajar las reas de inundaci n capacitar a la gente de la zona para que participe en los servicios en todas las instancias el compromiso de bajar el costo de la luz en la regi n entera a la mitad de lo que cuesta en la actualidad y lo m s importante definir una l nea de transmisi n por valles donde no haya gente ni atractivos tur sticos aunque deban construirla en forma submarina
8355906 se trata de un conjunto de exigencias previas y en esa etapa estamos adem s es un absurdo que presenten a estudio de impacto ambiental las centrales hidroel ctricas sin la l nea de transmisi n porque se deben conocer las dos cosas a la vez
8355907 the presumption of innocence has been derogated and reduced to a joke while my rights have been irrevocably prejudiced
8355908 he will initially try the same tactics that milosevic and seselj tried to swamp the tribunal with motions to delay the start of the trial
8355909 we are still on track the process has speeded up
8355910 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with deforestation
8355911 we may have something in poznan pretty close to a negotiating text
8355912 in accra there have been some positives and negatives but progress has not been enough
8355913 the talks here have made it clear that sectoral approaches are not about imposing targets sectoral approaches are something that a government may or may not choose to do on a national level
8355914 the meeting has helped to crystallise some ideas said angela anderson of the washington based pew environment group
8355915 the overall situation renders lebanons borders as penetrable as was the case one year ago
8355916 achieved at most disconnected islands of progress without a decisive impact on overall border security
8355917 presence and massive redeployment of armed hezbollah elements both north and south of the litani river
8355918 continuous transfer of weapons from iran and syria to hezbollah
8355919 raises concerns of the commitment of the lebanese government to extend its authority over all its territory
8355920 we expect unifil under its renewed mandate to exert its authority to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind
8355921 accordingly is there still any doubt about the identity of the party which must be held responsible for obstructing the full implementation of resolution 1701
8355922 we will work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8355923 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8355924 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault
8355925 i think mexico needs its people it would be best to keep its people in mexico and it would give incentives for mexico to create the jobs that are needed
8355926 we think the biggest issue is the economy cavuto told tvnewser this afternoon after his fbn show ended its a dominant issue
8355927 and how about cavutos hopes for fbn as a whole
8355928 we just have to keep moving he tells tvnewser what i find encouraging is that when people get fox business they like it and when were put up against the competition they say i really like it
8355929 and being around for the inception of fox news channel cavuto says hes dealt with this before i know what its in witness protection but i also know what its like to get out of witness protection and i already see the signs he said
8355930 we remain confident that 2008 is a turning point for photochannel as we accelerate revenues from our new and existing retail partners and expect strong growth resulting in continued record revenue and transaction volumes with the launch of our new customers we are now cash flow positive and fully believe that this will continue going forward

8356061 i think ive weeded out most of the bad ones by now
8356062 you think shes going to figure out that youre talking about her
8356063 i didnt talk about her in us weekly though and thats the interview shes most likely to see
8356064 and then its time for novels whether we do it together or separately
8356065 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8356066 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8356067 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8356068 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8356069 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8356070 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8356071 ultimately it gets down to self acceptance if you accept yourself you dont give a damn what anyone else thinks

8356075 the media try to portray hypermiling as drafting that were holding everybody up and that were doing dangerous things it isnt like that
8356076 the goals of hypermiling are positive such as eliminating aggressive driving and saving energy
8356077 the most important thing for a hypermiler is to never to turn the key in the first place
8356078 any time you can walk bicycle or take public transportation you should do that rather than driving
8356079 before you turn the key place yourself three blocks ahead how will you get from where you are to that point without getting impeded by traffic or stoplights etc

8356087 el exilio f sico es mi problema personal yo lo puedo tomar bien o lo puedo tomar mal lo que es terrible es el exilio cultural el hecho de que la junta de videla en la argentina haya prohibido la publicaci n de mi ltimo libro de cuentos ese corte ese exilio es terrible porque en unos pocos a os el hecho de que esos pa ses chile argentina o uruguay est n separados de la producci n cient fica art stica e intelectual de sus mejores creadores va a dar en esos pa ses una especie de desierto espiritual en donde es perfectamente f cil lavar los cerebros y condicionar a los j venes y crear lo que los reg menes de esos pa ses buscan que es crear robots crear gente incapaz de pensar por s misma

8356093 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8356094 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8356095 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8356096 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica
8356097 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed

8356116 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8356117 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8356118 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral
8356119 primarily reflects melt in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8356120 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances
8356121 the arctic is gigantic when you have nine bears sighted in one transect route one can assume that there are likely a lot more bears swimming in open water
8356122 and investors have the right to know all the associated risks
8356123 the difference between working on a desk and trying to get work done on the little tray on an airplane

8356130 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8356131 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8356132 the weakness the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8356133 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8356141 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8356142 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8356143 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8356151 standard pizza made with fresh mozzarella a san marzano tomato sauce and topped with romano and fresh basil and we were pleasantly full but not stuffed it did cost 25 with tip though also be warned they dont do slices i tried coming here for lunch yesterday but i didnt have time to wait for a whole pizza so i went across the street to pomodoro i gave both of them 4 stars because theyre both very good and represent some of the best pizza in new york but theyre very different styles so i recommend trying both if you really want a taste of little italy jan 2007 you would think after having pizza twice in a day courtesy of greenwich village food tour that we would be all pizzad out but we just could not resist eating at the famous lombardis pizza want more than 1 kind of pizza but not necessary having to order more than 1 request to have them do half and half my boyfriend and i order one pizza with half being the classic margherita and the other half their famous white sauce pizza i was not a big fan of the white sauce pizza but the margherita was pizza at its best for a californian this is simply the best ny pizza ive ever had the ingredients were fresh the sausage was actually carved out instead of ball shaped ones you get out here considering ny pizza is my favorite style i was in heaven for the duration of the 2 slices we went for lunch and got seated right away the waitress was friendly and informative the only complaint i have is i didnt order enough for satisfaction i thought this was great coal oven pizza had meatball mushroom and onion and everything about it was great ive heard its not the best pizza in nyc but its the best ive had since moving here historical pizza place with lots of locals and looking satisfied and having fun primo ingredients and delicious pizza with perfect thin crispy yet chewy crust check out the back where they bake the pizza in the big red hot fire oven its like a pizza factory and the chefs have it down to a rhythmic science dont bother going all the way into little italy for a great slice or pie this place borders east soho and has lots of nice little shops and other restaurants without the herds of people like on mulberry or broadway what can i say about this place that hasnt already been said about god when i read about this place i thought it was going to be a hole in the wall shop dealing by the slice i was surprised at the nice decor even the bathrooms were very clean although its the size of a broom closet the wall is probably less than a foot away from the actual throne i dont know how anyone could do anything but stand next to it i ordered a beer their pitchers do about 4 pints for 18 bucks or single pints are 5 dollars they have stella sam adams brooklyn lager and one other i cant remember on tap more choices by the bottle and i got the small pie 14

8356170 they dont think of the capacity of the vehicle itself
8356171 because the vehicle can handle up to 2 000 pounds and 250 pounds of tongue weight they think they should go out and buy a pop up camper then they go out and overload the vehicle itself and because they cant get everything in the vehicle they load it in the trailer pretty soon the springs the bearings and the tires start to be stressed on the trailer and thats when you see trailers sitting by the side of the road
8356172 youre driving down the road and the first thing you see is the back of the trailer taking up a lane and a half as it goes down the road
8356173 thats because the front of the trailer is low and its back is high
8356174 as you increase the load in the vehicle you can increase the pressure inside the coil springs that will allow the vehicle to carry the maximum load its intended to carry and still manage to keep the whole rig level it wont get weighed down
8356175 once you arrive at a campsite remove the camper and prepare to go tour the town in the tow vehicle alone then you can reduce the pressure from the air springs back to normal ride height
8356176 you can basically have your cake and eat it too you have enough suspension when the trailer is hooked up but monday through friday you reduce the pressure and its back to a normal vehicle
8356177 in a panic situation where you need to slam on the brakes the accelerometer knows that and applies the same braking to the trailer

8356197 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8356198 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8356199 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8356200 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8356201 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8356202 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8356203 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8356204 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8356205 in the deep ocean there is a strong interaction between viruses and prokaryotes which helps sustain the deep sea ecosystems independently of the nutrient inputs coming from the surface waters

8356364 obviously starting up any advanced factory like these has its load of start up kinks to be worked through its a lot of work
8356365 at this time we are focused on product and customers and want to be known for making money not raising money
8356366 this financing was literally just a side effect of the industry partnerships we have established to implement solar utility power

8356377 this heinous crime shows the hatred that the leaders and the members of the occupying force have against the quran and the muslim people
8356378 we must establish boldly and forcefully that nothing is more pro israel than pressing for immediate sustained and meaningful american action to end the conflict between israel and its neighbors this requires a dramatic change in the dynamic of discussion about israel in the american jewish community and in the american body politic it demands an end to simplistic slogans and name calling that effectively shuts down debate and discussion in a community not known as shy and retiring in expressing its opinions my history demands that i say this our future and israels future demands that we act on it
8356379 for israels sake moderate american jews must find their voice

8356387 no est dicha la ltima palabra estamos explicando que el deporte no debe sufrir este tipo de disminuciones porque cambia el ritmo de crecimiento el presidente le puso un buen ritmo y debemos seguir hac a arriba la econom a empieza a crecer y le empezamos a bajar al deporte es un poco contradictorio la pol tica y la actitud que se toma
8356388 la inflaci n hay que controlarla pero no creo que us 20 millones para el deporte producir una inflaci n o la controlar el ministro dice que todo tiene que bajarse para que no suba la inflaci n pero el deporte que es de inter s social y es parte de la educaci n ayuda ha disminuir los gastos de salud y va contra las drogas

8356399 this trip took place last thursday and she has gone to the united states on a personal visit
8356400 these are all rumours and her trip proves these rumours wrong
8356401 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8356402 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8356403 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8356404 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8356405 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8356406 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8356407 ne vous inqui tez pas jai plus de chance de mourir en voiture sur lautoroute en rentrant vous voir que dans un avion
8356408 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8356409 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8356410 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8356411 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8356412 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favourite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8356413 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8356414 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in centre and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8356415 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8356416 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8356417 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8356418 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8356419 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8356420 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8356421 i know you dont want to be with me and i dont want to make you feel guilty
8356422 yeah not like that last pope that guy was a dick
8356423 they are tight ends that dont necessarily get lost in the mix
8356424 they are that offenses main receiving threat i like the versatility of all three of those guys
8356425 i keeping working hard and i always have that attitude of never settle for what ive done its possible down the road
8356426 i think it plays with the defense a little bit and it works to our advantage for me to be able to stretch the field
8356427 it will help because we dont necessarily have to go to a four receiver set to be effective
8356428 we can do a lot of things out of the two tight end set we can run the ball we can pass the ball run screen plays we can do a lot of different things and i think some of that stuff will play out as we get into the regular season
8356429 i think you saw dante emerge toward the latter part of the season
8356430 hes very athletic he can do some good things for us he catches the ball well and he runs extremely smooth so that can be a big asset for us
8356431 i have never judged my game speed on 40 times
8356432 ive always thought that some people have really fast 40s but they dont have that same speed on the field
8356433 i thought two guys both ryne robinson and dante rosario we called on early last year and i think they showed vast improvement throughout last season
8356434 again thats typical of any job the more you do it the better you get and those guys in particularly dante i thought raised their game as the season went on
8356435 i did it all of the time in practice but unfortunately i had guys in front of me everywhere ive been
8356436 in kansas city dante hall was there for three years and then they brought eddie drummond in my last year we had guys that were getting to the pro bowl in front of me so i havent had the opportunity to showcase what i can do
8356437 hopefully its helped him because i know i like things a certain way
8356438 when were installing when quarterbacks coach passing game coordinator mike mccoy or wide receivers coach richard williamson are going over the passing plays theyll say how things are going to be done and if theres any kind of question well raise it up the receivers will bring up a question ok now wait a minute lets talk about this so we try to get on the same page hopefully that helps him
8356439 on the contrary if we leave out the first images and the sound of the page being torn it could be a film by the islamist mujahideen
8356440 as i discussed at a thread at dean esmays blog the film is its own best counter argument it is so over the top that it undermines itself
8356441 if some other cult tried to tell you the truth was actually a bearded man in the sky 6000 years ago youd laugh like hell

8356497 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
8356498 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
8356499 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
8356500 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
8356501 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects

8356517 todays tools are able to manage various types of content and put specific types of content onto specific devices
8356518 what is truly needed however and what we expect to see emerge over the next few years are tools that unlock the value of content in the digital age by formatting and managing content for device independence when content becomes reusable across multiple delivery channels its value increases enormously which will foster investment in developing the next generation of content management tools

8356698 we are ready to make decisions including within the osce and the un to increase the number of international observers to specify their mandate and to take other measures involving international organizations necessary to thwart new attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia
8356699 as president i will turn to the russian leadership with that request
8356700 we invite specialists from the russian federation to take a number of posts in the new government there is nothing unusual in it
8356701 i want to stress that these countries are involved in south ossetian peoples genocide
8356702 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8356703 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8356704 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8356705 they can say as much as they want my duty as a juror is to be fair and impartial but theyre human beings theyre not computers the absolute depravity of what occurred there has to have a biasing effect
8356706 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8356707 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8356708 inconsistent with my and i think our common understanding of the principle of territorial integrity and the fundamental international rights of nations and is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8356709 this decision was taken at the highest level of the pentagon
8356710 etre libre ce nest pas seulement se d barrasser de ses cha nes cest vivre dune fa on qui respecte et renforce la libert des autres
8356711 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
8356712 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8356713 what i dont understand is why are animals made of meat
8356714 hi all thanks for all your lovely comments re me being on
8356715 the men took all gold coins and six computers which were connected to all the surveillance cameras and the cameras
8356716 mama what is consider yourself warned if you click through teabag
8356717 well thank you for asking me that haley i am so proud you came to me to ask that but can i consult nana before i answer that yes its naughty so it puts me in an awkward position between answering your question and preserving your innocence
8356718 this is not a word for kids to use and not an activity for kids to do
8356719 thereafter the accused would transfer the information to the computer and produce a cloned card the accused usually charged r300 per card
8356720 there is a gross negligence on the part of officials to manage migration and understand other africans there is a need for a humane and sensible migration policy in south africa
8356721 we have to face the challenge of migrants in south africa instead of panicking about them
8356722 government should do much to educate south africans about other africans
8356723 there is complete disconnectedness between various government departments home affairs department officials treat our african migrants as a nuisance and without respect
8356724 2 now if you cant read your mail like any literate human being then you need to be shot down like the filthy wolves i pray for lots of deep tracking snow and good flying weather if the adfg needs to borrow my hammer to crush some puppy skulls give me a call
8356725 john from dodge city shared this pat roberts is an asshole
8356726 the e mail was in no way a reflection on julie merz jim slattery the jim slattery for senate campaign or even my personal views
8356727 technical issues on the part of our software vendor are no excuse for my behavior and i take full responsibility and ask for your forgiveness in this matter
8356728 these e mails get more pathetic as they go on this was not a malfunction a person directed by jim slattery wrote these words deliberately now they are upset because they got caught
8356729 he could have stepped up to the plate personally like a statesman and taken responsibility for his staff and the climate of name calling and childishness he has fostered instead he and his team chose to throw a junior staffer under the bus and hoped no one would notice
8356730 these two alleyways are in the existing parking lot of the church property and pose no public safety or public works issue if vacated
8356731 in past years we have been very successful in finalizing the proposed budget document utilizing only one work session
8356732 with no funds from a police levy or earnings tax we wont be able to contract with any other agency such as the sheriffs department in providing policing services
8356733 we dont want to get behind on any road projects wed like to have an annual maintenance program
8356734 we still want to be able to provide at least minimal road maintenance so we dont have to address a big problem in a couple of years
8356735 people are like hey he doesnt go on the internet
8356736 my answer thus far has been like if thats honestly what youre going to decide the election on thats cool if thats whats important to you
8356737 barack obama was first elected to the illinois senate in 1996 i remember that year
8356738 to say that i as a young person can remember a time when barack obama wasnt even in politics shows how inexperienced he may be
8356739 i didnt become a republican because you know i liked an elephant better than a donkey
8356740 i looked at the issues and i have an opinion on those issues and it just so happens the republicans share those same opinions
8356741 but when it comes to figuring out what theyre going to do and what our opinions are i feel like they dont see us as having enough life experience to know what were talking about
8356742 in our generation its really hard to be a staunch conservative
8356743 i had never heard the other side of the argument ever
8356744 on a lot of college campuses its more surprising to come out as a republican than to come out as gay
8356745 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
8356746 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8356747 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8356748 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8356749 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8356750 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
8356751 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty
8356752 there is a limit with the number of overseas players we can play and a limit to the budget i dont know how much pietersen or flintoff will be available next year with the ashes going on thats a big competition for them
8356753 we need players who can play for us for a longer time and gel with the team not coming and going like that it is a team sport and last year shane warnes side rajasthan won through a team ethic not big names
8356754 jammen du sagde jo du ikke var s god til at strikke mor

8356757 el cl sico signific una buena sacudida el capit n del equipo ha transmitido su punto de vista su trayectoria su m stica olimpista porque cuesta que un chico que viene de afuera asimile lo que es la pasi n y la presi n de la gente
8356758 hay mucho que recorrer todav a pero estamos convencidos que es el momento de olimpia
8356759 u cat lica se hace fuerte en mitad de cancha
8356760 hemos controlado cerca de 212 buses a 1 612 pasajeros y hemos comprobado que uno de cada 10 no ha pagado la tarifa por lo tanto se le conmina a que la pague o a que descienda del bus para que no pueda continuar su viaje
8356761 estoy muy contento que lo est n haciendo porque ya era injusticia que alguna gente no paga y otros que pagamos nos vemos con la necesidad de irnos de pie incluso y hay gente que ni siquiera colabora con el sistema
8356762 excelente porque hay mucha gente que no paga su pasaje entonces encuentro absurdo que algunos s lo hagan y otros no me parece excelente idea del ministerio que fiscalicen
8356763 h ganlo cuando los buses vienen llenos no ahora ahora vamos a trabajar
8356764 i presented the first three chapters of my graphic novel ivy at stumptown
8356765 but i wanted to do a story specifically tailored for an eight page format so i came up with an original idea for mdhp i tossed around several ideas before coming up with this ghost story parody which i chose specifically because it seemed like the most fun to draw i also wanted to tailor the art a bit differently in this work than in my graphic novel both because it would be in color in the final version and because i try to test new ways of working in all my short stories and side projects
8356766 i do try to work differently according to the project
8356767 right now im in the middle of a 200 plus page book whose style i am trying to keep consistent from beginning to end so i dont feel like i have a lot of freedom to play around with new styles and ways of mark making i save that sort of trial and error for new short pieces if it works great ive learned something new and if it doesnt well its only a couple pages and i can try something else next time
8356768 right now im studying up on a lot of the newer works coming out from people like eleanor davis and dash shaw im seeing people head out of the gate with an innate understanding of the comics medium and a real dedication to improvisation and innovation and paired with the more mature works from people who have been doing indie comics for 20 years i think theres a huge range of work right now leaving impressions on me
8356769 i self published my first minicomic roadside in college and that got me into the trade by mail and zine scene
8356770 i used roadside to develop my storytelling skills and hone my style and when that wrapped up i spent a couple of years preparing the script to ivy and contributing short stories to anthologies i have a few other full length books already written that just need fleshing out so i can pull those out of storage later on and see which one needs to get completed next
8356771 i was so scared that my work would get ripped apart autopsied if you will
8356772 but scott made some great suggestions and helped me pull it together in a finished way it was also nice to have someone prodding me to get the work done since i usually work without deadlines and as you can see my book is still in progress it was a great experience all around

8356777 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8356778 six point cease fire agreement which president medvedev signed on aug 12 2008
8356779 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect lives
8356780 according to our information they are even starting to supply new types of weapons restoring the military infrastructure that was used in the aggression
8356781 virtually all states that are supplying arms to georgia are nato member countries
8356782 these weapons which were supplied to georgia both overtly and covertly were eventually used against russian citizens
8356783 overnight at about 2 oclock in the morning coalition forces killed our best player rahmet wali
8356784 he had played on the afghan national cricket team from 2002 to 2006 he took part in games that were played in kuwait india and pakistan so he had made official trips to those countries as a representative of afghanistan and he brought honor to this country he was martyred in his house it was a cruel act
8356785 thats the best thing thats happened to me that hes with me
8356786 the best thing that couldve happened was that the baby survived
8356787 the good thing that helped the baby was that his lungs were well developed and thats what saved his life
8356788 shes the one who did everything in reality i only worked
8356789 it seems like people are good when you dont know their intentions
8356790 we are not controlling it and are not blockading it this is nonsense
8356791 battleships do not normally deliver aid and this is gunboat diplomacy it does not make the situation more stable
8356792 virtually all states that are supplying arms to georgia are nato member countries
8356793 we are controlling territorial waters and the adjacent area ensuring shipping safety and preventing the smuggling of arms and military vehicles
8356794 we are not planning to increase our black sea naval group although russia has the ability
8356795 amid natos strengthening of its black sea deployments the fleet has started observing its moves
8356796 we russia have a bilateral agreement with ukraine which we have not violated in any way and which states the terms of our fleets presence
8356797 according to our information nato ships are in the black sea and their numbers are increasing
8356798 we are not planning to increase the number of our ships there but everything depends on regional stability menyailo said
8356799 we are controlling territorial waters and the adjacent area ensuring shipping safety and preventing the smuggling of arms and military vehicles
8356800 in both cases the center started a war in kosovo and south ossetia as well as abkhazia but the conflicts were halted in different ways through the ruthless inhuman bombardment of belgrade in the case of kosovo and without punishing tbilisi for its attacks on sukhumi abkhazias capital
8356801 a ceasefire was agreed peacekeepers were deployed and mechanisms for talks established belgrade has never tried to use military force or cast doubt on negotiations since 1999 but they were destroyed by kosovo albanians supported by the west and it was tbilisi that undermined the settlement mechanisms in south ossetia and abkhazia
8356802 therefore drawing parallels is irrelevant here and the difference is evident between belgrades policy towards kosovo and how saakashvilis regime behaved towards south ossetia and abkhazia
8356803 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8356804 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
8356805 under the decree recognizing independence of both republics which i have signed our country will help abkhazia and south ossetia to ensure their security and if they are attacked we will certainly offer them appropriate support
8356806 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
8356807 until recently we tried to help restore georgias state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
8356808 as to our involvement in other conflicts we naturally are not going to do this
8356809 however russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the entire length of its border this is absolutely clear
8356810 there is a recognition that none of the international aid is going to materialize without the mdc at least the majority section of the mdc being represented in government
8356811 we have completed the assembly of a launch pad and are continuing to develop the angara launch complex
8356812 i hope that the first test launch of a lighter version of the angara will be conducted as planned in 2010
8356813 in other words imagine that in addition to this year another four years will be under your management work with this in mind act and plan accordingly
8356814 even if ayatollah khamenei would want deep down in his heart ahmadinejad to be the winner of irans future presidential elections he wouldnt express his wish so clearly and publicly
8356815 government officials officials in charge of irans official news agency were probably so happy about khameneis comments that they didnt realize the way they published his comments was not in the interests of the islamic republic
8356816 the remarks by irans supreme leader are a sign of his unconditional support for ahmadinejads government a government that came to power with his special backing
8356817 the problem ahmadinejads government is facing and to a certain degree khamenei is that gradually significant numbers of hard liners have turned into ahamdinejads critics because of his economic policies and his performance on the international scene which has put iran under the shadow of sanctions isolation and even military attack
8356818 the problems that exist in iran cannot be ignored by those living there
8356819 if we interpret ayatollah khameneis comments as a done deal meaning that ahmadinejad will be irans next president whether we like it or not then this is tantamount to the end of the republic system of the establishment
8356820 but i dont think this is the case even if the leader supports such view in the end i think its up to the citizens to decide whether they want ahmadinejad to be president for a second time or not
8356821 its nothing unusual not just one term or two terms ahamdinejad can remain in power for as many terms as khamenei would want him anyhow i hope the people of iran will have a say
8356822 russia is disappointed and concerned over north koreas decision to suspend the disablement of nuclear facilities and consider reactivating its yongbyon reactor
8356823 we are urging north korea to display true commitment to the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula continue the disablement of the nuclear facilities in yongbyon and complete this process by the end of october this year as was agreed upon at a meeting of the heads of the delegations at the six party talks on the korean peninsula nuclear problem on july 12 this year
8356824 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8356825 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8356826 mr biden i want to know if you believe yourself to be in the pocket of the riaa and other big media lobbyists who are obviously not on the side of the consumer the riaa obviously has no consideration for the rights privacy and general well being of their own consumers and seem only interested in slowing down the natural progression of their own industry in an effort to increase their bottom line also how much are they paying you
8356827 what are your views on digital rights management and copyright law what rights do you believe consumers should have with products they own
8356828 with the furor over the impending rate hike for internet radio stations wouldnt a good solution be for streaming internet stations to simply not play riaa affiliated labels music and focus on independent artists
8356829 your honor the defendant beamed our intellectual property to everyone in the universe even allowing for signal degredation its possible he reached billions of civilizations

8356836 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8356837 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8356838 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8356839 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8356840 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8356841 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8356842 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8356845 thats one thing the republicans do that democrats dont do
8356846 the republicans have an al davis just win baby philosophy
8356847 the democrats unfortunately want to hold grudges you want to hold a grudge you dont win the white house
8356848 its not about me its not about my wife its about this party taking back the white house
8356849 sitting on the sidelines saying youre going to support mccain because youre ticked off then you better shut up for the next four years because you were part of the problem
8356850 i expect that the vast majority of the activists that supported her will back obama for many of the reasons she described last night
8356851 they may not love obama but the idea of four more years of republican rule will be largely repugnant to them
8356852 its too early to say whether hillarys speech failed but the early indications are that it didnt succeed

8356860 i was happy and surprised to see how the lebanon fans reacted
8356861 whats your pain level on a scale of 1 10
8356862 some people came up to me a few weeks ago and told me they were following us from place to place coming to bars just to see us play
8356863 that moved mountains for me just getting compliments from people is what keeps us all going
8356864 were still young as a band but weve hit the ground running
8356865 most of our gigs we get from word of mouth
8356866 we all bring a lot of different backgrounds into the band and it reflects on our music
8356867 originally we would just play out as nick and shawn
8356868 i knew a guy and shawn knew a guy and we just came together
8356869 we dont want to be known as a cover band but we do a very good job on a lot of songs
8356870 we all have day jobs and then were out until one in the morning one or two nights week the bands like a small business in and of itself
8356871 i would hope we all have aspirations to one day have our music pay the bills

8356881 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
8356882 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
8356883 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
8356884 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
8356885 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
8356886 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
8356887 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
8356888 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
8356889 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
8356890 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in
8356891 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
8356892 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other

8356896 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games

8356913 i didnt think anything of it but it got worse and worse and worse
8356914 i remember after it got really bad i looked in the mirror one day i always took good care of myself and i started screaming and called my husband in there there were indentions in my face
8356915 there was a weird sensation in there it scared me to death
8356916 it was just a small leak though not too bad we told our landlord about the leak didnt tell him it was making me sick i didnt realize it it never got repaired
8356917 he coughed up tons of mucus literally a coke can of mucus a day
8356918 his stomach is all swollen they think something is leaking in his gut
8356919 i had blood coming from my eyes and the burning i could feel the pain in my chest in my stomach i could just feel it it was the most pain i have ever been in my life
8356920 i was spending nights down at the huddle house because i had nowhere else to go
8356921 we were homeless for a while if i can prevent anyone from going through this i want to people dont understand about cross contamination we took everything with us and that was the mistake we made
8356922 i remember sitting on the table with blood coming out of my eyes and blisters on my eyes and contortions on my face and they wanted me to talk to a psychiatrist
8356923 toxins attacked my central nervous system my face was all twisted i couldnt speak i couldnt think the pain was horrible my husband just started crying to see me in that condition
8356924 chronic pain is one thing but this pain you cant even imagine
8356925 your flesh feels like somebody beat you up with a hammer nobody takes it serious they think you can just paint over it somebody has to have the courage to speak out
8356926 people are allergic to mold and that varies by person
8356927 its weird to me that they would go on the news on wjbf with mary morrison and say toxic mold didnt exist
8356928 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8356929 this system is an ideal product for upgrading existing compact sized embedded computers to a state of the art processing unit with pci express connectivity on the backplane
8356930 formed a technical subcommittee to extend the current compactpci standard for both the 3u and 6u form factors mainly for applications in industry avionics transportation medical and in telecommunications systems that use cpci

8356932 dracula year zero is sort of the origin tale that mixes the historical prince vlad of transylvania with sort of fictionalized bram stoker take
8356933 i mean the teeth are really important i think frank langella in the dracula movie that was made in the 70s i think he didnt want to have teeth in the movie but no i like the teeth i want to see girls with a lot of teeth
8356934 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8356935 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8356936 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8356937 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8356938 je suis pass e c t de mon match je ne suis jamais parvenue rentrer dans la partie c tait la branl e jai t prise par l v nement javais envie de trop bien faire

8356940 celui qui marche avec les sages deviendra sages mais celui qui a des relations avec les stupides sen trouvera mal
8356941 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8356942 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8356943 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8356944 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8356945 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8356946 when i was four years old my parents both academic ballet dancers said that i love ballet i believed them and still believe
8356947 my credo in life is that a person should do what is easier for him to do but should do it with all his efforts for me its easy to stage performances i enjoy it and try to do my best
8356948 im totally uneducated in the styles of modern dancing and try to cultivate this feature
8356949 if a person is talented he can create his own language without using any existing techniques and styles
8356950 dancers are crippled in a way they study classic dance duos character and national dance everything but modern dance at the same time modern dance accounts for 50 percent of all performances nowadays
8356951 i was offered a spot on the jury but we are going to spain and i think they will find someone cheaper to be there all the time instead of me flying back and force
8356952 i understood that such offers are made only once in lifetime and agreed at once thats how the kyiv modern ballet was founded
8356953 i would like to but there is a problem finding a good renting place for regular work
8356954 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war
8356955 were on the lookout for 18 30 year old guys and girls to come and take part you should be cool with your own urban style be able to dance and ready to have a party with the sugababes
8356956 youll need to be available from 8am until midnight while we cannot pay you for taking part we can feed you
8356957 they should be embarrassed to ask professional dancers to do the shoot and travel there for a full days work unpaid especially for a pop group like the sugababes
8356958 no professional dancers are being asked to do anything for free
8356959 el ejecutivo nacional crear un punto de interconexi n o punto de acceso a la red de proveedores de servicios de internet con la finalidad de manejar el tr fico con origen y destino en el espacio geogr fico de la rep blica

8356962 tiene que demostrar el estado la necesidad de hacer esa reserva sobre los medios radioel ctricos y las telecomunicaciones
8356963 lo que hay es una extensi n de las atribuciones del ejecutivo y sin ning n tipo de control institucional son decisiones unilaterales

8356966 as far as research results are made public researchers can use these facilities for free
8356967 researchers will be able to study some lighter atoms that x rays cannot analyse most notably those of water
8356968 this means they could unzip the mechanism of any living organism whose main part consists of water and this will hopefully lead to further development of for example cosmetics and frozen food products
8356969 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8356970 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8356971 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8356972 we are disappointed at the way we played in one day internationals we have not been consistent especially with the bat
8356973 we definitely need to look at that maybe state that after a certain period people can come back

8356981 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8356982 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8356983 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8356984 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8356985 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8356986 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8356987 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8356988 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8356989 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8356990 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8356991 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8356992 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8356993 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8356994 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8356995 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8356996 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8356997 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8356998 no one works for someone we all just work together
8356999 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8357000 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8357001 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8357002 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8357003 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8357004 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8357005 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8357006 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8357007 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8357008 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8357009 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8357010 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8357011 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8357012 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8357013 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8357014 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8357015 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8357016 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8357017 i think it will increase awareness of bicycling as a viable form of transportation right now the infrastructure for biking just doesnt exist in the community hopefully this project will succeed and drive the development of such an infrastructure
8357018 not only does cycling keep riders fit its also better for the environment more foot and cycle traffic equals less automobile traffic
8357019 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8357020 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8357021 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8357022 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8357023 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8357024 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8357025 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8357026 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8357027 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8357028 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8357029 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8357030 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8357031 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8357032 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8357033 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8357034 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8357035 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8357036 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8357037 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8357038 the first thing we wanted to know was if there was really a problem
8357039 was fish collecting making a significant impact on actual numbers of fish
8357040 the theory of an mpa is that if we close an area to fishing the fish are no longer being impacted by humans so the population increases spills out and seeds adjacent areas
8357041 so it protects the resource while allowing sustainability in surrounding fished areas
8357042 we found that the council worked quite well it helped reduce conflict
8357043 it wasnt perfect but it worked pretty well as a way to both resolve disputes and also make collaborative decisions about fishery management
8357044 there are always social barriers and differences no matter where you go
8357045 it takes time and a lot of networking you have to develop trust and talk story as hawaiians say
8357046 its important to recognize that people are an important part of both the problem and the solution in these cases
8357047 you can pass laws to regulate fisheries but if you dont change peoples underlying attitudes and beliefs they wont be effective so we are trying to do both at the same time
8357048 lee throttled the tigers again and is super amazing boy howdy
8357049 you just put the last two guys on base and have thrown 108 pitches and we have an 8 run lead
8357050 please work a clean inning in a meaningless blowout just to show me youve still got it
8357051 dont you mean strike out the side in a one run game for the save
8357052 its cliff lee against meatball mcgee jensen lewis is the closer and you are eddie mujica if youre going to get an outing itll have to be garbage time just promise me youll keep it clean okay
8357053 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8357054 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8357055 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8357056 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8357057 leila lopes faz um filme porn seduzindo um padre e ningu m fala nada
8357058 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8357059 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8357060 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8357061 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8357062 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8357063 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8357064 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8357065 no ha realizado los ex menes contenidos en esas rdenes y ha cobrado a fonasa como si estas se hubieran realizado por un monto calculamos superior a los 317 millones de pesos

8357067 i am just going to denver to provide some balance to whats going on there on behalf of my candidate senator mccain
8357068 hes on vacation ive been told thats all im allowed to say hes on vacation
8357069 ill even go one step further with you than ive gone with other reporters

8357087 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8357088 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8357089 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8357090 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8357091 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8357092 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8357093 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8357094 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8357095 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8357096 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8357097 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8357098 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8357099 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8357100 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8357101 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8357102 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8357103 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8357104 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8357105 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8357106 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8357107 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8357108 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8357109 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8357110 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8357111 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8357112 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8357113 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8357114 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8357115 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8357116 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8357117 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8357118 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8357119 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8357120 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8357121 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8357122 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8357123 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8357124 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8357125 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8357126 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8357127 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8357128 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8357129 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8357130 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8357131 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8357132 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8357133 somehow gotten into the container which caused it to have an exothermic reaction or self heat and emit gas
8357134 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8357135 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8357136 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8357137 i would like to tell samsung that our rates have gone up from now next time on you have to give us more i think you give a lot to the world body but very little to the indian body so next time youll have to pay us more
8357138 its very important that corporate support is absolutely essential a lot needs to be done to train our athletes to world standards and corporate help is absolutely necessary
8357139 what we recognize is that there are some individuals who have excelled and they need that little bit of extra support to get over that last hurdle or last hump which hold them back from that extra practice that extra energy and support to make the difference between a medal and a non medal thats what we focus on and sponsor
8357140 one of the larger funding rounds weve seen in the solar energy marketplace
8357141 nanosolar has plenty of company in the photo voltaic and concentrating solar power start up space
8357142 companies such as heliovolt solfocus and suniva have all taken part in investment rounds exceeding 50 million
8357143 we have a short list of the industrys most experienced most scalable and most bankable customers
8357144 we dont announce names at this point we have many billions under contract
8357145 obviously starting up any advanced factory like these has its load of start up kinks to be worked through its a lot of work
8357146 at this time we are focused on product and customers and want to be known for making money not raising money

8357365 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
8357366 this does look nice it might just be enough to get me to go back to firefox on my xubuntu computer opera runs so much faster on it but this looks to be too useful to pass up
8357367 a fantastic dyke comedy in the tradition of the player director michelle ehlen spins a spot on satire of the movie industry while examining butch femme dynamics and the politics of lesbian relationships
8357368 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8357369 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8357370 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8357371 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8357372 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8357373 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8357374 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8357375 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8357376 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8357377 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8357378 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8357379 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8357380 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8357381 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8357382 well let you know if we can use your services
8357383 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8357384 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8357385 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8357386 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8357387 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8357388 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8357389 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8357390 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8357391 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8357392 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8357393 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8357394 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8357395 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8357396 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8357397 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8357398 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8357399 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8357400 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8357401 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8357402 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8357403 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8357404 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8357405 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8357406 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8357407 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8357408 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8357409 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8357410 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8357411 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8357412 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8357413 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8357414 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8357415 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8357416 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8357417 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8357418 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8357419 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8357420 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8357421 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8357422 wir haben das ziel unseren derzeitigen marktanteil von ber 10 prozent langfristig mindestens zu halten
8357423 dar ber hinaus verfolgen wir auch kaliprojekte im ausland wir werden uns dazu aber erst u ern wenn die dinge klar sind
8357424 mit marcell jansen setzen wir ebenso wie mit dem transfer von alex silva unseren weg der verpflichtungen hoch ambitionierter spieler mit gro er perspektive fort marcell hat sein internationales niveau bereits nachgewiesen und wird uns deutlich voran bringen
8357425 das ist ein transfer von langer hand wir hatten uns schon vor dem wechsel zu bayern m nchen intensiv um marcell bem ht er ist auf der linken seite vielseitig einsetzbar und wir erwarten uns durch ihn eine belebung unseres fl gelspiels
8357426 ich gehe davon aus dass sie mehr als 30 prozent halten werden
8357427 das beinhaltet auch alle strukturen ber die wir zuvor heftig gestritten haben
8357428 das vorherrschende gef hl ist nicht dass die situation viel besser geworden ist aber der grad der abw rtsbewegung k nnte nachgelassen haben in diesem umfeld ist das genug um optimismus zu erzeugen
8357429 die diskussion ber sinkende zinsen in der eurozone ist verfr ht
8357430 ich f hle mich mit der gegenw rtige geldpolitik wohl
8357431 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8357432 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8357433 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8357434 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8357435 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8357436 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8357437 she wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur
8357438 i didnt want v p anyway postmaster generals where the real powers at
8357439 oh my god this can really happen a black man named barack obama might be elected president
8357440 here it will be a lot less time in the car and more time getting to know parishioners the people a lot more parishes to get to know and familiarize myself with so thats going to be a big difference
8357441 i think the challenge will be getting to know the people and keeping them in my mind in the right place so i remember which parish theyre from but i think with time that will come also and im looking forward to that challenge also
8357442 we want to do whatever we can to make sure this doesnt happen any more and thats what im committed to and to help those who have been hurt to help them heal in some way
8357443 i would say things im very interested in are catholic education promotion of vocation to the priesthood enabling the laity to grow spiritually to grow intellectually with the great treasury of knowledge of the church and to be able to live their faith in our world today
8357444 i want to listen to the people and see what their needs are so im not creating things that dont really work here
8357445 ive been a little bit around green bay to get to know green bay a little bit and in the next few weeks ill be getting around to the whole diocese
8357446 so its a joy to be here and i really look forward to my time leading this diocese hopefully it will be a long time
8357447 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8357448 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8357449 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8357450 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8357451 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8357452 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8357453 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8357454 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8357455 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8357456 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8357457 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8357458 who are open to doing something on the production side
8357459 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8357460 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8357461 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8357462 as i have reflected on the great issues facing this generation in the life of the church i have become more and more convinced that the answers are to be found through a prayerful faithful and creative engagement with the deposit of faith presented in the documents of the second vatican council and its great summary the catechism of the catholic church
8357463 the vision of fit for mission church is the vision of the second vatican council
8357464 however the questions and challenges that the council fathers saw in embryo we now face in full force such as the challenge of secular humanism the question of moral values in a scientific technological culture and the increasing tensions caused by reason sundered from faith
8357465 all catholics who love the church and care deeply about the future of catholicism in our country
8357466 i know that many of you share my sense of pressing responsibility to foster and promote an authentic catholic identity resisting the pressures to compromise even abandon the truths of our faith
8357467 the majority of our energy and charisms as the people of god are focused on being gathered through the sacraments
8357468 lay liturgical ministries are well developed in most parishes though there are exceptions there is a good deal of collaboration between most clergy and laity in service of the liturgy
8357469 though we are strengthened and healed by the lord through his word and sacraments the majority of us are not responding to our lords call to go out on his mission of hope in particular mission in the parishes with families and young people are undeveloped or underdeveloped with a few exceptions
8357470 part two of gaudium et spes goes on to identify five urgent problems that caused major anxiety in the 1960s
8357471 forty years on i believe the same five areas cause equal anxiety among most people marriage and the family culture social economic life political life war and peace
8357472 just as the council fathers before me i want to encourage you all to attempt to read the signs of the times in the light of the gospel the council and human experience
8357473 there are some things in life which are so important that to dissent from them is to lose the whole meaning of life
8357474 i have written this document in the hope that through our far reaching fit for mission review in the diocese of lancaster we may realize with joy the great gift with which we have been entrusted
8357475 when we all hold true to the beauty and truth of the church established by jesus for the glory of the father in the living presence of the holy spirit then the true glory of gods church will shine out for all to see
8357476 our church will be as intended a creative and liberating force that takes us out into the world and which releases the world from the pains of creation to realize its full potential
8357477 we think that there is a need for careful monitoring of the serum uric acid and lipid profile in patients receiving topiramate
8357478 more emphasis should be put on the topiramate related complications
8357479 is this a bug in my code or a bug in their shitty driver
8357480 hey theres a strong possibility that thats a driver bug
8357481 approval of verizons video franchise is great news for the residents of snohomish county who will soon have more choice for their video entertainment
8357482 we look forward to reaching similar agreements with other washington communities
8357483 memories even epic ones are perishable from their very formation even in people who dont soak their brains in mood altering chemicals
8357484 yes lets do mescaline and sure lets wander out onto that trestle bridge hundreds of feet over the st croix river im pretty sure well hear of a train if it comes right
8357485 in todays vernacular my father believed very strongly that you could be a very strong catholic without being a wimp people used to love to gravitate to him he was a wonderful raconteur he loved to eat and drink and be merry he was extremely generous with his money to people who were down and out i could remember on christmas day how people would be around our christmas dinner table thered be the cop on the beat because my dad would run into him or some alcoholic he had very strong principles for himself and for our family he never pretended to be perfect but he would say hed keep trying
8357486 each poem is a poem for one retreatant and the order of the poems is the order that they happened to come to the interviews
8357487 your favorite great blog post from other blog than yours
8357488 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8357489 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8357490 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8357491 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8357492 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8357493 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8357494 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8357495 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8357496 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8357497 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8357498 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8357499 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8357500 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8357501 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8357502 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8357503 good introduction to bpm for the modelling and execution of business processes
8357504 the orange order deserves credit for what i believe are sincere and convincing efforts to promote dialogue and understanding these should be acknowledged and reciprocated
8357505 attacks on orange halls such as those which took place last week around armagh deserve to be unequivocally condemned they are symptomatic of a sectarian pathology which is evil and has to be continually challenged in ourselves and every aspect of social religious and political life
8357506 to me as grand secretary it is deeply rewarding to hear from the cardinal that he accepts our bona fides
8357507 to me in terms of community relations in northern ireland it is a useful building block which can be built on
8357508 to create a situation whereby those who did not traditionally go to see our parades would do so
8357509 to try to convince groups that we were genuine in our attempts to seek a long term solution to the parades issue
8357510 clear and unequivocal condemnation of attacks on orange halls and i would like it to be equally clear that i condemn attacks on roman catholic buildings
8357511 attacks on orange halls and other buildings representing one or other community would be widely regarded as attacks on the whole community
8357512 before the innocent children women and men you massacred to do the right thing before god i appeal to your hearts and human dignity give yourselves up to justice in this world before you face judgement in the next
8357513 have a duty before god to give that information immediately to the police
8357514 the family have never got over it the fact that there has been no conviction in connection with the bombing is only prolonging their agony
8357515 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8357516 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8357517 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8357518 it is not a reprimand a sabbatical year should not be considered a reprimand
8357519 it is just a guess that cpajs activities led to father chuns sabbatical year were he being reprimanded he would have been suspended
8357520 this regulation has exceptions and some parish priests have been transferred even after six months
8357521 i am not in the position to know that but i believe that the decision was drawn from his meeting with cardinal cheong
8357522 i have a sabbatical year that i do not want the right to transfer me belongs to the archbishop i take it as his encouragement to work more actively for the cpaj
8357523 church hierarchy might have felt uneasy with the cpaj as they do not want conflict with political powers
8357524 we cannot keep our mouths shut when it extinguishes the light and acts against its professed mission to be the light and salt
8357525 sincerely reflect to see if they are extinguishing the lamp
8357526 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8357527 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8357528 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8357529 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8357530 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8357531 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8357532 ultimately it gets down to self acceptance if you accept yourself you dont give a damn what anyone else thinks
8357533 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8357534 when sea lions are acutely affected we can sometimes treat them and release them but when it becomes a chronic case it means their brains have been permanently damaged and it causes continuing seizures
8357535 as holds true for men declines in the propensity of workers to obtain coverage for themselves or their spouses through employment has been the major factor leading to declines in coverage since 1980
8357536 as the cost of coverage rises relative to incomes policy makers will need to assist workers to help them afford private insurance coverage
8357537 while u s home value indexes continued to decline an encouraging sign has been the significant moderation in the rate of decline of the purchase only series
8357538 after falling sharply over the prior two quarters more than a 10 percent annualized drop home value depreciation slowed substantially to only a 0
8357539 another good sign was that home values in some parts of the u s have remained stable or edged up most areas in the west south central region arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas experienced price gains over the quarter and the past year
8357540 the motel room basically was set up for surgery to take place
8357541 i wish there was a way to make it up to you
8357542 there is no greater example of how devastating it can be as seen when disaster strikes and an entire community is without homes

8357546 global vision enables collaboration among more than 60 sites across the company linking our 70 000 employee technical community internally and with partners and customers to develop the type of solutions needed to address 21st century global security challenges
8357547 the technology architecture we have built to support global vision is essential to developing the highly integrated and complex technical solutions we must deliver to our customers and therefore is critical to our collaboration needs now and in the future
8357548 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8357549 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8357550 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8357551 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8357552 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8357553 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8357554 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8357555 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8357556 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8357557 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8357558 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8357559 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8357560 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8357561 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8357562 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8357563 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8357564 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8357565 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8357566 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8357567 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8357568 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8357569 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8357570 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8357571 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8357572 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8357573 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8357574 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8357575 i ride because it saves time and money it gets me outside it allows me to eat like a hog and its fun as well
8357576 riding a bike to work may not make sense for everyone but it works for me and im glad i gave it a shot
8357577 he needed that hoh because nothing else has happened to him
8357578 world of warcraft is designed as a pc game its designed to have a keyboard and a mouse so the controls and the control scheme that you have are very pc centric if you think about mapping those controls and all those different type of buttons that you have to a console without a keyboard for chatting its a very challenging proposition
8357579 i mean we love console games also and im sure there will be a successful mmo sometime on a console so it has nothing to do with that its just more like a square peg round hole thing for our game it just wasnt designed with that in mind
8357580 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
8357581 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
8357582 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
8357583 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8357584 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today

8357588 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8357589 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8357590 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8357591 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8357592 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8357593 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8357616 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
8357617 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

8357621 we do believe gustav is going to emerge into the gulf as a major hurricane category 3 or better

8357623 whether or not it can produce the same amount of damage as katrina or rita remains to be seen
8357624 i expect somewhere near 85 percent of the gulf energy infrastructure will be shut in along with a significant increase in damage potential

8357640 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it here from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here we have what appears to be knowingly committed mortgage fraud
8357641 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8357642 people generally do not commit real estate or mortgage fraud for the sheer joy of ripping off the system although in lindsey hunters case with all the benefits he receives by virtue of playing in the nba if he did it then that would appear to be the primary motivation
8357643 by employing private market principles and expanding accountability at all levels of the health system we can contain costs and improve quality of life
8357644 affordable coverage for small businesses must be at the center of health care reform

8357655 investors are waiting to put in a large amount of money towards the digitisation of cable distribution platform in several key cities but there is practically no forward movement on the cas rollout that will mandatorily enforce the digitisation of the cable companies
8357656 the matter requires consultation with all the parties including the various state governments hence it is bound to take time
8357657 but there is no announcement to this affect so far from the ministry
8357658 even the broadcast tribunal tdsat in its recent order had asked the i amp b ministry to issue clear instructions to the broadcasters asking them to share their channels with hits operators we are waiting to hear from the i amp b ministry
8357659 several leading broadcasters have made public announcements of launching their news channels including the national geographic channel discovery india and several news and entertainment channels but even after filing the necessary application with the i amp b ministry there is a considerable amount of delay in issuing the new licences

8357665 there was no reason to believe we were going to pop out another song that did that we were much more concerned with doing an album that we thought was really good
8357666 it was so genuine i almost didnt realize i was doing so it was an out of body experience
8357667 it was a bit of comic relief for something that would be considered serious otherwise

8357673 the overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem
8357674 a replica is not the same thing as the original
8357675 the cracks continue to grow and i cant predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument
8357676 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8357677 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8357678 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8357679 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8357680 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience

8357690 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

8357693 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in love is the only rational act
8357694 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8357695 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8357696 the task of being a poet is not completed at a fixed schedule no one is a poet from eight to twelve and from two to six whoever is a poet is one always and continually assaulted by poetry i suppose a painter feels that colors and shapes are besieging him or a musician feel that the strange world of sounds the strangest world of art is always seeking him out that there are melodies and dissonances looking for him
8357697 i am very sad because we dont have any idea where we are going next
8357698 si tuvi ramos una industria de verdad como la americana las cosas ser an muy diferentes
8357699 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them i want to be like that
8357700 everyone from a senator can enjoy it to a bum on the street its available to everyone
8357701 were making more art for the people rather than the super high end stuff
8357702 they dont wear corporate logos for anybody theyre going to endorse obama the way they want
8357703 everyone wants to use their own voice to endorse obama
8357704 myspace making the web 2 0 looklike the web from 1996 myspace has gotten better but it is still downright ugly clunky and mostly a walled garden i dont like and no recent usage hasnt endeared me to it
8357705 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8357706 we recognize his responsibilities in california and well certainly work with him regarding scheduling should that issue arise
8357707 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8357708 after my father was unable to listen to the beatles
8357709 its a nice story in this case much nicer than the truth
8357710 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8357711 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8357712 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8357713 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8357714 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8357715 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8357716 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8357717 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8357718 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8357719 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8357720 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8357721 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8357722 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8357723 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8357724 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8357725 he port of hamburg setting for this project is not only spectacular but also industrial urban
8357726 here we are starting something quite new and innovative i can hardly wait to take the plunge there at last
8357727 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8357728 despite all of the obstacles and the conscientious objections the service is working
8357729 doctors nurses and social workers have lived up to the commitment with a lot of generosity
8357730 we have the right to choose about our body but we dont have the right to end the life of a human being
8357731 they are not thinking about the psychological damage that the girls who have abortions go through
8357732 would be a historic ruling that recognizes the importance of this problem from the point of view of public health and womens rights
8357733 cuba permits abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy as does the united states
8357734 my mom went to the er yesterday she had stomach pain that was getting worse so my dad took her in ended up being a kidney stone and all is fine now but heres the interesting part the hospital as of the beginning of this year orders ekgs on all women presenting with stomach pain they said that so much research has shown that this kind of pain may signify a heart attack in women
8357735 we are very thankful to have the generous support of duane reade
8357736 in 2008 more than 170 000 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 000 will die we appreciate duane reades commitment to helping us run breast cancer out of town the companys pinup program will allow us to fund even more local breast health education screening and treatment programs next year and the pink shopping bags will be a tangible and lasting sign of new yorks support
8357737 as an integral part of the new york community we are proud to play such a large role in the 2008 komen new york city race for the cure
8357738 duane reade is the local presenting sponsor of the race and by selling the komen ribbon pinups in our stores and turning our iconic shopping bags pink we invite new yorkers to show their support and help us contribute to the effort to find a cure for breast cancer
8357739 vivisimo continues at the forefront of creating strategies and products to help organizations manage and profit by the massive amounts of data they are creating and storing
8357740 we help our customers maximize the business value of their information by using sophisticated search and discovery to drive collaboration and innovation throughout their organizations
8357741 by employing private market principles and expanding accountability at all levels of the health system we can contain costs and improve quality of life
8357742 affordable coverage for small businesses must be at the center of health care reform
8357743 we have offered a reform plan that would not only make coverage more affordable for small businesses but would also make it easier for their employees to accept coverage when it is offered
8357744 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8357745 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8357746 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8357747 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8357748 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8357749 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8357750 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8357751 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8357752 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8357753 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8357754 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8357755 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8357756 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8357757 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8357758 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8357759 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8357760 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8357761 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8357762 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8357763 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8357764 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8357765 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8357766 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8357767 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8357768 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8357769 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8357770 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8357771 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8357772 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8357773 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8357774 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was

8357783 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8357784 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

8357807 we still have a lot of work to do to be ready for the season
8357808 but we are just going to take it one day at a time
8357809 it is a great opportunity to spend time with the team
8357810 its five days of focus on volleyball and team dynamics
8357811 with such strong middles we have the luxury of moving lori to the right side and getting her a lot more balls
8357812 she adds a whole other dimension to the team she is a huge blocking force
8357813 both girls are working really hard and challenging each other
8357814 we are way ahead of last year and on target to be prepared once the season starts
8357815 we are ready for the season and really determined to be the best in the conference
8357816 it will hopefully speed things up at the reserved desk for the undergrads
8357817 its like every day theres a basketball in the clock room that we have to sign so im used to it
8357818 i love the muss i love the excitement of the new season im really excited for football and the new cheerleader uniforms
8357819 that was the best turnout since ive been here thats for sure
8357820 the fans like to interact with the athletes and come see the people they watch at a personal level
8357821 our schedule is very difficult but were trying to establish a program here i think you have to do that by playing good teams
8357822 were trying to walk that fine line between maybe not too difficult a schedule but good enough to get us in ncaa tournament
8357823 the television schedule represents the respect our program has earned
8357824 it gives us great exposure which continues to be of great importance on the national scene
8357825 this is a big loss for our team and very difficult for stephanie
8357826 her unique style of gymnastics made her a crowd favorite and she was a valuable contributor for the past two years
8357827 all the fans are coming up to me all my teammates and family i just have everyone behind me right now
8357828 i know that its the best decision but its just a hard one to make
8357829 gymnastics is my life so now im like all right now what am i going to do
8357830 we got a lot of work done on the offensive and defensive side of the football
8357831 you look at a guy like reed who caught a junior college record 111 balls last year thats quite an addition
8357832 chris joppru was the most improved football player in our camp
8357833 also there was jones on the defensive side of the ball
8357834 we are still deliberating whether or not to redshirt shak
8357835 we feel a player is usually always better in his second season with the program but thats not always the case
8357836 but on the other side of the coin so have they
8357837 i believe our team is very mature and i expect us to be just fine
8357838 we had an overtime game on friday and i feel like we started to run out of gas
8357839 but we were able to hang in there and keep them off the scoreboard after the first half
8357840 were still trying to find out roles on the team
8357841 were working on formations and finding out who can help us at what spots
8357842 katie made a great play in overtime to win it for us
8357843 we have a lot of talented attacking players and kelly is a central player to our offense
8357844 along with the freshmen we have six sophomores and a lot of players who havent gotten a lot of playing time in the past
8357845 for a young team we handled this kind of road trip with good composure
8357846 sunday was a great example of when things arent going well we hung in there
8357847 i think our will power allowed us to do that
8357848 we have strength of character that can bend but not break both teams tested us and we didnt break
8357849 we stayed composed under a lot of pressure which was great
8357850 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8357851 i dont question their motives i believe they have the best interests of the students in mind
8357852 lowering the drinking age is unlikely to have the salutary benefits they desire the illicit factor of illegal drinking is only a small part of the problem the larger problem is that it is unregulated
8357853 the problem with carrying open is someone wanting to take your weapon away from you
8357854 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere

8357866 shes a girl with long long long legs skinny and very pretty
8357867 what kind of description and introduction is that long legs
8357868 if you knew so many years ago that your daughter would one day lead to you having lived with more than five hundred hamsters a rabbit and five cats you wouldnt have me right
8357869 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8357870 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8357871 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8357872 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8357873 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8357874 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8357875 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8357876 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8357877 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8357878 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8357879 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8357880 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug
8357881 quite frankly i wish it were the other way around
8357882 now that hillary is not there i hope the whole city gets behind obama and biden i think they will

8357896 its the first game of a 10 game schedule and its no different than any other game
8357897 weve got to get this bad taste out of our mouths the seniors are champing at the bit its a chance to play for real
8357898 we want to be a team that can run it and throw it
8357899 i dont put a lot of stock in national polls
8357900 kevin jankunas is running pretty well compared to where he was last year
8357901 his brother did the same thing he had a big jump between his sophomore and junior years
8357902 everybody is looking to see who guy is to get everyone going
8357903 theyll be one of the bigger teams well line up against
8357904 its not a book that tells you how to do everything
8357905 everyone used to say shirley why dont you write a book about your life
8357906 theyre people who have had successes and failures picked themselves up and had success again
8357907 its that idea that youre going to have failures along the way
8357908 its setting the vision and communicating that to your franchisees employees or clients and working hard to make it come to life
8357909 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8357910 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8357911 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8357912 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8357913 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8357914 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8357915 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8357916 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8357917 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8357918 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8357919 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8357920 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8357921 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8357922 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8357923 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8357924 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8357925 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8357926 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8357927 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8357928 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8357929 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8357930 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8357931 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8357932 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8357933 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8357934 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8357935 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8357936 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8357937 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8357938 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8357939 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8357940 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8357941 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8357942 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8357943 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8357944 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8357945 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8357946 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8357947 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8357948 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8357949 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8357950 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8357951 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8357952 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8357953 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8357954 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8357955 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8357956 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8357957 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8357958 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8357959 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8357960 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8357961 koan el problema parad jico para la meditaci n es creado para quebrar el intelecto todo esto s lo tiene valor como un medio para aclarar la senda para la intuici n est ideado s lo para ayudar a abrir la puerta desde dentro
8357962 este es el motivo por el cual aparece la paradoja en situaciones como la de los ejercicios zen en los que justamente deber a aprenderse a saltar a un plano cognoscitivo superior para poder observar en este nuevo plano sus pensamientos y conceptos valorativos en forma imparcial mientras el que aprende se mantenga atado a uno u otro plano a una predilecci n o juicio a lo bueno o lo malo lo positivo o lo negativo a lo espiritual o lo mundano la meta de la ense anza no se habr alcanzado un buen maestro es aquel que puede transmitir v vidamente la reflexividad y lo entreverado de la situaci n hasta que el estudiante se vea obligado a extraerse de ella

8357976 i have worked in the human resources field for 30 years and have never before encountered an hr professional of the same caliber as loretta harper
8357977 loretta harper has transformed human resources at the university in myriad ways that have significantly improved our work environment and our benefits
8357978 the highlights of my career have been to provide leadership in a manner that allows others to succeed and reach their full potential
8357979 her work days are not limited to the standard work unpredictable and busy
8357980 under harpers guidance and direction human resources has taken giant steps forward in virtually every area
8357981 she will be deeply missed by all of us who have had the privilege of working with her
8357982 the new pipes are six inches pre insulated wrapped around with another steel pipe and then coated with a very thick polymer material
8357983 its supposed to last 40 years so we hope to never see the pipe again
8357984 the supply and return of the water runs at different temperatures and can cause it to corrode faster
8357985 when you have that high of pressure it is kept liquid but if it hits the surface it immediately turns to steam and can be quite volatile
8357986 the pipe has two actual barriers to keep out any corrosion
8357987 most people have been pretty good but a few people seem to have a death wish
8357988 were hoping to have a bridge for students to walk across but existing utility work is posing a problem
8357989 well finish as much as we can before snow falls and then finish the rest in spring
8357990 the idea for the research comes mostly out of the need to understand what the electron spins in semi conductors do
8357991 what researchers have learned is that the spin sometimes slips around by itself
8357992 if you have random spin flips the oscillation of the current goes up and down
8357993 at the moment were working on aspects of the device and making samples
8357994 later were going to do a really systematic study of different parameters and different physical properties that can alter spin flipping like temperature or combining different materials
8357995 this is not as straightforward as people thought in the past
8357996 only one can produce light and the other three produce heat
8357997 if due to a spin flip they can all go into a state that produces light they will produce more energy
8357998 this study is related to the question how much light can you get out of an organic polymer material
8357999 often imitated copied pasted and stolen from but never duplicated
8358000 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8358001 we recognize his responsibilities in california and well certainly work with him regarding scheduling should that issue arise
8358002 i thought my olympics were over for sure but at that time i almost did not care i was just freaking out because i had no idea what was happening with my body
8358003 the crowds cheered and i remember telling myself ok the worst is over you have three kilometers to go you can do this you can finish you dont have to fail
8358004 i looked to the stadium it was right there i was next to it i saw the olympic flame only i did not know if i was going to make it inside of it
8358005 my body gave up on me but upset as i am right now i think i will with time look back at this experience as perfect too
8358006 i never had to overcome myself like this before the time may not reflect my fitness and ability but it is an official olympic time
8358007 blogging has given me a way to reflect on my experience as i am experiencing it
8358008 it really is wonderful to be able to share this experience with people i care about and who care about me reading their comments or posting something they may find interesting gives me something to look forward to each day i just try to include in my blog a little bit of everything so that everyone can find something interesting to read i am sure a lot of people dont care about my analysis of a particular workout but that is important to me and i know my running friends probably enjoy following that aspect of my experience
8358009 about every few hundred yards if you look hard enough you see people with brooms
8358010 the sidewalks seem completely clean so it just seems a little needless to continue sweeping them and most people who do this seem at quite a different place as they are doing it
8358011 feels kind of like being at a huge conference of something such as teachers of english to speakers of other languages people with badges everywhere only a lot more security
8358012 the focus right now is on getting as much rest as possible
8358013 with marathons the hardest training happens up to three weeks before the race at this time its just fine tuning
8358014 for the managers the pressure is mostly finished when the games start
8358015 the high pressure comes in the year leading up to it
8358016 i am well aware that i will not be winning a medal
8358017 i will be competing against over a hundred of best women from around the world most of whom are professional runners who do not have other jobs let alone work on their doctoral degrees
8358018 the effect of music and fine arts on a whole range of other aspects of childrens lives is tremendously important
8358019 as fine arts are enhanced and developed in our public education you see absenteeism go down you see performance and behavioral problems reduced as well as substantial and demonstrable increases in performance in mathematics in science and in languages the relationship between the arts and these other critical skills is just absolutely clear
8358020 its like a miracle the support we have been getting from the university is like a dream come true
8358021 we are honored our efforts will continue beverley sorensens work and carry her name
8358022 the combination of how to teach and what to teach in the arts is a prospect about which we are extraordinarily excited
8358023 as a family we are touched by the problems that we face in many of our less affluent communities where gangs and other attractions seem to want to steal our youth
8358024 we see this as a great tool in the arsenal against these kinds of destructive things
8358025 fear of isolation communication apprehension future opinion congruency and communication setting significantly predict willingness to speak out
8358026 these results suggest that individuals who are high in neuroticism characterized by anxiety worry emotional reactivity and nervousness may blog to assuage loneliness or in an attempt to reach out and form social connections with others
8358027 ive always thought prick applied to people who resorted to such name calling in lieu of argument
8358028 the internet has a mob mentality that can overwhelm serious criticism
8358029 there is superb writing in blogs and discussion groups but there are also thousands of semi literate tirades
8358030 smoking is the single greatest avoidable cause of disease and death
8358031 mining processing and waste disposal require land to be withdrawn from traditional uses such as agriculture residential areas or recreation

8358034 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica

8358038 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8358039 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8358044 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8358045 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8358046 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8358047 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8358048 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8358049 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8358050 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8358051 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8358052 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8358053 quando sono state appiccate le fiamme i bambini non si trovavano nelledificio solo la donna si trovava in una delle due camere incendiate ed rimasta ustionata nel tentativo di scappare

8358055 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8358056 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8358057 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8358058 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8358059 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8358060 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8358061 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8358062 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi

8358074 in the deep ocean there is a strong interaction between viruses and prokaryotes which helps sustain the deep sea ecosystems independently of the nutrient inputs coming from the surface waters
8358075 its a sort of self sustaining mechanism helping the ocean depths to overcome severe nutrient limitations

8358080 barack obama is uniquely qualified to be president his history makes him perfectly prepared for this job if you look at his record of accomplishment in the senate you will have a preview of what he can do in the white house
8358081 i like to maintain tradition and show people how it was done
8358082 our country wasnt started with tractors our grandfathers put a lot of sweat in this land
8358083 all the players bought into it we met that goal which was quite cool
8358084 we knew wed be playing teams better than wed been playing all year we knew it would be a challenge
8358085 we were matched with two great teams right off the bat
8358086 i raced the last two weekends so i knew i was going to be a bit tired and i was so i just wanted to run those two times and i did
8358087 weve had 35 plus years of canadas finest athletes moving through that program on the way up
8358088 and any time you can take any record at that age group that says something about your potential for the future
8358089 i was smiling for the next three days i couldnt get it off my face
8358090 if you can compete against people older than you then the olympics and all that stuff come into mind
8358091 i want to go to the olympics thats my goal for sure and i want to go there and bring medals home for canada
8358092 it was nerve wracking i was shaking most of the time i was there
8358093 everythings heightened by like 10 times compared to here people in europe pack the stands for track and field its like hockey to them
8358094 the only difference was there was a lot more swearing and my aunty actually did take her shirt off
8358095 it feels good to know that the items i sell are not only well designed but also fair trade organic and sustainable to know this gives me a purpose
8358096 from out back to out on the town this jacket is a must have transitional basic

8358100 what does senator clinton have to do with obamas speech
8358101 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8358102 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8358103 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8358104 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8358105 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8358106 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8358107 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8358108 keep our kids studying at home and the rest of the brits away
8358109 undergraduate degrees will be free for scottish students at universities in scotland but students from england and wales will pay 1 700 a year to study in scotland or 2 700 for medical courses
8358110 if the scottish education system has always been distinct from the rest of the uk there is now a gulf between the experience of students in england and scotland
8358111 the scottish decision on tuition fees however has inflamed a row that is likely to intensify to screaming pitch in the years ahead
8358112 salmond warned on lecture hall discrimination experts warned that unequal treatment of students could lead to court challenges
8358113 the move will fuel mounting anger that people in scotland enjoy more generous public services largely funded by english taxpayers
8358114 it further highlights the imbalance between the system in disparate parts of the uk its a discriminatory regime
8358115 the commission for racial equality said treating students differently could cause problems
8358116 widening access to education is a positive initiative but it is important to ensure it does not create inconsistencies or inequalities
8358117 the scottish executive is not allowed to discriminate against other eu states but can with perfect equanimity discriminate against students from within an eu state in this case the uk
8358118 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8358119 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

8358121 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8358122 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8358123 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8358124 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8358125 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8358126 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8358127 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8358128 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8358129 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8358130 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8358131 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8358132 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

8358135 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8358136 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8358137 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8358138 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties
8358139 halo models are nice theyre a benefit but these are not ordinary times for chrysler or for gm or ford during these times these mass market companies have to become as efficient as possible
8358140 while this is a strategic review our intent would be to offer strong operational and financial support during any potential transaction in order to ensure a future for the viper business and perpetuate the legacy of this great vehicle
8358141 pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
8358142 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8358143 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8358144 as tokahe y sus amigos fueron el primer pueblo del mundo y sus hijos son los lakotas

8358148 i was thinking aloud and fell out of touch but im back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
8358149 celebrations in the white sox locker room high fives in the press box
8358150 i am not selecting people that just didnt like marriotti i am talking about this as a professional matter as someone who could undermine so much that cant even believe it
8358151 celebrations in the white sox locker room high fives in the press box
8358152 i think on trax it wont be as big of an issue
8358153 but if i was still taking the bus i think that would be a bigger problem
8358154 they may give you a bit of grief or make you pay
8358155 for right now this is the only thing we can do to alleviate the delay
8358156 i guess we didnt take into account the olympics when we ordered them
8358157 theres not much we can do about that right now
8358158 everyone pays in their tuition a transportation fee and this is what its going to
8358159 i ride trax every day and if i had to walk to school it would not be cool so i think its a good use of our tuition
8358160 if people are going to ride trax without paying they are going to find a way to do it
8358161 im not sure if this will prevent people from taking a free ride but it will help improve the situation
8358162 do you know of any other bars restaurants or shops which will be mia this labor day weekend
8358163 thats going to happen every year to us cause we cant take the chance of losing games due to weather that early
8358164 those first three weeks of the year were always going to travel
8358165 the thing that i am really anxious about is that were going to have much more depth than we had last year
8358166 it has the potential to really strengthen media at the u im pleased to have the opportunity to help draft the new bylaws
8358167 the merger of the two councils will allow us to expand media production opportunities for students while still allowing for everyone to retain their independence and autonomy
8358168 however i am concerned about the role that the assistant publisher will play the duties of this position arent clearly stated in the report but i can see this figure becoming a potential threat to the chronicles independence it all depends on how the new bylaws are written
8358169 i can understand their desire to consolidate but some of the positions are worrisome because the minute you have administrator oversight you lose the freedom of press that the chronicle and other student publications have always enjoyed
8358170 its important that students figure that out and get a chance to practice it
8358171 arthritis cancer and lots of things can affect hepcidin levels
8358172 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
8358173 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
8358174 its not ready yet but as soon as we have it it can be used for so many different things
8358175 it is my intent to work with all parties to create a higher education governance system based on collaboration and innovation
8358176 i look forward to working with the regents the governor the legislature and each educational institution to build a positive agenda for strengthening utah
8358177 president sederburgs leadership in education public policy and the community make him uniquely qualified to serve as the next commissioner of higher education
8358178 he has been in the legislature and understands that process which is tremendously important with him coming in it creates a champion for higher education
8358179 he has provided strong clear leadership for uvu and i expect that he will bring these skills to the role of commissioner
8358180 he understands that the university of utah is a very important part of the utah system of higher education and i believe that he will consult with us on key issues important to the u
8358181 the siciliano forum is on the status of american society and what we have been doing is trying to tackle the intractable questions facing us
8358182 for example and this is not any sort of political statement all of the arguing that we are seeing about what laws should apply to our detainees at guantanamo
8358183 lee hamilton despite his real sophistication and knowledge is very understandable to a layperson
8358184 i hope the forum audience and the world at large will see their intellectual horizons widened on two issues
8358185 those are one a better understanding of the middle east as the key crisis point in the 21st century and two the effective power of non violence
8358186 i want people to think about whether or not we need to re articulate the limits of self defense in the context of the post 9 11 world
8358187 another question i would like people to ask themselves is this if we do need to re articulate self defense does that mean we also need to re articulate international law
8358188 there is plenty of money at this convention enough to make the difference in say twenty close congressional races
8358189 the left is dead i interviewed the head of the communist party and it only has 312 members its all of america vs right wing cranks
8358190 its not left versus right because left positions like universal healthcare global warming are now mainstream positions the problem is with the media which presents all sides when often there is only one side
8358191 to harness all the energy out there you have to deal with what pisses people off deregulation and nafta which both parties are responsible for have made ordinary people angry you have to force the party to take progressive positions
8358192 instead of targeting the swing voters he should target the unlikely voters
8358193 this is my first time ever wearing them but i like em
8358194 feels great to wear them and have my name on the back were going to see how everything works out this year with this new jersey
8358195 the museums job is to educate people about the natural world and trail users are certainly key to that
8358196 i have friends who ride through there on their way to work and rerouting will make it longer and less enjoyable
8358197 if we had more classrooms or learning space we would be able to serve a lot of the public schools
8358198 right now we turn groups away because we just dont have the room for them
8358199 i think it will definitely be overcrowded and kind of a hassle
8358200 id probably find a new trail if it gets really bad
8358201 but that road is pretty narrow so it definitely creates a safety issue
8358202 i think if they do a good job of reconstructing the trail and clean up after themselves thats fine
8358203 id rather have the trail open and the museum on both sides than not open at all
8358204 there is already a tension between walkers runners and bikers and i think that will probably just increase
8358205 this community has grown enormously since we opened in 1969 and we havent been able to grow with it
8358206 we only have 24 000 square feet of exhibit space and its just not big enough for what people ask us to show
8358207 were just trying to improve what we do make it better and more accurate
8358208 we just refined the procedure that was already in place
8358209 its still not going to catch the type of people that have money that can buy the designer drugs and are using the more sophisticated types of drugs that are now available to the wealthy
8358210 the people taking steroids will still be taking steroids and theyll still be able to mask what they are taking and thats one of the problems we have with steroid use
8358211 we are not aware of any cases where an athlete was falsely accused of steroid use and there is significant due process to ensure that this does not happen
8358212 the people taking the drugs are far advanced than the people testing the drugs because the protocols and so forth for the testing are very strict and they have to be proved and so forth
8358213 and the people not only making masking agents but also the ones that are providing the designer drugs are ahead of people that are doing the testing
8358214 it was costing us money to get rid of the empty space caused by boxes that werent broken down
8358215 it was realized there was a need for recycling cardboard
8358216 we came up with a plan to take the cardboard from the waste stream
8358217 the system works pretty well but i get chased around a lot
8358218 loading cardboard isnt an easy job before i just tossed cardboard in a bin but now it takes a lot of work
8358219 it is interesting how each department functions on its own accord
8358220 there are a lot of resources that others arent aware of simply because it isnt required of them to know
8358221 the number of pizza boxes that come in is ridiculous
8358222 we can only accept clean cardboard and only cardboard just like the sign says
8358223 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral
8358224 primarily reflects melt in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8358225 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances
8358226 the arctic is gigantic when you have nine bears sighted in one transect route one can assume that there are likely a lot more bears swimming in open water

8358229 between now and november i predict that the oil companies will hold out on oil prices a little bit
8358230 you know to try to get the republicans the ticket
8358231 im afraid that by the time january comes along the economy will be the most serious problem in america
8358232 the reasons why the price of oil has come down is because i spent 5 yrs in a communist prison cell i didnt have a car
8358233 maybe we did need someone with more experience than a speech in 2002 to run this nation
8358234 accusing john mccain of being in the pocket of big oil has been a consistent line of attack from democrats in the past few months
8358235 the fact that the republicans are in the pocket of big oil has provided the democrats with good ammunition
8358236 we cant drill our way out of this mess even if we drill in all of mccains backyards including the ones he doesnt remember he has
8358237 my whole background has really been in program development and taking on initiatives like service so i dont see myself taking on a significant policy role
8358238 i think i think that if i could be a voice around a set of issues work family balance making sure that were aware of the challenges that families are facing in this economy i think thats the role that i can play
8358239 i joke that my first job is going to be mommy because with little kids you know i have to make sure that their feet are on the ground thats going to be an important priority as it has been during the course of this campaign
8358240 ive been having conversations with military spouses all around the country
8358241 hearing their stories the amount of mental stress that theyre under without any support not being able to hold down jobs because they are moving from place to place to place and i was surprised at the challenges they face and i know that if more americans heard those stories we would get some more attention and some more support for initiatives that are designed to help these families
8358242 politics is kind of like a family you fight and make up
8358243 no one elected her president how dare she see this is why you should hate her
8358244 not better then hillary i love hillary and i will never vote for obama because he had been unfair with hillary
8358245 the investors chief problem and even his worst enemy is likely to be himself we have seen much more money made and kept emphasis his by ordinary people who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance accounting and stock market lore
8358246 we accepted that there was risk looked for opportunity and exploited it to our advantage

8358264 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm

8358267 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8358268 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8358269 the planes pilot has indicated that the hijackers who number 10 or maybe more have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8358270 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8358271 the hijackers refuse to free any passengers or even open the doors which have remained closed since the plane landed

8358275 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
8358276 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it here from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here we have what appears to be knowingly committed mortgage fraud
8358277 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8358278 people generally do not commit real estate or mortgage fraud for the sheer joy of ripping off the system although in lindsey hunters case with all the benefits he receives by virtue of playing in the nba if he did it then that would appear to be the primary motivation
8358279 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8358280 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play

8358284 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field

8358307 we always have more calls and e mails from kids and parents interested in swimming after an olympics
8358308 but theres been a lot more than usual in the past couple of weeks probably because of phelps its the same with the other coaches ive talked to
8358309 its great to see more kids and families getting into the sport how many of them will stay with it is the big question
8358310 the question we always ask beginning swimmers and families is are they ready to make the time commitment
8358311 it doesnt matter if youre with a united states swimming affiliated club like us the dolphins or at one of the area y teams
8358312 you have to be ready to put in the time
8358313 august is usually the only down period we have during the year
8358314 our big meets are done for the season we begin to gear back up in september so its almost a year round activity
8358315 the goal of the raiders or other swim clubs is specifically to develop swimmers to the highest level of national and international competition
8358316 so the training is going to be very intense and the competition at meets very deep
8358317 ive worked for some ys and the emphasis is on overall family fun and fitness there are plenty of very competitive y programs right around here like beavercreek south dayton or countryside in lebanon you get to the nationals and there are y teams which are tougher than a lot of club teams

8358320 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8358321 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8358322 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8358323 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8358324 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8358325 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8358326 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8358327 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8358328 quite frankly i wish it were the other way around
8358329 now that hillary is not there i hope the whole city gets behind obama and biden i think they will

8358405 at the moment there are between 10 000 and 11 000 palestinian prisoners languishing in various israeli jails this is a figure that has remained consistently high since the beginning of the israeli occupation 41 years ago the total number of palestinians to have spent time in israeli prison is estimated at 700 000 roughly one fifth of the current palestinian population of the occupied territories

8358413 in march 2009 russia is likely to deploy modern s 300 long range anti aircraft missiles in iran
8358414 by june 2009 they will become fully operational as iranian teams finish training provided by their russian instructors according to a high level russian source who requested anonymity
8358415 the s 300 system which has a radius of over 90 miles and effective altitudes of about 90 000 feet is capable of tracking up to 100 targets simultaneously
8358416 it is considered one of the best in the world and is amazingly versatile it is capable of shooting down aircraft cruise missiles and ballistic missile warheads
8358417 the deployment of the anti aircraft shield next spring if it occurs effectively limits the window in which israel or the united states could conduct an effective aerial campaign aimed at destroying delaying or crippling the iranian nuclear program
8358418 the islamic republic will use the long range anti aircraft system in addition to the point defense tor m 1 short range russian made system to protect its nuclear infrastructure including suspected nuclear weapons facilities from a potential u s or israeli preventive strike
8358419 however a mission over iran if and when decided upon is very different than operations over neighboring syria
8358420 first if israel waits until march 2009 there may be a president in the white house who emphasizes diplomacy over military operations even if the george w bush administration allows israel overflight of iraqi airspace and aerial refueling a future administration might not opting for an aggressive diplomacy approach instead especially with an emboldened and truculent russia as a geopolitical counter balance
8358421 many of the iranian targets are fortified and will require bunker busters
8358422 operational challenges abound israels ew planes needed to suppress anti aircraft batteries are slow and unarmed and could become a target for iranian anti aircraft missiles or even fighter sorties
8358423 but the most important question analysts are asking is whether the current israeli leadership has the knowledge and the gumption to pull it off

8358425 media outlets reported allegations biden plagiarized kinnock but not that he had previously credited him
8358426 quit the 1988 presidential race in the face of accusations that he had plagiarized part of a speech from neil kinnock the british labor party leader at the time
8358427 shortly afterward he was found to have suffered two aneurysms
8358428 biden also will have his 1988 presidential campaign and the charges of plagiarism that drove him from the race resurrected at least in these opening days as he is introduced as obamas running mate but that experience is long in the past and probably does not present a significant problem

8358479 mr biden i want to know if you believe yourself to be in the pocket of the riaa and other big media lobbyists who are obviously not on the side of the consumer the riaa obviously has no consideration for the rights privacy and general well being of their own consumers and seem only interested in slowing down the natural progression of their own industry in an effort to increase their bottom line also how much are they paying you
8358480 what are your views on digital rights management and copyright law what rights do you believe consumers should have with products they own
8358481 with the furor over the impending rate hike for internet radio stations wouldnt a good solution be for streaming internet stations to simply not play riaa affiliated labels music and focus on independent artists

8358497 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8358498 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8358499 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8358500 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8358501 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8358502 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8358503 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8358504 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8358505 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8358506 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8358507 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8358508 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8358528 militares rusos encontraron hoy en un veh culo que pertenec a al estado mayor georgiano el plan de la operaci n militar lanzada contra osetia del sur inform un portavoz del ministerio de defensa de rusia

8358532 pienso que ahora en georgia rusia y el resto del mundo qued claro que la aspiraci n de georgia de ingresar en la otan no es para formar parte de un sistema de seguridad internacional sino para arrastrar a otros pa ses a ser c mplices de sus planes sangrientos

8358588 there has been an increasing growing distrust in the whole party system though people claim they are supportive of democratic process there is a tendency to say that democracy is great but our democracy in our country is not good
8358589 today i am going to talk to you about liars schemers total rogues and politicians oh im sorry im simply repeating myself arent i
8358590 there have been a lot of politicians that have not been honest in what they have claimed
8358591 the purpose of this undertaking is to create a global educational experience that brings together a few of the finest students from two major universities to cover the american political conventions this summer as working journalists
8358592 i am a big believer that when people are energized and engaged in democracy that government and politics works best
8358593 but when people become apathetic special interests are always ready to fill that vacuum and that is when they can cause harm to our community and nation
8358594 obama has a way of rallying college age hype and students have been fed up with iraq and the economy
8358595 abby is a talented athlete and setter with high mobility and great hands
8358596 a lot of teams in utah play the same style of volleyball and its different from what we did in arizona
8358597 ive had to get used to running a different system
8358598 she did an amazing job handling that pressure and improving throughout the year
8358599 connecting with hitters is not easy and they have been handling it well
8358600 we know we are competing but the competition makes everyone better
8358601 each day we just go out there and try and win
8358602 i didnt have anyone to help me last year and it was really hard to get adjusted
8358603 whoever is running the offense the best and is getting the hitters the sets is the one who will get the job
8358604 it is scary to think about because you wake up one day go off to work or school and then by the time you come home you see this mountain on fire
8358605 half of the houses have been evacuated and it is just scary to know what will happen next and if it will be ok
8358606 when fire moves there is a possibility ash could go into someones yard or roof if there is anything at all that could burn it will
8358607 we have about 160 people out there today 140 are out on the mountain working on containment or working with the helicopter
8358608 also there are about 120 involving united fire authority engines we still have structure protection engines as a precaution
8358609 our role has been to protect the homes they actually saved a few homes in big hollow throughout the night while looking for spot fires
8358610 we have not been evacuated however we can see flames from my bedroom window
8358611 whenever theres a gust of wind we can see it flare up
8358612 the fire was only about two miles from my house
8358613 i was not evacuated but i was informed to stay indoors so i wouldnt breathe all that smoke i decided to water the lawn just as a precaution i actually went up the mountain to get closer to where the fire was and it was pretty impressive it was hard to breathe and the flames were right above me
8358614 the only real way that this fire has affected me is that it has made me think about what i would do if south mountain the ridge south of corner canyon caught on fire
8358615 its important for us to have an evacuation plan because if a fire ever starts the whole thing would burn up in an instant putting a lot of people and their homes in jeopardy in a very short time
8358616 they need to be prepared they need to know what they are going to take
8358617 in light of this incident i hope that draper city will take more notice of the amount of dead and dry bushes grass or weeds and will require them to be cut down and removed from residential areas in order to prevent more incidents like what we saw on monday
8358618 the public has been exceptionally good over the past few years about putting out campfires not using fireworks and doing everything that they are supposed to do
8358619 whenever you have wildland that bumps up against what we call the wildland human interface it can increase the firestarts
8358620 i think the building is fantastic but because of delays here we are in the start of the semester and its not complete
8358621 we have faculty now that can talk with their peers it is a much more collegial set up with more library spaces and lots of common public space so students can talk
8358622 near the end of the design plans they asked us to add a fourth floor which we added without an extension to the project timetable
8358623 its one of the few buildings on campus that has gone up as fast as it has
8358624 these guys have been so fabulous theyre there all day long to push everything through
8358625 having to start school today was frustrating but thats one of those circumstances that happens
8358626 we now all have good heating air conditioning and fantastic lobbies
8358627 its good because the overall location is more central on campus and im closer to colleagues in other departments like philosophy and those in lnco and osh
8358628 we had our classrooms all on the upper part of lower campus it was all uphill with my laptop and my bag
8358629 the history department now has nice seminar and conference rooms and its so much easier to park
8358630 parking in the back is much more convenient than the football stadium or heaven forbid parking behind carlson hall
8358631 carlson hall was always very isolated but we used to have closets and lots of space
8358632 the university has to build to certain regulations and carlson hall was built before those regulations
8358633 the new offices are only half the size of our old ones which used to be dorms for women
8358634 but this building is not at all attractive in terms of its shape and the building materials though once you step inside the atrium it is very nice
8358635 a lot of attention was paid to how light works in the building
8358636 there will be tons of natural light with windows from floor to ceiling in all of those public spaces
8358637 barack obama is one of the most exciting candidates weve had certainly in our students lifetime and i think in my lifetime
8358638 hes charismatic hes young hes good looking and he gives the best speeches but i think even beyond all of those things hes run a very populist type of campaign
8358639 it creates this kind of rock star feeling and it gives younger people some empowerment because they see others who are so excited
8358640 its kind of a perfect storm of events and occurrences and circumstances
8358641 of all demographics young people are experiencing probably the greatest impact from the iraq war they are the most progressive on climate change and they really see this as a critical time in terms of the state of the economy with things like student debt college affordability and jobs
8358642 its not just because of his youthfulness although that definitely doesnt hurt
8358643 its more that hes in touch with what young people care about not because hes young but because his policy proposals actually address the issues they care about and the cherry on top is definitely his tactics like his extensive use of the internet and social networking sites he valued young voters earlier on in the campaign and more than any of the other candidates
8358644 the u student population in general seems to be much more interested in this coming election
8358645 and i would say thats mainly due to obama he just sort of has a presence about him that i think appeals to the younger generation a lot im a senior now and the friends i made my freshman year just didnt care anything about politics now if you ask them they are watching everything and keeping track of whats going on
8358646 there has been a steady increase over the years in the number of young people coming out to vote since about 2000 the 2008 election is going to be the pinnacle of that theres been a lot of work put in to build an infrastructure that is ready to support young people turning out at the polls i believe that its really going to happen
8358647 our goal is to show that a lot of young students are in support of john mccain
8358648 since colorado is a swing state we felt we needed to come and help during this convention
8358649 all of the kids here feel that we need to show that john mccain has a grassroots movement that is just as strong actually stronger than obamas
8358650 i was worried that i would be surrounded by a bunch of democrats that wouldnt want us to be here and would be rude and angry
8358651 being surrounded by other republicans who are unified toward a common goal
8358652 we are trying to convert the people on the fence and energize those already on our side
8358653 we are doing mainstream medias job that they havent been doing
8358654 we have got a candidate that has been unexamined we went back and talked to senators folks in chicago to get the full story
8358655 i am not going to tell anyone how to vote but i do think they need to know the truth
8358656 if you want to elect obama elect him with your eyes wide open
8358657 they have been helping us by getting people excited and getting the word out
8358658 i think it is great that they are out here
8358659 it is good to see diversity and students willing to express their differences i think that as they talk to people they will certainly make a difference with voters
8358660 my parents would give me and my brother comic books from the tooth fairy and hide them under our pillows
8358661 a lot of people look at comics and think its really bad wall art
8358662 too often with comic books especially indie pulp and noir comics youll have the hard boiled narration going on the whole time thats overwrought and overdone
8358663 some panels you leave open whereas with some panels you want more detail you want to fill it in more
8358664 its like the whole pixies loud soft loud soft thing its how you create drama
8358665 exercise gives you endorphins endorphins make you happy happy people just dont shoot their husbands
8358666 rub your hands together briskly then lightly press them to your closed eyes with your fingers pointing upward
8358667 visualize comfort emanating from them and let the warmth soothe your eyes
8358668 its all been hot as hell on a run like this
8358669 josh turner makes alan jackson look like a rocker but the fans love him
8358670 there are lots of people its really beautiful here and its just a very relaxing atmosphere
8358671 look out at the crowd and youll see 1 000 american flags in peoples hats its good old fashioned american redneck fun
8358672 its always a good day when you go on leave but its always tinged with a bit of knowing that soon youre going to have to come back
8358673 thats the hard part of it you get home you get back into the groove or the swing of things start to feel like a family again and then you get jerked back away
8358674 you have to get right back into the swing of things as people in charge expect you to do your job
8358675 i know ive got to leave again soon and i use that as impetus to ensure that we take advantage of everyday that we have while were together again
8358676 whether im here in iraq or whether im at home no day is guaranteed to me so thats something that i want to apply to my entire life
8358677 its a hollow sick feeling when you have to leave your loved ones
8358678 when you first leave for a deployment theres almost an excitement because you dont know whats going to happen but when you leave to come back from eml you already know what youre going back into and so the excitements gone
8358679 i was heading home right when a helicopter with other soldiers that were going on leave was shot down they were supposed to go home with me
8358680 i wasnt able to get ahold of my wife or family the whole time i was traveling home and they didnt know if i was safe or not they had no idea what had happened until i actually stepped off of the plane
8358681 i go home because i have a wife and a daughter
8358682 i guess were gluttons for punishment because i would probably go on leave no matter what and deal with the second goodbye anyway
8358683 i was almost torn you want to spend time with your family but then you have your unit back in the middle east that you kind of feel a responsibility to
8358684 in 1994 i took a trip to england and saw a sheep dog event and was blown away by it
8358685 americans love dog competitions and so i decided to bring a competition to the states
8358686 the spring after the 2002 olympics i found soldier hollow i quickly arranged a meeting with the director of soldier hollow two weeks later and he enthusiastically supported my idea to host a sheep dog competition
8358687 when you tell people that you are into sheepdog competitions they give you a quizzical look
8358688 but what i tell them is to close their eyes and imagine wimbledon it is just as dramatic and has a tense ambience with a touch of hushed elegance
8358689 there is something about the activity of sheepdog herding that brings people together
8358690 i have seen people from the country mesh with city folk and together they become experts on the competition in two hours it has an intellectual quality that is not only complex but strategic
8358691 why should i help work towards this goal when i dont accept the premise that human activity is causing climate change

8358706 this multiyear award will yield a cost savings of more than 449 million for the u s army and taxpayers
8358707 this also builds security into our production schedule for the next five years stabilizing the work force for boeing and for our supplier partners in more than 45 states
8358708 the army is committed to providing an outstanding ch 47f chinook aircraft to our soldiers in the field
8358709 this multiyear award not only allows the army to field this important aircraft at a substantial savings but enabled the contractor to enter long term agreements for specialty metals to include titanium which significantly reduced long lead times for these critical materials the army was able to reduce the lead time associated with a new build aircraft by six months
8358710 this multiyear settlement is the result of the tireless efforts of government and boeing representatives it ensures that our soldiers will maintain a technological advantage over our adversaries when it comes to heavy lift missions
8358711 a long term contract commitment is good for the warfighter the army customer and u s business
8358712 this award enables boeing and our team chinook partners to make capital investments to reduce lead times for parts and components improve parts availability and provide for a more accurate delivery schedule which will enable greater precision in fielding the chinook to u s army units

8358716 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8358717 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8358718 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8358719 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8358720 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8358721 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8358722 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8358723 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8358724 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8358725 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8358726 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8358727 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8358728 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8358731 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8358732 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8358733 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8358734 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8358737 our child was slapped abused kicked and treated like a culprit in front of us the school director tried to strangulate him and abused him
8358738 the child cried for help and when we tried to intervene we were threatened that our jobs would be terminated
8358739 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8358740 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8358741 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8358742 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8358743 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8358744 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8358755 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8358756 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8358757 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8358758 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8358759 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8358760 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8358761 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8358762 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8358763 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8358764 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8358765 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8358766 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8358767 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8358768 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8358769 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8358770 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8358784 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8358785 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8358786 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8358787 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8358788 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8358789 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8358790 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8358791 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8358792 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8358793 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8358794 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8358795 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug
8358796 quite frankly i wish it were the other way around

8358807 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8358809 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

8358816 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8358817 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8358818 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8358819 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8358822 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8358823 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8358824 we are anticipating bringing a billion pounds of business on tourism alone just on the profile that london will have
8358825 theres a huge range of opportunities obviously things like training camps for foreign teams to come here but opportunities for our businesses to get direct contracts with the games
8358826 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8358827 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market

8358829 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

8358843 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally

8358865 we were looking at the sustainability issues from the point of view of city systems how you deal with water open space systems the public realm we were looking at greening from the most experimental and perhaps unaffordable efforts at this point down to affordable green housing
8358866 its a tremendous leader theres the pennsylvania horticultural societys work with community an international leader another area is the work that the water department is doing with drainage issues and infrastructure a lot of really sensational things are going on in philadelphia philly is equal to other cities that have been more highly touted
8358867 because people get distracted philadelphia isnt alone many cities in this category are distressed industrial cities but philadelphia under the radar has been doing really remarkable things that are hidden they should be heralded
8358868 look at the work the center city district is doing in terms of advocating for greening
8358869 it was always that way but it didnt always use those words from day one the public realm parks streets open space systems has been an essential focus of city planners as they incorporate these systems the green infrastructure into the comprehensive plan
8358870 over time we tend to put old wine in new bottles thats happened very effectively in the green movement we dont even have to go back to the early 20th century you can go back to earth day the public owes it to its constituencies to create a public realm thats green and sustainable this public realm should not be disconnected little pieces of greenery but a whole system that should frame a region

8358988 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8358989 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8358990 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8358991 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8359002 the july 12 storm dumped as much as 2 inches of rain in about 90 minutes pools formed up to 7 feet deep and flows several hundred feet wide eroded areas along patrol roads the waters even scoured some fence and vehicle barrier foundations
8359003 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event particularly an accumulation of debris superintendent baiza said

8359008 the farther away from the ocean you go the warmer its going to be
8359009 more than 1 3 million acres have already burned this year in california
8359010 vegetation is extremely dry across the state and when you add these dry north winds to the mix the chance of a major fire igniting increases
8359011 it was worth taking the time to go through the pilot process to really do it right
8359012 were excited about these series and feel theyre perfect additions to our dominant core slate of shows these are the initial pick ups but there are a number of other pilots we feel will also get the go ahead in some form moving forward
8359013 success of the propaganda campaign known as negotiations with the palestinians which convinces many that the status quo is temporary
8359014 olmerts proposal for a land swap introduces a new stage in the arrangement israel would immediately receive the settlement blocs but the land to be transferred to the palestinians and the free passage between gaza and the west bank would only be delivered after the pa retakes control of the gaza strip
8359015 over the past few months olmert has approved construction of thousands of housing units in these settlement blocs mostly around jerusalem and some are intended for the voluntary evacuees
8359016 any left wing meretz faction member could have signed on to olmerts proposal
8359017 israel also presented the palestinians with a detailed model of new security arrangements under the proposed agreement
8359018 the palestinians oppose any israeli military presence in the territory of a future palestinian state
8359019 for its part israel would like to supervise border crossings maintain a limited deployment in the jordan valley continue overflights of the palestinian territory maintain early warning stations on mountain ridges and hold emergency response units in palestinian areas
8359020 the armadillo engine is going to be the primary engine for the rocket racing league
8359021 now that weve successfully conducted a test flight with the armadillo engine we are looking forward to getting to racing and exhibiting a 21st century sport for the 21st century sports fan
8359022 specifications that we feel are required for safety reliability and reusability in a racing format
8359023 i am very happy with how the tests are going the first three flights were done in the first 24 hours we had clearance and cooperating weather
8359024 we have been ready for a while but the faa held our r amp d permit until after xcor flew at oshkosh then two weeks ago we were up in oklahoma and had rain or cloud cover all week
8359025 a slightly different engine bigger throat maybe more injector elements
8359026 whether we fly there depends on how we fly the test profile and how fast the faa moves
8359027 i hope that these rocket races lead to better engine designs for low orbit space planes and other craft that could be used to go between the surface and space without the need for large rockets

8359042 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8359043 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8359044 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8359045 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8359046 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible
8359047 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8359048 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game

8359058 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8359059 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8359060 by creating games and other programs for the iphone software developers hoped to find millions of new customers but they didnt expect to feel muzzled
8359061 the software development kit that apple inc distributed to programmers bound them to not discuss the process of creating programs for the iphone companies typically waive such legal restrictions once the product in question launches but apple didnt and it wont say why
8359062 as a result iphone developers and businesses that cater to them say they are prohibited from asking technical questions or sharing tips anywhere in public on apples official support website moderators remind visitors that they are bound by the nondisclosure agreement and should mind what they say or ask
8359063 conference organizers are trying to figure out how to plan sessions for iphone software developers when theyre not allowed to talk about iphone software book publishers are sitting on how to manuals afraid that if they ship them apple will sue
8359064 and software developers are forced to make applications for the iphone in an information vacuum without the help of a developer community that is used to openly sharing tricks of the trade quality may suffer
8359065 if every time you did something someone copied it and sold it for less than you wouldnt you grow wary im sure apple has a good reason for this and my guess is that it revolves around the patents that are still pending on within the iphone once patents are awarded then the nda will lift and all you folks bitching and whining will move on to the next item on your bitch and whine list
8359066 they seem to be a bunch of dolts and could use the brilliant expertise shown here

8359070 in todays economy many parents have to work outside of the home to make ends meet and the ys sacc program helps ensure their kids are safe before and after school
8359071 its not just about giving kids a place to go its about providing an affordable program that helps kids with their homework teaches them healthy snacking habits and keeps them physically active
8359072 when it comes to child care its important for parents to have peace of mind

8359109 barely twenty four months of the past few decades have seen reform that even paid lip service to freer markets

8359164 the size reduction in the hippocampus seems to occur sometime after the initial exposure to stress or trauma in childhood strengthening the argument that it has something to do with ptsd itself or the stress exposure
8359165 most people exposed to traumatic events do not develop ptsd
8359166 however those that do may show certain changes in their brains
8359167 the big question about which came first much like the chicken and the egg has persisted
8359168 we found childrens hippocampi were intact after the onset of abuse but somehow there was shrinkage in the group that had reached adulthood
8359169 with what we have found the effects of childhood abuse may have neurological ramifications well into adult life boiling it down people should be nice to their children

8359175 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8359176 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8359177 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
8359178 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
8359179 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the mysterious dark matter
8359180 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
8359181 our study shows how ordinal rank has a statistically significant effect upon well being
8359182 results show that human well being depends in a particular way upon comparisons with others
8359183 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8359184 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8359185 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8359186 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8359187 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families

8359235 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8359236 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8359237 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8359238 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8359239 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8359240 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8359243 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8359244 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8359245 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8359246 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8359247 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8359248 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem

8359259 se poate vorbi de o tentativa a chinei de a minimiza rolul sua in regiune de a l detrona din rolul de principal garant al stabilitatii in zona in orice caz accelerarea dialogului dintre china si coreea de nord conduce categoric catre aceasta concluzie daca phenianul va accepta conditiile beijingului succesul chinei in demersurile sale va fi asigurat

8359328 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy

8359449 food and drug administration is in no position to guarantee drug safety
8359450 lawsuits can serve as a vital deterrent and protect consumers if drug companies dont disclose risks
8359451 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety without the discoveries dredged up by plaintiffs lawyers through liability litigation the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct

8359457 the surest way to overthrow an established social order is to debauch its currency
8359458 lenin was certainly right there is no more positive or subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all of the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner that not one man in a million is able to diagnose

8359493 we report that oral inoculation with a y pseudotuberculosis strain selected for its very low virulence induces an efficient immunity against bubonic plague without causing adverse reactions
8359494 this demonstrates that a live attenuated y pseudotuberculosis can be a promising vaccine against bubonic plague
8359495 definitely we are spending the bulk of our time right now while everything is gearing up for the re release working on that we have been holed up in the studio just writing and writing and writing and banging out some new stuff
8359496 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8359497 the flu vaccination challenge highlights for healthcare workers the value that flu vaccinations can have on patient safety doctors nurses technical and administrative staff may care for patients with compromised immune systems including the elderly and people living with a chronic disease as a professional devoted to do no harm flu vaccination gives me an opportunity to help protect my patients by decreasing the chances that i will get the flu and pass it along to my patients
8359498 every year in the united states up to 20 percent of the population is affected by influenza and more than 200 000 people are hospitalized from influenza complications it is crucial that healthcare workers receive their influenza vaccination each year to help curb the spread of this preventable disease
8359499 the process of putting our ecaflo equipment and solutions up for complete and total inspection with the us epa has been a long and painstaking process while no epa requirement for registration existed when we initiated the application process we realized the importance of obtaining the epas product registration number through conversations with major oil and gas industry service companies and other potential customers in the food safety and healthcare markets although the field of electro chemical activation technology has existed for more than 40 years others in this field never approached the epa or sought registration for these types of anolyte solutions because of the necessity of the equipment to reliably deliver the solutions in the consistent repeatable manner needed to meet and pass the battery of various epa product registration tests through persistence perseverance cooperation and communication with the epa about this technology we now have the coveted epa registration
8359500 healthcare professionals are acutely aware of the importance of managing infections in the clinical setting to provide patients with the best and safest care
8359501 we evaluated a number of infection control systems available in the marketplace and decided that premiers would best meet these critical needs
8359502 we are excited to have sharp healthcare as part of premiers harm avoidance program we particularly welcome sharps quality thought leadership as we collaborate with other premier alliance members to transform healthcare research has shown hais are often preventable if identified and isolated in time premier is committed to helping hospitals find and implement innovative infection control methods to create safer hospital environments and improve the quality of patient care
8359503 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate charles said
8359504 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the u s to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8359505 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian healthcare standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics charles said
8359506 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs furthermore in the u s canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections
8359507 i am happy to be a part of this important campaign to prevent the spread of mrsa and help raise awareness among my fans and kids of all ages to stay healthy
8359508 hopefully they will see me in this psa and get the message that clean hands are cool and most importantly are less likely to spread germs
8359509 the growing prevalence of mrsa in hospitals and communities including in schools is creating new challenges for the healthcare community
8359510 it is important to make parents and kids aware of the little things they can do at home and at school to prevent its spread such as washing their hands with soap and water or using a hand sanitizer
8359511 we chose to partner with mitchel due to his popularity and appeal to our target audience young kids tweens teens and even parents
8359512 mrsa is becoming an increasing concern and cause for absence in schools and we think mitchels participation in this campaign will help deliver the message that handwashing is the single most effective and simplest way to prevent its spread

8359515 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8359516 the reason we knew she was pregnant was because when the fossil was found the body was broken
8359517 so there was egg shell on the ground just below the fossil it was falling out of the body
8359518 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells

8359555 but behind the curtain there is tons of activity in this space

8359653 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8359654 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first

8359667 the model of lending in which the originator of a loan sells it to various third parties known as the originate to distribute model became a popular vehicle for credit and liquidity risk management in recent years
8359668 however banks with aggressive involvement in this market had incentives to issue inferior quality mortgages this allowed them to benefit from the origination fees without bearing the credit risk of the borrowers
8359669 as long as the secondary market for mortgages was functioning normally they were able to easily offload these loans to third parties when the secondary mortgage market came under pressure in mid 2007 banks with lots of poor loans were stuck with them
8359670 poorly capitalized banks have higher risk seeking incentives due to the call option feature of equity enjoyed by shareholders of highly levered firms
8359671 the presence of subsidized deposit insurance can further exacerbate this effect thus otd loans issued by such banks can be potentially very risky
8359672 this fragility of a banks capital structure might act as a disciplining device by committing the banker to avoid risky behavior
8359673 the evidence confirms the popular belief that the lack of screening incentives created by separating the originator of a loan from the ultimate bearer of the default risk coupled with risk taking behavior significantly contributed to the current subprime mortgage crisis
8359674 from the markets perspective the probability of default on a mortgage loan partly depends on the originator of the loan itself from the regulators perspective the banks liability structure has a predictable effect on loan decisions

8359680 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8359681 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8359682 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution

8359689 this is what will happen you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black marked from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket or anything with the law theyre gonna see that youre a deserter then theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail you will do your time as you deserve all that lovey dovey i want to go to college and all this guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life

8359834 we dont announce names at this point we have many billions under contract
8359835 obviously starting up any advanced factory like these has its load of start up kinks to be worked through its a lot of work
8359836 at this time we are focused on product and customers and want to be known for making money not raising money
8359837 this financing was literally just a side effect of the industry partnerships we have established to implement solar utility power
8359838 abject failure to explain to the middle class families and rich people it was a staggering loss to everyone it was an

8359850 what stays with them over time is actually meeting an injured peer
8359851 we also uncovered themes related to their belief that they would be preferentially rescued or saved by the health care system if they were severely injured

8359856 its an understanding its a very different temperament that we have in canada and its very congenial i spend a lot of time explaining to americans well i used to i dont do it so much anymore why we are in fact quite different
8359857 we didnt have a civil war we didnt have a revolution we didnt have slavery people dont own guns and those are really serious cultural differences in the evolution of our countries which have led to very different attitudes to health to the social net the idea that you take care of other people and you dont just look out for yourself
8359858 i can sense the differences when i go back and forth

8359860 when we did the fly in the 80s i was heavily into italian opera the release of the fly in italy was called la mosca and i saw it in florence and i thought this should be staged as an opera then i started thinking about the characters and dreaming about it so the idea was really hatched around the time of the film in the 80s and its been a wonderful journey ive enjoyed every part of it bringing together different artists from different mediums was wonderful

8359905 seems to make adaptive decisions about what to remember and what to forget
8359906 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
8359907 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
8359908 this finding has enormous impact both in terms of suffering and economics
8359909 we may have missed many older business travelers flying to europe or the usa

8359923 the new york state attorney generals office is using purported legal and regulatory claims to promote a political message by announcing an investigation of climate risk disclosure among major u s energy companies
8359924 it is unwarranted to use the legal process to advance the just say no agenda which opposes practical energy answers and has driven america to an unnecessary energy crisis
8359925 the legal system is designed to protect not harass those such as peabody which are providing clean energy solutions for america
8359926 a process intended to protect shareholders is instead being used to advance a political agenda it is already accomplishing the first objective to gain headlines for a cause that has nothing to do with investor communications

8359959 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah even men and women and children and the kings daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes
8359960 44 13 14 because of their sins and rejection of the word of god faith in the living god did not exist like so many today they distorted the truth and made their own decisions on what they think the true word of god is making up their own gods
8359961 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
8359962 you pay her xxx an hour for her to be a c nt
8359963 like many graduate students i was attracted to for the firms outstanding reputation i had heard about the companys culture and that people come and stay with the firm i now understand why
8359964 after watching hillary clintons speech tonight i am truly sorry not to see hillary running in this election she portrays the knowledge of americas struggles today and knows how to convey it to the american people speaking on topics of health care rising prices and an economy in stress she knows where america is hurting being a democrat myself i am listening closely to her words time to unite and if a change is going to happen it is my duty to help make that change
8359965 hillary makes an effort to come across with sincerity on stage but i feel behind the stage she and bill are holding back their animosity michelle obama seems to be eyeing hillary with suspicion
8359966 hillary provided an excellent example of grace professionalism and complete teamwork
8359967 i like how she is respectful to mccain calling him a friend and giving a nod to his service
8359968 hillary clinton spoke of how important it is for the party to unite and elect barack obama she spoke of how far our country has come her mother was born before women could vote and now her daughter was able to vote for her for president she really hit home telling voters to think of their own children and grandchildren when they go to cast their votes have hope and faith in our nation
8359969 i appreciated that hillary posed the question to her followers of who they were really supporting during her bid for the presidency it reminded us that we all have a duty to vote based on the issues and not on rhetoric or personality although hillarys speech tonight was bittersweet for some of her supporters it signified a new direction they must take to unify the democratic party
8359970 i found senator clintons speech to be energetic and unifying although there was a bit of a swan song going on she did a good job of unofficially handing the torch to obama i thought she did a great job speaking better than i had heard in the past it could not have been easy for her to stand up there as a speaker not the nominee she did her job with grace and style
8359971 what a thunderous welcome her message to disappointed followers of their marching orders was powerful
8359972 hillary reminded us all to think about why we got so involved in this election we must think about the men and women in iraq and bring them home responsibly we must fight for equal pay for equal work and the people working for minimum wage and trying to raise a family for health care for people like the woman who is fighting cancer while raising two children that have autism we must remember that allowing mccain to win means allowing these people to continue to fall through the cracks and be forgotten
8359973 there are 15 top level private investors and a pool of smaller ones
8359974 could be an air carrier like lufthansa or air france
8359975 ive already told the advisers that eu rules must be respected
8359976 we will evaluate the decision when it comes out of the cabinet meeting tomorrow
8359977 this is the amount that is being talked about for top level investors
8359978 the environment is more challenging than when i did the q2call this is a fact also our results in july were a little bitweaker now we have to look at the numbers for august
8359979 for the time being i have no reason to go away from ourguidance nevertheless it is a little more challenging to get tothis
8359980 the markets are going down and also in europe we feel acertain weakening no doubt about that
8359981 we have used legal terms and have also put in some more accords to just make sure we dont get another surprise wehave done everything to really make sure that they stay at a49 99 percent shareholding
8359982 people are like hey he doesnt go on the internet
8359983 my answer thus far has been like if thats honestly what youre going to decide the election on thats cool if thats whats important to you
8359984 barack obama was first elected to the illinois senate in 1996 i remember that year
8359985 to say that i as a young person can remember a time when barack obama wasnt even in politics shows how inexperienced he may be
8359986 i didnt become a republican because you know i liked an elephant better than a donkey
8359987 i looked at the issues and i have an opinion on those issues and it just so happens the republicans share those same opinions
8359988 but when it comes to figuring out what theyre going to do and what our opinions are i feel like they dont see us as having enough life experience to know what were talking about
8359989 in our generation its really hard to be a staunch conservative
8359990 i had never heard the other side of the argument ever
8359991 on a lot of college campuses its more surprising to come out as a republican than to come out as gay
8359992 well be traveling through bleedstorm space between the universes but youll need to upgrade to 4 d vision to truly comprehend what you experience
8359993 we are providing retailers with a constant supply of wii fit so you should see a regular supply of wii fit on store shelves as we move through the summer and into the holidays
8359994 its great that you care about the city cool isnt it
8359995 kamloops is full of intelligent informed people whose opinions need to be heard i dont believe a council can be fully effective unless it acknowledges its duty to consult with the public as it makes its decisions
8359996 we basically scribbled notes on cocktail napkins and fed the information into word docs or excel spreadsheets
8359997 we realized a need to open our lines of communication especially when connecting four or five sales reps that could be linked to a single sales opportunity that might cover engineering companies in edmonton calgary toronto or houston
8359998 at first our sales executives were reluctant to use selltis sales since it involved more input of data and meant more accountability for their sales opportunities
8359999 now they have embraced it as part of their daily routine since they can instantly view a quote gain a better handle on planning run in depth reports and set up call activities
