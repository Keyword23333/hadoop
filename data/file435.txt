4350450 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4350451 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4350452 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4350453 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
4350454 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4350455 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4350456 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

4350482 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4350485 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4350486 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4350487 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4350488 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4350489 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4350490 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4350491 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4350492 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4350493 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4350494 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4350495 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4350496 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4350497 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4350498 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4350499 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4350500 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4350501 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4350502 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4350506 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4350507 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4350508 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4350509 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4350510 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4350511 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4350512 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4350513 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4350514 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4350515 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4350516 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4350517 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4350518 who are open to doing something on the production side
4350519 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4350520 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4350521 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4350522 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4350523 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4350524 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4350525 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4350526 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4350527 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4350528 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4350529 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4350530 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4350531 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4350532 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4350533 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4350534 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4350535 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4350536 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4350537 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4350538 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4350539 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4350540 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4350541 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4350542 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4350543 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4350544 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4350545 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4350546 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4350547 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4350548 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4350549 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4350550 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4350551 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4350552 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4350553 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4350554 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4350555 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4350556 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4350557 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4350558 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4350559 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4350560 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4350561 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4350562 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4350563 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4350564 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4350565 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4350566 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4350567 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4350568 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4350569 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4350570 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4350571 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4350572 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4350573 he is an affectionate guy but he takes his work very seriously and in training he is definitely a bit harder with us
4350574 he just wants the players to be dedicated though he doesnt want people playing around during the time we are meant to be working hard
4350575 i think we have everything necessary to win the premier league again and also the champions league
4350576 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4350577 we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now and look forward to sunderland we will not play as badly as that again we must improve and we will improve
4350578 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4350579 of course manchester united and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got
4350580 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4350581 commodity prices have entered a cyclical correction which looks like running a bit further
4350582 in the very short term commodities have become oversold and due for a bounce but the trend over the next six months or so is likely to remain down
4350583 find it harder to divert their exports away from the already weak us
4350584 worries about the international economic outlook and the implications of this for oil demand remained a damping influence on the oil price
4350585 global demand in the latter half of 2009 is expected to touch 89 million barrels per day compared to 85 million barrels per day at the end of 2007
4350586 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it

4350612 we have come to the end of temporary sheltering of these displaced people we cannot keep them for any longer period
4350613 the 2 000 immigrants in the six camps are all making arrangements to leave but we have a contingency plan to assist those who may be stranded on friday those who have no place to go
4350614 authorities have not communicated any plans for the reintegration of the displaced nor has it properly engaged in a dialogue with the camp residents about options for their immediate future
4350615 the information given to us by the authorities indicates that tomorrow friday will be the final day at the camps
4350616 we do not know what is going to happen tomorrow we are just waiting to see
4350617 at the beginning of the crisis in may the number of those displaced in gauteng province was 19 000 now we are down to only 2 000 in the camps

4350625 when i walked out into the stadium it was amazing
4350626 i almost started crying because of the whole experience and everything
4350627 i felt like i ran pretty well especially in the heat
4350628 i know its not as fast as the trials but its my second fastest ever and it got me some good points for whats to come
4350629 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4350630 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4350631 deshalb soll moskau engere beziehungen zur europ ischen union eu herstellen und gemeinsam gegen die entfachung von konflikten auf dem kontinent k mpfen
4350632 wir sind uns dar ber im klaren dass das regime saakaschwili in georgiens genau so wie das ukrainische und einige andere regimes direkt von den amerikanern aufgep ppelt wurden das sind deren politische projekte
4350633 dabei gehe ich von der logik politischer gesetze aus die genauso wie physikalische gesetze immer funktionieren in dieser hinsicht ist die situation jetzt vor allem in der ukraine herangereift f r einen schlag gegen russland was pr sident viktor juschtschenko dabei zum anlass nutzt ist eher eine taktische frage die ich im moment nicht beantworten kann
4350634 wir russland und eu m ssen jetzt verstehen dass die sicherheit in europa in unserem gemeinsamen interesse liegt w hrend des kalten krieges hatte amerika geholfen das problem des kommunismus zu l sen aber jetzt artet amerika selbst zu einem problem aus sie amerikaner wollen den frieden auf unserem kontinent ruinieren
4350635 in unseren beziehungen zur eu der ukraine georgien und anderen l ndern immer auf der bank mitsitzen
4350636 seine j ngste rede strotzt vor unglaubw rdigen informationen enth lt aber mehrere wichtige fakten nicht

4350638 you have to quit thinking of this as only sports
4350639 its a showcase for athleticism and talent every four years you get to see these super talented athletes compete you get to watch things you dont normally get to see on television
4350640 but we will get to as much as we can
4350641 in the long run america better remain engaged with china and understand that we can have a cooperative and constructive yet candid relationship
4350642 i see america as a nation that is a world leader that has got great values and leverage
4350643 i think the olympics are gonna serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have you know the opportunity to converse with people from around the world
4350644 this is a very positive development in my view for peace

4350648 this was the greatest experience of my life ive done a lot of major things in politics and life but theres nothing i have fonder memories of than what i did on this field
4350649 the single most important thing i did in preparation for the world i live in it was about working together as a team working hard nobody being above anybody else and one of the lessons you learn in football is one you have to learn in life youre going to get knocked down and you have to get back up
4350650 i still kick myself about plays i didnt make when i was here and still remember them like yesterday
4350651 i remember all the games of our national championship playoffs and everything that happened in them you ask me about anything else that happened in 1989 and i couldnt tell you anything
4350652 you dont have control of when youre born or when you die

4350654 were a little banged up at a couple spots on the o line
4350655 the timing wasnt there and in our offense timing is everything
4350656 we have expectations because were dayton we always have high expectations

4350669 washington is looking to knock you off theyre looking to make a mark for themselves
4350670 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 coming in here we know that every time we come here the washington nationals always find a way to play good baseball against us this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4350671 that second time through the lineup it looked like they made adjustments
4350672 we need to take care of things for ourselves what we can control we need to take care of business every day

4350677 society wannabes are the kinds of people who want to be on the list they desperately want to be taken seriously
4350678 there were people who just really objected to it found it invasive and were unhappy that we listed where they lived or the names of their kids or put up satellite imagery of their house in the hamptons
4350679 its a little amusing when people complain because its stuff thats really easy to find on the internet
4350680 its fun because its a place for the bold faced names of new york a place to catch up on their antics
4350681 straight scoop on the good the bad and the ugly
4350682 theres really no place to go to look up who people are and how theyre connected
4350683 you search for people online and pull up a corporate bio thats full of the charities they donate to but doesnt tell you the guy spent three years in jail in the 80s or hes been married eight times
4350684 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
4350685 records the names of men and women who god saw fit to have the character trait of a person who has faith
4350686 before his translation he has this testimony that he pleased god
4350687 if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you
4350688 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath
4350689 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he
4350690 the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity
4350691 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
4350692 widmayer corbell an online casino industry veteran was our top choice for vice president of sales and marketing
4350693 and we recruited heavily for this position basically we wanted someone with a lot of experience and sales experience
4350694 having you game together before you go for an interview is absolutely key to making it out in one piece if your top choice is company a do some practice interviews at companies b and c before attempting your top job choice
4350695 so as a result when we interview people we try to find out how their strengths and weaknesses can compliment our current team
4350696 and then was promoted to senior sales associate i worked this position for another year before moving to the executive marketing position i currently hold

4350724 we are all in the mud but some of us are looking at the stars
4350725 if i could not go to mexico i would go to peru or chile they both have fantastic ruins and ancient history
4350726 in peru there is macchu pichu which has great inca ruins and shows the greatness of their empire it also has many of their buildings that they built out of stone
4350727 chile has easter island which contain mysterious statues that no one knows how they were built they are great to look at and study i love exploring the statues
4350728 the spirit we might say is the matchmaker the celestial marriage broker whose role it is to bring us and christ together and ensure that we stay together
4350729 a friends is a single soul dwelling in two bodies
4350730 the character has a terrifying side to him this is a man whos died and come back to life so it twists into fantasy and of course there are tons of women in it there have to be its the spirit theyre all in love with him and hes in love with all of them you might say hes a bit of a slut
4350731 the approved mode of expression for the society and values of the newly empowered middle class
4350732 if god hated me because of this why would he make me this way
4350733 i shopped around for a lawyer until i found a fucking retard
4350734 you can take it with you how cars changed camping
4350735 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4350736 to keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4350737 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4350738 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4350739 these lovelies were are blooming on lake helen at reiman gardens and are simply majestic
4350740 to make sure there is peace and stability in the region
4350741 the united states is committed toward securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4350742 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region
4350743 there is not a clash of civilizations but its a clash of ignorance that all sides need to work on
4350744 the only way to settle this is to see who is the best in the ring
4350745 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4350746 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4350747 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4350748 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4350749 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4350750 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4350751 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4350752 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage
4350753 the next generation srx is the result of the continued exploration and refining of cadillac design language with the goal of creating dramatic presence in the luxury crossover space
4350754 darn this lecture is aish what am i doing here i wanna sleep
4350755 eh so are we going to get groceries or not
4350756 if i could not go to mexico i would go to peru or chile they both have fantastic ruins and ancient history
4350757 in peru there is macchu pichu which has great inca ruins and shows the greatness of their empire it also has many of their buildings that they built out of stone
4350758 chile has easter island which contain mysterious statues that no one knows how they were built they are great to look at and study i love exploring the statues
4350759 we got a lot accomplished with a lot of the young guys that are going to play for us that was the whole key coming up here we wanted to find out about a lot of young guys and
4350760 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the offseason and hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had
4350761 he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately and so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4350762 im doing something that i truly love and am excited about taking it into the season
4350763 these trips teach a message of love and peace and they have taken place three times without any kind of incident
4350764 the visits of the children to the holy places have never presented any kind of threat to the security of israel or to public order
4350765 these trips are important and exciting experiences for all of the children who are otherwise virtual prisoners in their own towns
4350766 it is unconscionable that the israeli authorities are now preventing even young palestinian christian children from traveling a few kilometers within their own country to visit religious sites of paramount importance to them
4350767 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a six year old to hear
4350768 although concept stores will only make up about 1 of our stores globally since they will all be located in high traffic and high visibility locations we expect them to account for close to 10 of our sales and we target them to achieve same store sales growth in the mid teens
4350769 following an extensive global search the government was particularly impressed by dr harleys experience and commitment to the development of a successful and sustainable local film industry
4350770 i am confident that dr harley will provide the leadership necessary as well as a fresh perspective in this new era of australian film and television production
4350771 that is a factor that cannot be overlooked by the government
4350772 what we have to ensure that tariff reduction occurs in a way which will be matched by achievements in terms of improved export prospects in other markets and the collapse of those wto negotiations has an impact on that objective
4350773 i think that they didnt take into account the fact that the doha round collapsed they havent taken into account the fact that the european union have maintained their tariffs at 10 per cent
4350774 that said however well weigh up the report in its totality and the benefit that it delivers to the industry
4350775 ive long argued that all of the subsidies going to the australian vehicle manufacturers should be tied to vehicle fuel efficiency to recognise that consumers want smaller more fuel efficient cars because the price of fuel is being driven by overall oil prices and that may continue to go up
4350776 the rudd governments overriding imperative should be to make every single vehicle on australias roads more efficient than they are
4350777 the australian automotive industry should stand or fall on its own two feet through its own efforts and they shouldnt be cowering behind a tariff protection wall and they shouldnt be waiting for governments to invest 2 billion of the taxpayers money in them
4350778 the government will respond to those ideas in due course
4350779 this is a high quality report that deserves thoughtful consideration and a quality response
4350780 our aim will be to achieve the best possible social and economic outcomes not just for today or tomorrow but for the long term
4350781 the government cannot pretend this is steve bracks report and not theirs the fact is they hand picked mr bracks to write the report they wanted
4350782 were certainly looking at a number of further allegations and making inquires in relation to that
4350783 the police have been working with a number of victims and if there are any others out there we would certainly encourage them to come forward
4350784 you dont need to know about field codes they are so old fashioned
4350785 what are these funny bracket things and gray places in my document

4350823 i i understand jessica stammered not knowing what to expect
4350824 you may pull on your panties now jessica dr steve instructed
4350825 we must first take your height and weight then your bust waist arms legs hips distance between eyes ears and other very detailed measurements
4350826 we can start by using a tailors tape to take your measurements while you are standing on this pedestal
4350827 we have calipers to take measurements such as the diameters of your arms legs fingers breasts and nipples
4350828 this instrument measures internal dimensions dr steve explained the device had a cord that could be connected to a computer to automatically transfer data to the computer as well as send stimulating electrical impulses to the subject if necessary
4350829 we will then have you lie down in several positions on a bed dr steve said while we make some internal measurements

4350840 we do this for the love of the music to give pleasure to others
4350841 if i ever hear songs like close to you ill just die
4350842 when they asked what music i listened to i would say classical
4350843 in those days rock and roll was not the norm among surgeons
4350844 we all have vocations while we wish this was our vocation
4350845 people can remember what year they saw the band based on adams height
4350846 that is what you do to give back for the gift of music

4350886 gt here for an overview of the forum and the participants posts
4350887 you discover how much there is to say about one tooth
4350888 you finally realize that true joy doesnt come from material wealth
4350889 youd rather buy a plastic tricycle than those shoes that youve been dying to have
4350890 you dont mind going to bed at 9 p m on friday night
4350891 you realize that the 15 pounds you cant seem to get rid of are totally worth having
4350892 you discover an inner strength you never thought you had
4350893 you no longer rely on a clock your baby now sets your schedule
4350894 you give parents with a screaming child an i know the feeling look instead of a one
4350895 your dog who used to be your baby becomes just a dog
4350896 you take the time for one more hug and kiss even if it means youll be late
4350897 when he is cleared we will take custody of him and process him
4350898 he shared with the detective that he had decided in december to come west and disappear and he felt that going west was a good place to disappear
4350899 wilson also told the detectives that the student community is a good source of food so he spent most of his days moving among the university student population
4350900 it is the kind of culture and environment where somebody can blend in and disappear
4350901 you dont know how good i feel about this it is better than anything in the world
4350902 it is like congratulations if you can live the longest without getting a paycheck
4350903 their goal is to kind of outsmart society he did it for a little bit
4350904 he is very smart and that is the typical mo for these kiddos
4350905 im not going to say woe is me matthew look what youve put me through
4350906 i want him to be all right if he is living a good life fine if he is living on the streets im not going to have that
4350907 were real grateful to hear hes alive but were still trying to get all the facts straight
4350908 we worked with metro on various options to get through downtown and necessity is the mother of invention
4350909 we really support linkages to the various parts of the city into downtown and to that extent we are practical about it
4350910 we would certainly hope to have an opportunity to comment on it when the time comes
4350911 i run out there on those trails all the time
4350912 i guess the best way to say it is that its one more bridge i dont think the impact is very large
4350913 were so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget that the inner value the rapture that is associated with being alive is what its all about
4350914 learn to pause or nothing worthwhile will catch up to you
4350915 you know i want to give you all of the things you need but i cant because theyre gone theyre broken
4350916 this is one of the largest studies in 13 000 people followed for an average of eight years and is the first study to explore the association between vitamin d levels and mortality in the overall population this makes our results more generalizable
4350917 this suggests to us that maybe if vitamin d is playing a role in cvd it is acting before the disease is established
4350918 this suggests that like anything in the body there is an optimum level of vitamin d
4350919 they should definitely be checked in people at risk of osteoporosis and perhaps in the other subgroups who are at risk of vitamin d deficiency such as women those with high bmi and ethnic minorities
4350920 back when this homestand started thats exactly the statement i wanted to make
4350921 i faced time wakefield two spring trainings ago but when you go up there you cant try to do too much
4350922 you dont know what pitches youre going to get and even though 90 percent of the time youre going to get a knuckle ball you dont know what its going to do basically you just have to see it and hit it

4350924 you feel fatigued and my location wasnt as good as it usually is but its something that i want to take care of now so i can get back out there
4350925 think of some of the best loved media brands american idol wired oprah the new york times all places with a distinctly engaged audience consumer brands are drawn to these winners because they want to be associated with quality sure but also because they know that if they can just get their executions right something magical can happen and they can influence that space between our ears and in the right context
4350926 i believe we are at the beginning of an explosion in online media brands akin to the explosion of consumer magazine brands in the 1940s and 50s or the explosion of cable tv brands in the 1980s and 90s
4350927 i just want my fellow sisters to look out for the signs
4350928 it was probably a mistake to require seat belts on school buses
4350929 its extremely expensive and there is no evidence it would significantly save lives or reduce injuries
4350930 i will fight tooth and nail to make my colleagues understand how important this is
4350931 when an accident happens dont you want children to have the same protection they have when riding in a family car
4350932 i think we need to get more input from school districts about what the cost is going to be and how effective its going to be
4350933 we ought to take another look at it and maybe try some pilot programs we ought to look at the districts individually instead of putting them all in the same box
4350934 the governor believes this legislation will not only save lives but give parents peace of mind every morning when their children leave their home for school and climb aboard a school bus
4350935 well do anything that it takes to get the ultimate goal the ultimate goal is to get seat belts in every school bus
4350936 my point has really been proven out with this accident we just had with a charter bus
4350937 its the legal framework in which we can all participate each assuming his responsibility
4350938 knowing how to negotiate and discuss what most serves the people is
4350939 i called on the lord to send his angels to protect us as i saw youths falling wounded and others managing to flee

4350978 militants are planning disruptive activities in a big way in the region
4350979 unlike sen obama who voted against the military commissions act and favors giving al qaida terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
4350980 underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
4350981 the black seeds are a tight we have set a solid foundation for the band over 10 years and with solid ground weve been experimenting with some new flavours and directions i believe we have all got better at what we do individually and together and have created some exciting new songs

4350986 while at home sivhidzho told me that she was thinking of selling the house and moving back to the flat i told her to wait for a while

4350988 she then came to me glanced at me and smiled before she asked do you want to exchange your car for a new one

4350996 it is an invitation to people to come to us resubmit their financial information and see if they are able to afford this debt and if not we will have to discuss the consequences
4350997 we are looking at the extent the customers credit records may have deteriorated significantly
4350998 they might have judgments or defaults against their names and that might have happened in the ensuing period since the home loan was first granted
4350999 in the past 12 months we have seen a rapid deterioration in the average customers ability to service debts

4351154 i would prefer shooting to dolls or makeup or anything like that just because i dont like it im not into that im more into outdoorsy stuff i guess

4351177 its going to be a very hard match but after the group stage all the matches are difficult
4351178 ivory coast and nigeria have played each other several times at all levels and its going to be very tough well do what we can
4351179 i just want to do my job on the field and try to push my team forward
4351180 there are good players and strong teams its great to see
4351181 of course brazil is a favorite for the gold medal but i think we are too
4351182 we wished etoo could make it but it wasnt possible
4351183 some of the girls have expressed concern but thats coming from northern africa not from beijing
4351184 heat is the issue numbers 1 6 then comes drugs the air is probably no 73 at this stage
4351185 a week or two weeks is not enough time to adjust anyway
4351186 i am not concerned about the pollution during the race but it will definitely concern me as i recover after
4351187 post race i plan to eat sleep and hydrate well in order to better recover
4351188 the thing that makes it unprecedented in beijing is the triple threat heat humidity and haze
4351189 if its not one thing the others are a problem
4351190 it can actually get into the blood and thicken it
4351191 that obviously has the biggest impact on those who are out there the longest in the dirtiest air
4351192 but no more than you would expect among a group of athletes in such a competition
4351193 hosting the olympic games has put a lot of pressure on us and we have to adjust to cope with it
4351194 i just hope i can run into the top three even the third place is a breakthrough for china
4351195 i ran a personal best really i am so happy
4351196 how can i compete with these professionals im just a young girl
4351197 some of the girls have expressed concern but thats coming from northern africa not from beijing
4351198 heat is the issue numbers 1 6 then comes drugs the air is probably no 73 at this stage
4351199 a week or two weeks is not enough time to adjust anyway
4351200 i am not concerned about the pollution during the race but it will definitely concern me as i recover after

4351209 of course brazil is a favorite for the gold medal but i think we are too
4351210 we wished etoo could make it but it wasnt possible
4351211 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4351212 my interpretation is that this a feature of increased awareness in the sports world that doping is unacceptable and you dont compete in the olympic games if you are doped
4351213 its going to be a very hard match but after the group stage all the matches are difficult
4351214 ivory coast and nigeria have played each other several times at all levels and its going to be very tough well do what we can
4351215 i just want to do my job on the field and try to push my team forward
4351216 there are good players and strong teams its great to see
4351217 yeah it feels good to accomplish something but you can tell by the atmosphere in the clubhouse its pretty numb in here
4351218 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed
4351219 i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires

4351230 hosting the olympic games has put a lot of pressure on us and we have to adjust to cope with it
4351231 i just hope i can run into the top three even the third place is a breakthrough for china
4351232 im not even coming to watch the next session im just waiting for someone to call me
4351233 man at the worlds i probably was at the bottom as far as emotions and my morale
4351234 i knew i had to get back on it so i started working hard and everything just paid off man lot of prayer and lots of hard work and it got me to this point
4351235 this skinny white guy working with all those hip black guys
4351236 he looked at me a little weary like being unique was a tired substitute for being popular
4351237 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4351238 i will carry this with me for the rest of my life
4351239 he looked me in the eye and told me he was sorry
4351240 i really wouldnt have been able to do this without the financing
4351241 if you had the choice of using clean power over dirty power and paying less for it wouldnt you take it
4351242 if the worst forecasts are true ill come out a big winner
4351243 through the stories we publish we hope to be able to make sense of the politics and pop culture around us which we think are indicators of the health of our democracy and of where the nation is heading
4351244 well the name also has a wacky and irreverent ring to it which reflects our hope to be able to see the humour or irony in some situations we are launching with a few features and basic site facilities more including the disabled friendly facility will be rolled out over the next few months

4351253 christmas on the pecos its just really an exciting time and its good for the community and everybody seems to really enjoy
4351254 it was crushing because we had a complete overhaul just recently done
4351255 its basically almost the exact same model of the bella sierra which we currently have through carlsbad cruise line
4351256 it is going to seat up to fifty people and is currently in the last stages of production
4351257 its one of the favorite times of the year were full just about all the month of december so its really good
4351258 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word

4351261 its a nice contract for my first time going overseas i hear cyprus is a nice little island
4351262 im happy to be putting pen to paper and hopefully i can just kick on and do well now
4351263 i thought i was progressing really well at the start of last season and i learnt a lot off the pitch during my time on the sidelines which i can add to my game
4351264 its a great feeling to be part of the long term plans here
4351265 it was just unreal i was buzzing about the whole thing
4351266 i count privett park as my home ground really you can even see the top of the roof of where i live from the pitch its across the road even on a saturday when i come in from my games with the youth team i pop in and watch the end of gosports game
4351267 i was at gosport from the age of six and then played up until i was 13 before concentrating on pompey normally you get 50 people behind the goal on monday night there were more than 2 500 there watching
4351268 hes a strong centre half he played a big part in rangers run to the uefa cup final last year he played exceptionally well in that
4351269 he hasnt got any particular frills about his game but i think that he is strong he wants to compete and as importantly he wants to go and see if he can make it in the premier league
4351270 hes got this driving ambition to play for spain which is no bad thing
4351271 i am not sure about jordi at the moment though weve had him here this week and you can see hes a decent player
4351272 hes played for real madrid so you must have something about you and by all accounts he did okay at gosport the other night
4351273 online casinos issues like this have never be argued in public
4351274 but i think it is for the better that we get things out in the open and more transparent
4351275 i really believe that my employers are genuine and care about what they do they are not out to prey on people or report false numbers they just want to make money and provide for the welfare of their company just like anyone else
4351276 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our online casinos products get the right emails
4351277 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of online casinos marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
4351278 i personally believe online casinos marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows online casinos industry leaders
4351279 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the online casinos industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
4351280 do you as business leaders and executives make sure that your books are 100 accurate and sound or do you leave this task to your respective accounting agencies

4351305 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4351306 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4351307 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4351308 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4351309 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4351310 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further

4351320 its a massive fight and it will be my last
4351321 ive known for a while when i want to go out and as long as i put on a great performance this is my time

4351352 when there are russian populations linked to russia then those territories could break away so if ukraine insists on joining nato part of its territory could split away

4351371 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4351372 georgia is a member of the united nations as such it has internationally recognized borders therefore the territorial integrity of georgia within those borders is not an issue
4351373 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions
4351374 so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4351375 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process

4351392 it seemed like the right thing to do 150 years later
4351393 it seemed like the best way for everyone to get a taste of the birthday
4351394 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
4351395 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
4351396 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
4351397 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed

4351401 apesar de crescer lentamente podemos dizer que a boa semente do conc lio est crescendo

4351403 a verdade que o pr prio conc lio n o definiu nenhum dogma e conscientemente quis expressar se em um n vel muito mais modesto meramente como conc lio pastoral entretanto muitos o interpretam como se ele fosse o super dogma que tira a import ncia de todos os demais conc lios
4351404 nas discuss es desses 40 anos sobre como realizar o cristianismo hoje com o interpretar e realizar o conc lio vaticano ii necessariamente tamb m nasceram pol micas e debates mas uma coisa que n o se debate com nada nada certo

4351406 how can it be bad for a politician when it gives you exposure
4351407 it was the worst experience ive had as a press secretary
4351408 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4351409 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4351410 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4351411 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4351412 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4351413 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4351414 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4351415 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4351416 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4351417 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4351418 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4351419 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4351420 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4351421 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4351422 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4351423 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4351424 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4351425 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4351426 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4351427 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4351428 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine systems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen
4351429 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4351430 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4351431 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4351432 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4351433 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4351434 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4351435 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4351436 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4351437 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4351438 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4351439 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4351440 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4351441 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4351442 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4351443 its going to be very hard to look at a partnership with russia in the same way
4351444 russia fully understands u s anxiety over the fate of its project
4351445 but at some time it will be necessary to choose between the prestige of this virtual project and partnership with russia on questions that require collective action
4351446 its striking to me that anyone would believe that russia is involved in trying to keep iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a favor to the united states
4351447 russia has levers it can use outside of those organizations it has half a trillion dollars in reserves and is the largest exporter of hydrocarbons in the world
4351448 so for the u s to say it is going to delay membership isnt a big deal
4351449 there has been a growing sense on the russian part over the last several years that theres a new balance being created in the world as a result of the americans blundering in iraq
4351450 putin and russian president dmitry medvedev have been unhappy about one sided actions by europe and the u s in the wake of the soviet unions collapse and they want to show thats not going to happen again
4351451 russians already believe the u s is advancing a geopolitical agenda that runs counter to its interests
4351452 in the past nations used to turn to the u s and nato for help such as during the balkan crisis
4351453 but now french president nicolas sarkozy and foreign minister bernard kouchner are filling the role that the u s used to take
4351454 if the u s waffles and the french peace treaty punishing the victims prevails then no one in the region will trust the west
4351455 if there is more of a confrontation russia will probably look for new allies and iran is readily available

4351654 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate

4351666 additional spending will eventually cause future budget deficits to become unsustainable
4351667 paul revere sounding the alarm about the governments unsustainable fiscal path
4351668 i am encouraged by congressman ryans leadership in his efforts to address this serious problem that continues to swallow the budget and swamp our economy
4351669 it shows tremendous courage and leadership on congressman ryans part that he is willing to lay out a comprehensive and detailed plan
4351670 if we look at societies with entitlements social welfare versus those that dont have or have shoddy benefits it is interesting to note that higher entitlements point toward more healthy educated democracies

4351672 cruches for 6 weeks only because if i would have used them for a year it would have crippled me for life
4351673 the us was the first major power to abolish slavery and recognoze the rights of blacks and women to vote and own real estate
4351674 as i said fiscal policy by ideology is stupid a commitment to an ideology regardless of impact has led us to this point

4351680 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications
4351681 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4351682 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4351683 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with

4351731 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilisation
4351732 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4351733 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
4351734 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4351735 athens clarke police arrested two men who were looking for love in all the wrong places wednesday night the undercover sting was in response to an increase in prostitution complaints in the area police said
4351736 we have a new guitar player thats gonna play for the first time tomorrow its the first time well play on stage together his name is wes borland and he used to be in a really terrible band that he left because he felt that it was a destructive force in art and he has his own band black light burns but now he is in marilyn manson we dont know how permanent that is but starting tomorrow will be the first step so this will be the most indestructible marilyn manson
4351737 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4351738 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4351739 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4351740 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4351741 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4351742 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4351743 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4351744 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4351745 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4351746 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home
4351747 its important that we start off the semifinal round in a positive way and we are confident the work from the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
4351748 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4351749 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion
4351750 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4351751 hes thrilled to be with this team at this time in his career
4351752 it came down to a very simple desire of winning another championship
4351753 i know hes a great safety and hes had a lot great years in this league
4351754 hes a hard tenacious hitter hes a tempo setter and he brings the wood every week
4351755 for a rookie hes learning the system like a lot of guys he has good days he has bad days i think overall weve been fairly happy with what hes done hes progressed a lot from minicamp back in the spring right after we drafted him he came back and knew a lot about what we want him to do
4351756 thats lower than the level of taxes when ronald reagan was president
4351757 the u s economy is in a weak state weve got a credit crunch high oil prices this is not the time to be raising anybodys taxes
4351758 when the investment tax rate is higher it affects behavior because we see a retrenchment of companies paying dividends
4351759 at a time when the 10 year interest rate is in the threes at a time when it is clearly lack of demand for products rather than the cost of capital that is inhibiting investment the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would somehow damage the economy in a substantial way seems to me supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history
4351760 the next occupant of the oval office is going to face some tough choices on fiscal policy but raising taxes on capital gains and dividends will only further endanger an already weakening economy and punish the more than half of all american households that are invested in the stock market
4351761 the industry would like to see support for more ginnie mae staff
4351762 they need to have an ability to respond to what is an unprecedented demand for their products
4351763 we dont know how much higher this volume spike is going to get
4351764 they need to have the staff to send teams on site
4351765 for europe to stop treating putin like a democrat if all opposition parties are banned or what if they started shooting people in the street

4351769 hay que buscar la victoria con mucho orden no existe desesperaci n por ganar porque el equipo ha jugado bien no s si el regreso de christian ben tez me garantice goles eso ser a hacerle al brujo aunque jugaremos de la misma manera tratando de que nuestras debilidades se vuelvan fortalezas
4351770 en el papel parece que indios al no conseguir victorias no producen para adelante no han tenido suerte son un equipo que lucha corre y se entrega por lo que debemos hacer un gasto importante para poder ganar en cuanto a emotividad s que ellos ya necesitan ganar pero nosotros para regresar a la confianza grupal debemos obtener los tres puntos el domingo

4351779 queremos hacer el campeonato zona norte de circuito 2009 en estas dos plazas a visita rec proca aprovechando el enorme entusiasmo que han mostrado por el automovilismo y motociclismo deportivo tanto los pilotos chihuahuenses como los laguneros
4351780 en chihuahua en las dos echas que hemos celebrado del campeonato por fortuna hemos contado con el total apoyo del propietario del autodromo francisco villa el licenciado marcos stege a quien identificamos como un enamorado y apasionado del espect culo del automovilismo deportivo porque en las dos fechas que se han celebrado en su inmueble hasta el ltimo abandona el escenario junto con los organizadores
4351781 por fortuna contamos con el apoyo del licenciado miguel irazoqui morales ejecutivo del grupo modelo torre n tambi n gran apasionado del automovilismo deportivo a quien una vez que tengamos la autorizaci n de michel jourdain de poder utilizar el aut dromo g mez palacio le presentaremos el proyecto con la confianza de que nos dar todo el respaldo
4351782 i have gained nothing but just brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4351783 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4351784 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4351785 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4351786 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4351791 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4351792 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4351793 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4351794 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
4351795 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4351796 we have integrated most of those students into the regular environment which is a move we support and believe we should do and there is a little bit of a transition

4351800 i send greetings to those celebrating the 61st anniversary of indias independence
4351801 led by mahatma gandhi the indian people engaged in non violent protests and campaigns in the pursuit of freedom
4351802 on august 15 1947 they achieved their goal gained their independence and became a democratic nation this accomplishment demonstrates that though freedom can be delayed it cannot be denied
4351803 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india
4351804 laura and i send our best wishes on the occasion
4351805 we have geared up resources and will have anti air attack systems in place in the capital some areas have been declared no fly zones
4351806 we appeal to people to observe august 15 as a black day and stay away from indian functions
4351807 militants are planning disruptive activities in a big way in the region
4351808 el primer lugar lo ocupa m xico y el segundo lugar irak pero la magnitud del problema en esos pa ses es casi igual
4351809 el fortalecimiento de la criminalidad asociada al narcotr fico ha tenido incidencia en el secuestro en este pa s cuyas v ctimas principalmente son empresarios y la clase media acomodada las v ctimas tambi n son con frecuencia turistas norteamericanos
4351810 la mitad de los pa ses afectados son latinoamericanos en latinoam rica se inventan las nuevas pr cticas del secuestro siempre ha sido la vanguardia
4351811 una de las hip tesis que tenemos sobre este caso es que fueron a matar a alguien porque hay infiltrados vendiendo drogas sin que el pastor se d cuenta
4351812 la iglesia cristiana evang lica no tiene un m ximo l der que nos represente para asuntos religiosos o ante la autoridad civil cada templo es su propio gobierno stas registran y protocolizan una asociaci n civil y con ello realizan labor social como son los centros de rehabilitaci n escuelas para ni os asilos de ancianos orfanatorios y otras acciones en beneficio de la comunidad
4351813 ya nos queda poco por entregar preescolares y algunas escuelas nada m s
4351814 visto el estado procesal que guarda la presente acci n de inconstitucionalidad se cierra la instrucci n a efecto de elaborar el proyecto de resoluci n correspondiente
4351815 los ex menes de oposici n para la asignaci n de plazas docentes violan gravemente la relaci n laboral y colectiva y bilateral por tanto hacemos un llamado al gobierno federal y a la sep a detener esa nueva farsa
4351816 las fronteras tengan rostro humano sean dignas y amigables para quien transita por ellas
4351817 se estima que son 27 millones de personas las que han sido v ctimas del tr fico de humanos

4351820 bajo el tipo penal de desaparici n forzada de persona
4351821 una reconfirmaci n de la tregua del pdpr erp y una real voluntad pol tica del gobierno federal
4351822 inexplicable la resistencia gubernamental a aceptar la reclasificaci n de la averiguaci n previa de la pgr por desaparici n forzada de persona en lugar de por secuestro
4351823 considera desaparici n forzada la privaci n de la libertad de una o m s personas cualquiera que fuere su forma cometida por agentes del estado o por personas o grupos de personas que act en con la autorizaci n el apoyo o la aquiescencia del estado seguida de la falta de informaci n o de la negativa a reconocer dicha privaci n de la libertad o de informar sobre el paradero de la persona con lo cual se impide el ejercicio de los recursos legales y de las garant as procesales pertinentes

4351830 vas a votar por el blanco o por el negro
4351831 la fragilidad real de nuestros sondeos es que tenemos una tasa muy alta de rechazos
4351832 y para ser sinceros eso es algo que preocupa a todos los encuestadores

4351851 hes like a little human stuck in a dogs body hes truly a member of our family
4351852 call logs dont indicate she called and our employees dont have a recollection of speaking with miss mcdonald
4351853 we cant go forcibly take the dog back or require them to return him its now their property
4351854 i think they should call the family that has my dog and say we adopted a dog that is not adoptable
4351855 this isnt good news for the economy and its not good news for consumers
4351856 theres no state in new england thats going to escape the impact of the national economic slowdown
4351857 i dont like day old bread but its looking good and tasting pretty good now

4351860 i came off that last wall and thought i had a pretty good kick off

4351862 i touched the wall and knew i gave it everything i had
4351863 im going to take it year by year im still young people are staying a lot longer in the sport
4351864 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
4351865 never have the well worn tactics of democracy promotion been applied with more devastating effect than in haiti between 2000 and 2004
4351866 was the declaration of human freedom universally consistent only in haiti was this declaration sustained at all costs in direct opposition to the social order and economic logic of the day
4351867 there is no single event in the whole of modern history whose implications were more threatening to the dominant global order of things
4351868 somewhere somehow theres a little secret satisfaction perhaps an unconscious satisfaction in saying things that powerful white people want you to say
4351869 when to use p re lebrun and where to use it

4351871 the very word says it all chim res are people who are impoverished who live in a state of profound insecurity and chronic unemployment they are the victims of structural injustice of systematic social violence its not surprising that they should confront those who have always benefited from this same social violence
4351872 it is better to be wrong with the people than to be right against the people

4351874 i myself have put a burden on the bullpen guys this year kuroda said with kenji nimura translating
4351875 and also in the games of this series our bullpen guys have had to help us out a lot so it was important to me to go deep into this game
4351876 i think the key for kuroda is his breaking ball torre said
4351877 when he was struggling he was just having trouble commanding his breaking ball now he seems to be free and easy and he is commanding it without much difficulty
4351878 its tough right now its just weird ive never been through anything like this
4351879 were a very confident team the good thing is well get another shot at them this week
4351880 right now our first concern is our bullpen and stults and sturtze will help our bullpen torre said
4351881 stultsy my take the start next time around or whoever isnt needed out of the pen the off day monday may help us a little bit but this time of year you try to give guys that extra day when you can
4351882 its more frustrating for him than anybody else he just hasnt been able to go out there with all his equipment
4351883 if i come back to the dodgers next year its going to be shorter ramirez said
4351884 right now im focusing on making the playoffs and stuff like that torre told me he was fine for now
4351885 as billy crystal says in analyze that its a process torre said
4351886 he took a little bit off when i made the initial request i asked him to clean it up a little bit he is within the rules of cleaning it up i guess
4351887 the market is much more focused on demand destruction than on supply concerns
4351888 the concern now is that the demand destruction in the united states will spread like a virus to other countries
4351889 yesterdays report was one of the most bullish in a year
4351890 the overriding sentiment of the market is bearish because of the negative demand outlook
4351891 over my dead body will you pay me for that food mister its time for a little payback
4351892 it is about time to take a step back and describe what i have been implementing

4351901 i firmly believe that strong arts programs equals strong communities besides the entertainment value the arts can bring people together the arts can make people aware of social issues the arts can educate illuminate and motivate it is proven from town after town across our country that arts venues and community oriented theatre groups generate income for surrounding and supporting businesses towns have the potential to thrive in a strong performing arts environment

4351906 i wasnt good enough to play for villa at that time i agreed with the coaches completely
4351907 i wasnt ready or good enough to play in the premier league it was in their interests to let me go and it was in my interests to leave and get some first team football
4351908 i had to wait a while until the right opportunity came along but it did in the end with hull and i was privileged to join this club
4351909 i was sad not to make the grade but these things happen in life and football i thought i needed to try to play my way up the levels
4351910 our first two in the championship were so difficult definitely not the same as the high flying success we enjoyed last season
4351911 but i can understand why youre saying its like a fairytale weve come from the bottom division to the top division in the space of five years and it is a massive achievement when you think about it
4351912 ill be playing in my fourth division with hull but thats the sort of thing you sit down and reflect on when youve finished playing not now right now i just want to get out there and play
4351913 i really wanted to play at wembley so even though we were a bit disappointed not to finish in the top two i was delighted to be going there and everyone said its the best way to go up anyway
4351914 we went to the stadium the night before the game and it looked a lot more intimidating when it was empty bigger than it did the next day when all the fans were in it
4351915 but on the day it just kind of felt like home i was very relaxed and i really enjoyed the game it was probably the most relaxed ive ever been for such a big game in my career
4351916 deano delivered as he always does and it was just brilliant a great day the achievement probably still hasnt sunk in i dont think it will until saturday when we start playing premier league fixtures
4351917 when the fixtures came out i just sat with my wife and thought how surreal it all is but its reality and weve now got to get on with it
4351918 i know it sounds a stupid thing to say but the one game im absolutely desperate to play in is aston villa away and its not until quite late on 2 may
4351919 im not so bothered about the home game in december i just massively want to play at villa park
4351920 all three of them were absolutely incredible to me while i was there
4351921 some of the things i saw them do were just amazing and it was a real privilege for a young lad to learn from goalkeepers like them
4351922 james was naturally very athletic but schmeichel he was just the greatest goalkeeper of all time to get to train with him regularly that was never going to do me any harm
4351923 sometimes it could be a bit frustrating because i thought ill never be able to do that but then you realise not many other keepers would have been able to either so it was a big honour

4351966 think clarence ashley dock boggs and other assorted banjo playing appalachian folk legends you might find on the anthology of american folk music the whole shallow grave lp his debut by the way is absolutely outstanding
4351967 matssons melodies are remarkably pliant and while its understandable to be skeptical of another skinny dude with a mustache a guitar and a worn out copy of the anthology of american folk music the more time you invest in shallow graves the more youll realize how unusually memorable it is ultimately shallow graves transcends comparison which is saying an awful lot given the popularity of its prototype and matsson is a natural born folksinger earnest clever and comforting
4351968 there is nothing to indicate that ufology is anything but claptrap
4351969 following sustained pressure by a small number of ufo researchers during the last 8 years the british ministry of defence have decided to release all of their ufo files for the full details of the planned release visit gary anthony dave clarke and joe mcgonagle have been making full use of the freedom of information act and its precursor the code of practice on access to government information at considerable personal expense effort and investment of time the three of us have submitted a steady stream of requests as well as making requests ourselves we actively encouraged and assisted other ufologists to make their own requests
4351970 everyone became aware that the object was unidentified satco code name for a controller with 14 years experience reports that the object came in at speed made a touch and go on runway 27 then departed at terrific speed in a near vertical climb
4351971 before a series of ufo reports in france in 1954 we rarely received reports of sightings from people driving along in cars it was from people flying in airplanes
4351972 if people see something they cant explain they try to fit it into existing patterns even something reported by others they dont have the mental discipline to look at something and not commit to what it is
4351973 the basic belief behind a car stop is that an electromagnetic em field dampens the cars electrical system and the engine effectively stops when reports began to come in about these encounters we find that people driving cars with diesel engines didnt report car stoppages while people with regular car engines did that supports the idea that something is happening because people just making up stories wouldnt originally make a distinction between diesel and non diesel engines
4351974 some em events occur in the presence of unknown metallic noisy disc shaped objects interesting but no slam dunk for aliens
4351975 regardless of what people are seeing that triggers ufo reports about 90 per cent of them involve nocturnal lights where else might you be when you can clearly see nocturnal lights certainly not in the city where theres too much ambient light youd likely be driving on a country road
4351976 experts are divided over how to explain the more recent surge in sightings of unidentified flying objects in the night sky over britain as more4 news reports but some allege that when it comes to ufo mania tabloid editors are reluctant to let the truth get in the way of a good story

4351980 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4351981 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4351982 if in one day a group of hunters in oregon accidentally captured a big foot a few fisherman found the dead body of a recently deceased loch ness and the president of the united states had a heart attack and was in the icu which would be the headline of the ny times if you were the editor

4351992 russians were told over breakfast yesterday what really happened in georgia the conflict in south ossetia was part of a plot by dick cheney the vice president to stop barak obama being elected president of the united states the line came on the main news of vesti fm a state radio station that like the government and much of russias media has reverted to the old habits of soviet years in which a sinister american hand was held to lie behind every conflict especially those embarrassing to moscow
4351993 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
4351994 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and civilian transit
4351995 the united states and poland reached a long stalled deal on thursday to place an american missile defense base on polish territory in the strongest reaction so far to russias military operation in georgia
4351996 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4351997 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4352007 schip and medicaid provide an important safety net for americas families especially for families with chronically ill children these programs allow kids to get the care they need so they can feel better grow stronger and thrive in school
4352008 when children who need care do not receive it their conditions worsen and are harder and more expensive to treat later because of medicaid and schip millions of kids can get regular check ups take the medications they need to stay well and see a doctor when they are sick parents of any uninsured child should find out if their family is eligible for low cost or free insurance before sending their kids back to school
4352009 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4352010 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4352011 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4352012 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4352013 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4352014 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4352015 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4352016 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4352017 they asked us to lay down and took all of our wallets and cell phones

4352038 oh yeah i know vince weve had him on the show hes a good guest whats the new book
4352039 well let me get back to you on this this may be a little difficult
4352040 mr bugliosi are you sure you want to publish this book
4352041 vince i cant find any audio company in america that will do the audio on the book
4352042 mr bugliosi the reason theyre not having you on television is because of who you are
4352043 if some nut wrote a book with a title like this the prosecution of george w bush for murder we would probably have him on because its colorful its entertaining it doesnt mean anything it doesnt go anywhere but youre a very serious person and you write very serious books
4352044 vince come on this is incredible youve been essentially blacked out by the mainstream media and youre still a new york times best seller
4352045 i guess this is just this is what happens during a war
4352046 if you hear about a hundred innocent iraqi civilians in a mosque or a market blown to pieces over there dont you get upset

4352052 upper level winds are gradually becoming more conducive for development and this system could become a tropical depression today or friday as it moves over or just north of the northern leeward islands
4352053 as of early this morning the latest track model guidance consensus indicates that after the system tracks just north of the virgin islands and puerto rico on friday morning it should continue tracking west northwest and reach the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands on saturday night
4352054 by monday night the track model guidance consensus forecasts the system may be tracking either due north or north northeast and potentially be located about 200 miles east of cape canaveral

4352064 planet earth needs me and a veto proof democrat majority in the house and a filibuster proof democrat majority in the senate in order to save the planet
4352065 therefore in the interest of saving the planet i will yield on the drilling issue at least until obama and fellow socialists take over the us government
4352066 however once the elections are in the books i promise to get back to work for the citizens of the world by shutting down all drilling and outlawing the combustion engine in america disclaimer theconservativevoice com and tcvdaily com accept no responsibility for the accuracy

4352068 yes i give preference to anitas and this is none of your business
4352069 if natya shastra lays down the criteria of who can be a chief guest i must tell you that i dont care ttd does not follow any shastras ttd is a religious ogranization that is guided in its mission not by the hindu scriptures but by the latest circulars issued by the atheist business and political community
4352070 its not fair and very demoralizing for the other schools students to read this blogs entry stressing the rising sdns virtual monopoly in the bharathanatyam competitions field since another big school bharathanjali regrettably lost its stature a couple of years back i fully support natyarangams policy that the big schools must not be allowed to usurp all dance competitions by sending more than 1 contestant there have been 5 dance competitions in chennai in your review you write about 3 competitions but do not mention that sdns dancers uma ramachandran and shravanthi were the winners at the other 2 bharatanatyam competitions that took place the day before the music connoisseurs clubs compe tition these competitions were a chennai districts competition of national bala bhavan and chennai districts competition of the bsnl cultural amp sports wing if 2 competitions happen on the same day how can a smaller school find the number of strong contestants to match the big schools dancers we strongly protest against such practices and will seek the abolition of such judgment parameters as choreographic quality and music quality it is not fair if sdn dancers win because they demonstrate better choreography and can afford to bring studio recorded music
4352071 at any oral exam you should try to go in first normally you will have some advantage
4352072 they are too young to understand the nuances of the technique and assess their performance objectively
4352073 well they are old enough to understand who dances better and who dances worse
4352074 it is not a problem for 2 dancers to pay the rent of the mini hall for 3 hours and give performances the orchestra fees are much higher than the rent anyway what matters to us is how many people will come and watch these performances
4352075 you see my 8 year old daughters bharatanatyam video we uploaded on the internet a year ago has been receiving more than 5000 views a month
4352076 how does it compare with 50 strong audience at a natyarangams program
4352077 it would be great i am sure it would support and re assert the judges authority too as they were up to the mark today
4352078 we are not judging how good a particular dancer is we are judging todays performances only
4352079 i dont think the judges are willing to explain and substantiate their assessment
4352080 bharatanatyam competitions compare these 3 and learn how to win
4352081 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4352082 one of the most comforting parts about moving away from home at such a young age and being put in such a unique situation as a young athlete is the family we become a part of and grow to cherish
4352083 in 1598 bc on mt sinai god showed six 12 hr visions to moses who later had them written down moses did not understand what he saw god was revealing to mankind the concept of geologic time and the history of life on earth after creation week
4352084 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
4352085 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
4352086 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
4352087 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4352088 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4352089 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4352090 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

4352092 these hcl technology jobs are a good fit for our economy and critical to the 513 families who will benefit from them
4352093 protecting the integrity of our nations critical infrastructure is among ices highest priorities
4352094 when individuals use fraudulent social security numbers to get jobs they hide their true identity and history we need to know who is working on our critical infrastructure sites
4352095 death to america even bringing out missiles that say that
4352096 i am decisively announcing to the whole world that if the world devourers i e the infidel powers wish to stand against our religion we will stand against their whole world and will not cease until the annihilation of all them either we all become free or we will go to the greater freedom which is martyrdom either we shake one anothers hands in joy at the victory of islam in the world or all of us will turn to eternal life and martyrdom in both cases victory and success are ours
4352097 the lost ogle satisfies our federally mandated rda for city buzz local celebrity gossip and female newscaster bikini photography
4352098 the times ive been on it some of their stuff has been pretty cute
4352099 despite questions about their origin the lost ogle serves up the wittiest most inventive and cutting edge commentary about the sooner state available today
4352100 i get a little nervous every time i go to it
4352101 the lost ogle is a wonderful place to spend time while in the midst of a 3 hour conference call second only to perhaps the okfuskee county jail
4352102 its like history on crack or meth more likely thanks guys
4352103 the nation inflicted significant damages and pain on many countries especially on people in asian countries
4352104 here i express on behalf of the nation deep remorse and humble condolences for all of the people who fell victim
4352105 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4352106 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4352107 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4352108 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4352109 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her

4352115 i wouldnt be surprised if the process goes all day and into tomorrow
4352116 so far the biggest trade was for clyde drexler because we won a championship
4352117 tracy mcgrady was pretty big too i think this guy ron really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4352118 im really trying to hold my excitement down but i mean we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far he adds another element to the team once you see him on the floor with the great players we have it really makes us very hard to beat
4352119 in this league a lot of guys are different when they get older and they mature
4352120 hes a different person now i think than he was years ago he cares about his on court performance and how his team is going to do more than he ever has in his life
4352121 this offseason one of our goals was to add a significant player
4352122 we feel we were able to do that and more with ron artest the former all star a player who plays both ends of the floor at a significant level someone who plays multiple positions to give coach rick adelman the options of the players he needs to lead us to the championship
4352123 when adelman had me on the court in sacramento he used me at every single position
4352124 sometimes he would play me at the two when there was a dominant two such as a kobe bryant or a dwyane wade or steve nash was killing us one time in phoenix he put me at the one he put me at the five
4352125 i work on my game every summer so i get better i dont make a big jump at one specific thing but i make a good enough leap at everything to be able to play every position ill be ready thats how i play my game
4352126 whatever adelman needs me to do whether thats come off the bench sixth seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4352127 obviously at some point were going to sit down with daryl i look forward to working with the rockets
4352128 we are riding on the choo choo as we learn to count to ten
4352129 am inceput discutiile legate de acest subiect si cred ca in urmatoarele 30 sau 60 de zile vom sti ceva sigur in aceasta privinta
4352130 youll see me happy when all the bastards are dead
4352131 one of the first things everyone has asked is how long did it take but every channel swim is different and each one takes a different route due to the movement of the tides
4352132 i took a longer route this time and started from a different place so i am quite happy with the fact that i was in the water for 12 minutes more than the first time
4352133 i am sure i swam faster on this occasion i know i couldnt have swum faster
4352134 i always new id do it at least one more time i had fantastic conditions and loved every minute of the swim
4352135 the dispute with them is over insufficient staffing levels and they have refused to fill vacancies
4352136 its got to the stage where people are having to cover for colleagues as theyve not got the staff to go round
4352137 theyre probably 16 people down on what they were in the last three or four years
4352138 ballot papers are going out towards the end of the week and its normally a week for people to vote
4352139 the nuj is balloting its members over the non replacement of two staff positions due to the economic climate
4352140 i wonder how this fits in with their solemn promise of free and unrestricted reporting it was a wrestling match
4352141 with cent sports you have a lifetime supply of dimes to bet with what could be better than that
4352142 i have never felt such a rush watching tennis when nadal was up 5 3 in the third set against mathieu in the australian open i was shaking the penny jar i knew my time had come
4352143 jag har f rst else f r att han var missn jd med domslutet men man ska alltid upptr da sportsligt
4352144 theyre going to show up and yall are going to be pleased by what you see
4352145 qu es lo que lleva a un ser humano a realizar una
4352146 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4352147 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4352148 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
4352149 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4352150 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4352151 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4352152 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out
4352153 if you cant say anything nice smart assy interesting or hella funny dont say anything at all
4352154 of course that is precisely why i am doing this right now i havent hit upon any idea to write about
4352155 guess what in 6 xxx days well be at dragon con
4352156 i had to wait 8 weeks for the answer to that
4352157 yeah was it uphill in the snow both ways too
4352158 you dont see as many cars out as you used to
4352159 i dont even take mine out as much as i used to
4352160 the gas prices have really affected our friends who are retired
4352161 and when they dont go we dont because we dont want to go to the shows by ourselves
4352162 so i had a little sticker shock when i filled it up this week
4352163 for every car that doesnt come we seem to get more new ones
4352164 when you have a 250 000 corvette 4 a gallon doesnt seem like much
4352165 if this isnt love then i think i have the bird flu
4352166 in a nutshell stv the electoral system currently in place is where you rank candidates in your order of preference 1 2 3 and so on and fpp is where you place a tick beside your preferred candidates
4352167 weve got plenty of information available on the two systems so registered voters can read up decide which they prefer and then cast their vote
4352168 when i saw his hands coming out i just went for my purse and i didnt let him have
4352169 when he said excuse me may i have the time you dont expect someone to steal your purse if they say excuse me they tried
4352170 one of the concerns is that they are tending to strike more frequently
4352171 the concern is that they will just get bolder we want to get them caught
4352172 do not put your purse in the cart have it with you all the time
4352173 dear dad i miss you very much me and dylan know what happened
4352174 im sorry you had to lose a son and an ex wife and im sorry we were taken from you we are still alive and we are ok
4352175 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4352176 i know theres a lot of activity on the streets
4352177 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
4352178 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
4352179 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4352180 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4352181 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4352182 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4352183 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4352184 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4352185 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4352186 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4352187 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4352188 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4352189 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4352190 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4352191 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4352192 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4352193 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4352194 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4352195 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4352196 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4352197 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4352198 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4352199 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4352200 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4352201 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4352202 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4352203 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4352204 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4352205 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4352206 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4352207 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4352208 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4352209 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4352210 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4352211 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4352212 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4352213 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4352214 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4352215 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4352216 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4352217 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4352218 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4352219 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4352220 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4352221 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4352222 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4352223 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4352224 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4352225 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4352226 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4352227 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4352228 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4352229 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4352230 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4352231 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4352232 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4352233 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4352234 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4352235 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4352236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4352237 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4352238 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4352239 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4352240 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4352241 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4352242 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4352243 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4352244 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4352254 many authorities have concluded that because of the constantly shifting moral connotations of the concept of sexual obscenity it is not possible to completely and objectively define the term pornography and that in the final analysis pornography is in the eye of the beholder
4352255 she has never really been able to follow them but she inadvertently did follow them with one guy and ended up marrying him so there is proof that they work

4352309 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4352310 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4352311 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4352312 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4352313 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4352314 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4352315 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4352319 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
4352320 never have the well worn tactics of democracy promotion been applied with more devastating effect than in haiti between 2000 and 2004
4352321 was the declaration of human freedom universally consistent only in haiti was this declaration sustained at all costs in direct opposition to the social order and economic logic of the day
4352322 there is no single event in the whole of modern history whose implications were more threatening to the dominant global order of things

4352324 when to use p re lebrun and where to use it
4352325 you may never use it again in a state where law prevails
4352326 the very word says it all chim res are people who are impoverished who live in a state of profound insecurity and chronic unemployment they are the victims of structural injustice of systematic social violence its not surprising that they should confront those who have always benefited from this same social violence
4352327 it is better to be wrong with the people than to be right against the people

4352335 i dont put more than 5 of a clients assets with any of them
4352336 if one fund is in trouble another is usually doing well
4352337 it doesnt bother me if shareholders leave because we underperformed on the markets upside but id be very unhappy if they left because we performed worse on the way down
4352338 we dont want to be in a position where our investors are redeeming our shares and we dont have the cash to pay them that would force us to sell positions we like at a loss
4352339 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4352340 whereas its a new venue its not a new challenge for us
4352341 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
4352342 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
4352343 if you identify the anarchists early and they engage in criminal behavior snatch them up right now
4352344 the further you delay the more damage they can do to the process of legitimate protest

4352389 the european union vill inevitably need strong partners to succeed in the fight against terrorism on a global scale in this context the european union should also deepen the regular dialogue mechanism with the russian federation within the framework of the permanent partnership councul on security also including where appropriate trilateral meetings with the united states
4352390 russia is together with the us our main strategic partner in the field of justice freedom and security the framework for our cooperation with russia is the eu russia common space of the freedom security and justice which is very comprehensive ranging from counter terrorism to the fight against drug trafficking from migration and asylym to judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters
4352391 this was a backdoor attempt by out of state interests to overturn a law passed fair and square
4352392 the states interest in preventing fraud in the petition process
4352393 when they come forward and say hey these were our signatures this is me why did you reject it thats a just a matter of fairness
4352394 it doesnt matter what the issue is whether its land use or medical marijuana the process needs to be fixed
4352395 this case was never necessarily about the signature verification process it was about overturning the domestic partnership law and that was a very real threat
4352396 but i think there has been a real change to how people view fairness and equality
4352397 he was an excellent football player the more you watched our tapes the more you realize how good he played last year

4352400 hes always in the right gap he doesnt lose contain
4352401 we moved quintrel inside because we really think hes a defensive tackle
4352402 i still think quintrels a better what i call an a and b gap player a tackle than an end we convinced him he was a tackle and then when d j went down we had to re convince him that hes an end
4352403 honestly i think im more comfortable at d tackle just because its more to the point
4352404 ive nearly called him into my office two or three times to tell him hes not big enough to play because hes not

4352411 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings
4352412 such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages
4352413 initially communication would be based on a limited set of words or phrases that are recognized by the system it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology is developed further

4352417 stuarts very nice but hes got a lot of support as well
4352418 thats what i mean if i was up against someone that i thought was not very nice then i would be more worried
4352419 if i was up against someone who was really evil and then i went id be worried
4352420 but stuarts a nice guy so im not worried about it
4352421 oh i know what that is it happens to me all the time
4352422 treatment methods borrowed from medicine are taking hold in perfumeries
4352423 an ultrasound device whose wavees penetrate deep enough to be effective would cost far too much
4352424 a rich cream then can be easily worked into the skin
4352425 such a treatment should be done only once every six weeks
4352426 if a microdermabrasion is to be really effective a lay person must be careful
4352427 in the worst case it can leave chemical burns on the skin
4352428 the skin of our test subjects looked exactly the same after a treatment as before the money can be saved for other purposes
4352429 everything that the cosmetic industry offers in skin care products on the shelf is sufficient for taking care of normal skin
4352430 numerous cambodians including journalists and students make spelling errors this dictionary will be very useful for them one can refer to it or check the meaning of a word or its spelling with just a simple click
4352431 errors are unavoidable but i hope that they will be less than 2 everything was checked several times among the 18 003 words in the dictionary we only found 461 keywords without definition we will ask the national committee of the khmer language to meet to define them
4352432 we want to encourage cambodians to use khmer unicode software later on we will come up with a software to make it accessible on mobile phones
4352433 we will bring in a yearly update in order to reduce the number of errors to the maximum one day cambodians will be able to download this dictionary on the website www budinst gov kh

4352452 wilson also told the detectives that the student community is a good source of food so he spent most of his days moving among the university student population
4352453 it is the kind of culture and environment where somebody can blend in and disappear
4352454 you dont know how good i feel about this it is better than anything in the world
4352455 it is like congratulations if you can live the longest without getting a paycheck
4352456 their goal is to kind of outsmart society he did it for a little bit

4352465 texas dps received a letter from the fmcsa asking us to perform a variety of stepped up bus enforcement actions specifically roadside inspections
4352466 in response to that dps started conducting random roadside bus inspection operations throughout the state
4352467 we want to be aggressive in getting our message out
4352468 it is beneficial to stay in school it reduces cases for our dockets and brings us good citizens
4352469 is that the letter comes from the district attorneys office it carries a lot more clout than a letter from the school district
4352470 have been effective by simply providing knowledge that future steps will be taken
4352471 it was probably a mistake to require seat belts on school buses
4352472 its extremely expensive and there is no evidence it would significantly save lives or reduce injuries
4352473 i will fight tooth and nail to make my colleagues understand how important this is
4352474 when an accident happens dont you want children to have the same protection they have when riding in a family car
4352475 i think we need to get more input from school districts about what the cost is going to be and how effective its going to be
4352476 we ought to take another look at it and maybe try some pilot programs we ought to look at the districts individually instead of putting them all in the same box
4352477 the governor believes this legislation will not only save lives but give parents peace of mind every morning when their children leave their home for school and climb aboard a school bus
4352478 well do anything that it takes to get the ultimate goal the ultimate goal is to get seat belts in every school bus
4352479 my point has really been proven out with this accident we just had with a charter bus
4352480 we worked with metro on various options to get through downtown and necessity is the mother of invention
4352481 we really support linkages to the various parts of the city into downtown and to that extent we are practical about it
4352482 we would certainly hope to have an opportunity to comment on it when the time comes
4352483 i run out there on those trails all the time
4352484 i guess the best way to say it is that its one more bridge i dont think the impact is very large
4352485 the pitches i should be hitting i havent been getting the bat head to the ball
4352486 it took a little stress away knowing that i could hit a pretty good pitch like that again
4352487 you start to wonder after a while if youll do something like that again
4352488 i think its because of stress more than anything else
4352489 i come to the park upbeat and confident and then after one or two at bats you go here we go again
4352490 it would be nice to finish strong and make strides to be where i want to be next year
4352491 he was a guy we looked at as being very versatile with a strong arm
4352492 we think he is a guy that would be very valuable for manager dusty baker because he can play many positions and run well
4352493 i think when it comes to his role well evaluate him more when we bring him up and determine how well use him
4352494 hopefully it will in the next couple of weeks but i cant give an answer on that yet
4352495 he may want to get away from it all but im expecting him back saturday
4352496 i cant remember a swing or any one thing the first game it was sore but i really didnt think about it the next morning i got up and i really couldnt get it loose
4352497 hes progressing but i want to make sure he keeps progressing before i send him out there
4352498 thats to make sure hes right im handling it im not relying on anybody else i want hank to feel clean in his mind
4352499 we dont know why they did it but we want to find them

4352505 me tropec con una corredora pero tuve suerte de que no perd el equilibrio y pude recuperarme del tiempo perdido en los segundos finales de la carrera

4352507 ive written derek several letters he has not responded to this day
4352508 she just wanted to say goodbye to her son thats it

4352510 thats what she wanted she just wanted to see her son she couldnt even do that she couldnt do it
4352511 why would somebody do that why would they fake it
4352512 he says hes out here trying to be a service to the community
4352513 but hes not of service to the community hes a crook hes a crook and i mean a crook
4352514 i try to spend a lot of time with my patients
4352515 you can operate on ears not whats between the ears
4352516 could never understand why anyone would ever do anything to their nose
4352517 people are busy and i think they really like that availability that we have
4352518 i spend a lot of time with patients talking about how to take care of their teeth
4352519 i know their health history and families their quirks and their needs
4352520 we see about 95 percent of our patients right on time
4352521 i listen to them and i try my best to problem solve in a beneficial way
4352522 it is an honor to be able to take care of interesting people
4352523 my favorite part of my job is making something that is confusing to my patients more clear
4352524 when people join here they get a sense that its kind of like a family
4352525 we try to find a niche for everyone to feel comfortable
4352526 its a great place to come and kind of get away from it all

4352528 we consider ourselves to be a community hospital with a strong focus on service and keeping our members and the community healthy
4352529 we deliver half of all babies born in san francisco
4352530 it is the kind of place you want to come whether for you or your children or a significant other
4352531 people understand that stanford hospital offers a unique depth and breadth of expertise
4352532 we do our best to give excellent care on an individual basis
4352533 i strive to be totally present which allows me to listen completely
4352534 i always take parents concerns very seriously i dont believe in any stupid questions
4352535 i used to be a person everyone liked and now its totally the opposite

4352541 when i came to visit i really liked the girls on team so that was a factor too
4352542 i mean you really have to fight a lot harder at this level because everyone is good
4352543 right now everything is new for everyone with a new coach and system but it is nice to have a lot of the older girls helping me out
4352544 as of right now i am trying to just find my place on the team and do what i can to help

4352612 i think the academics doing its research should be seen as just as important as industry pursuing its own goals
4352613 i think our project is one that sits in that gap and i dont believe you can always drag pure university research towards commercial relevance i think if you can fund the gap both sides of research can benefit each other

4352716 many of them have tanks that are full and until they find a new purchaser will have to shut down those wells
4352717 it could be a couple of months or longer most small producers in the state invest 100 percent or more in drilling new wells or working on old wells some of that activity will slow down or stop some drilling contracts will stop servicing companies will see cancellations as drilling companies try to see what their cash flow will be

4352719 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4352720 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4352721 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4352722 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4352723 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4352724 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4352725 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4352726 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4352800 if everyone is doing what im doing will that be ok for my society
4352801 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4352802 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4352803 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4352804 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
4352805 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
4352806 i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
4352807 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4352808 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4352809 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4352810 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4352811 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4352812 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4352813 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4352814 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4352815 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4352816 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4352817 the governor also indicates that she does not believe the charges or circumstances here merit the use of the pardon power

4352838 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4352839 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4352840 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you
4352841 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4352842 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4352843 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4352844 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4352845 the united states stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia
4352846 we are still experiencing technical issues with our shipping systems
4352847 i just freed you of the pain why would you put yourself back in it
4352848 ive progressed in my poses over the past six months no doubt but whether thats down to the rolfing i cant say
4352849 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4352850 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4352851 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4352852 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4352853 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4352854 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4352855 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4352856 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4352857 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4352858 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4352859 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4352860 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4352861 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4352862 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4352863 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4352864 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4352865 its hard to image that more than 120 000 children in colorado suffer from hunger
4352866 the funds raised from this years event will support our local efforts to end childhood hunger and supply low income families with the foods they need to lead healthy active lives
4352867 and was scared everytime a security guard walked towards me

4352883 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4352884 dead zones tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4352885 there are large areas of the gulf where you cant catch any shrimp
4352886 the overwhelming response of the organisms in our coastal areas is to migrate or to die
4352887 to adapt to low oxygen water it has to be a part of your evolutionary history its not something you can develop in a 40 or 50 year time period
4352888 they have major consequences for the ability of fish populations to renew themselves
4352889 but the challenge is how do you manage fertilizer use without compromising the ability of the world to feed people
4352890 but its one of the major problems we face in terms of the health of coastal ecosystems
4352891 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
4352892 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4352893 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4352894 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4352895 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this

4352901 open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country
4352902 will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4352903 this is not a judgment statement it is neither right or wrong but corporations have made the choice more often than not to locate into a corporate campus suburban setting like a century city office park much more often than they opt for a downtown or westend gulch location
4352904 so perhaps we find in 20 years that corporate campuses arent desirable
4352905 the discourse from the commissioners proved interesting as several seemed to go beyond the role of land use planning to take on the responsibility of economic development
4352906 the important part is that we were able to eradicate a pest before it spread out of the infested area

4352909 it the net is closing on the offenders and we will get a result and that is what john and his family deserve
4352910 positive headway this week and we are confident of an arrest
4352911 these offenders went to number 24 the death scene at 24 justamere place for a reason and based on that the rest of the community can feel safe this is not a random attack
4352912 we do have an appreciation on what has been going on at no 24
4352913 no family deserves to have their 14 year old son die in their arms and that is the bottom line here
4352914 we are all different we all have different personalities we all make different life choices and it is not for me to comment on the familys life choices
4352915 i was going in too deep its not nice coming up like a big fish with your sinuses full of salt water

4352921 one problem with liquor is that it is always the subject of a conscience vote in parliament
4352922 this does not help indeed it is hard to see why liquor should be the subject of a conscience vote the fact that it always has been in hardly a good reason
4352923 it there were not a conscience vote it would certainly assist in securing a coherent consistent and rational framework for dealing with a substance that imposes significant social costs on new zealand
4352924 l a s future depends on our willingness to adopt an ethic of conservation these first steps represent the beginning of our march toward sustainability and success
4352925 it is a blunt recognition that we face a water shortage in this city and it is a visionary road map as to how we are going to provide for water supplies here in the city

4352982 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

4352987 if im a little sore one day maybe lighten it up a little bit gerhart noted
4352988 or in terms of a game if its third and one and ive got 5 or 6 yards go down dont do unnecessary stuff its kind of hard my personality is to keep going but youve got to worry about the season in the long run and not just one play
4352989 when guys come up to tackle him they dont know what theyre in for quarterback tavita pritchard said
4352990 i felt kind of like i was back in high school the game slowed down gerhart said
4352991 i tried to help out the younger guys more said gerhart who played all 12 games as a freshman in 2006
4352992 i tried to become like a coach i stayed in the game even though i couldnt participate myself

4352995 they smelt alcohol on his breath and he admitted to drinking alcohol prior to driving
4352996 they asked him to provide a breath specimen but he refused
4352997 the officers decided to arrest him but he resisted and when one of them grabbed him by the arm he took the officers handcuffs and ran away
4352998 he seems to have come to terms with that particular difficulty
4352999 what shines through is he understands the predicament hes in and wishes to have some long term and specialised intervention to rid himself of that difficulty
4353000 he was loving caring and he thought the world of his family and his mates
4353001 if anyone was ever in trouble and he could help he would be there he was there for anyone
4353002 for the first few hundred yards after leaving the stadium there are no street lights the pavement is narrow and there is some overgrowing vegetation
4353003 it was like walking along a country lane except that this was a very crowded path with buses travelling very close to the pavement at what i thought was at a speed too fast for the conditions
4353004 i am fearful that there could be a serious incident if this situation is to be a permanent feature after matches and other events at the community stadium which generates a large volume of pedestrians using boxted road
4353005 in the interests of safety for pedestrians i believe the pavement in boxted road from united way to the entrance to the former severalls hospital should be widened
4353006 further i believe that street lights should be installed along this section of boxted road
4353007 we are grateful to mr russell for his comments and have already intervened to address the issue of the overgrown shrubbery caused by an adjacent property
4353008 the footway along boxted road is of a standard width of 1 7 metres passable to at least two people at a time and an adjacent verge can be used by more pedestrians as well
4353009 we are keeping the situation under review and will continue to observe pedestrians using the route on match days suffolk homes
4353010 the council will decide the next course of action to take once it receives the report from the hpa
4353011 at this stage we do not know exactly when that will be but it is certainly likely to be a couple of weeks

4353015 bert was such a special man he loved people he loved hymn singing and he loved trying out new forms of worship
4353016 he had a very remarkable open mindedness to the world around him and a wisdom that came both from his long experience of life and a profound faith that was based on daily prayer and bible reading
4353017 he used to stand outside church each sunday and be the first to welcome them and he had the knack of remembering something that was important to them its no surprise that he was so well loved

4353022 it the net is closing on the offenders and we will get a result and that is what john and his family deserve
4353023 positive headway this week and we are confident of an arrest
4353024 these offenders went to number 24 the death scene at 24 justamere place for a reason and based on that the rest of the community can feel safe this is not a random attack
4353025 we do have an appreciation on what has been going on at no 24
4353026 no family deserves to have their 14 year old son die in their arms and that is the bottom line here
4353027 we are all different we all have different personalities we all make different life choices and it is not for me to comment on the familys life choices

4353058 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
4353059 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
4353060 for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god
4353061 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not on thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
4353062 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained
4353063 the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender
4353064 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
4353065 withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me
4353066 let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort according to thy word unto thy servant
4353067 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
4353068 to walk away and not have signed our third round pick would be disappointing
4353069 but obviously as time has gone on with this theres a self evaluation of what went wrong and what we could have done better
4353070 ill stand by all the work the scouts have done pre draft and post draft this more lies in the players heart they tend to waiver and change throughout the process
4353071 is this the house with the bowling pin in the back yard
4353072 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4353073 my interpretation is that this a feature of increased awareness in the sports world that doping is unacceptable and you dont compete in the olympic games if you are doped
4353074 its been clarified that the best way to support a sport that has a doping problem is not to throw it out but rather to help it
4353075 we hope we will be able to help the sport of cycling we hope that olympic cycling will be a cleaner sport than cycling in general is today im hopeful for the sport in the future they have to take strong action and i think everyone realizes that
4353076 if i knew the difference i would have made the adjustment right away
4353077 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year where he was really dominating
4353078 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding the main thing was he could throw it for strikes early in the count
4353079 kuroda was mixing it up throwing sliders and curveballs mixed his fastball in and changed speeds on his fastball trying to keep hitters off balance
4353080 its tough man weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before
4353081 i believe i can do it i never thought i couldnt
4353082 when i went to first it didnt have anything to do with playing short for me short is just familiar
4353083 myers definitely was up to the task but their pitcher was good too
4353084 were all right i mean were a game back if you had asked me if i would take being a game back with 41 to play i would have said yes so theres no sense in us getting all bent out of shape
4353085 hey that guy was working the collectables vintage sale a few weeks ago
4353086 what do you want for the sewing machine and do i really have to make you an offer on the clothes
4353087 yeah i know your wife but i am only going to offer you 2 each on the clothing
4353088 a certain cure for ennui blue devils mopes horrors and dyspepsia
4353089 if you start doing that everything else can be broadened everyone can argue and say this is a matter of interest and therefore affects religion
4353090 that is why the government has always taken the view that you should not mix politics and religion
4353091 we would like to resume our approach of stemming the tendency of indian youths to enter crime by tackling the problem at school level
4353092 we should mellow problematic students by telling them how they should act for the betterment of their life
4353093 under the labour laws an officer who fails to turn up for work five days consecutively will have his service terminated automatically without notice
4353094 i dont think that just because uitm is in selangor he has the right to make such a proposal
4353095 those who question the position of uitm will have to walk over the gpms dead body first lets not tempt fate here shall we if the question now is whether the malay institution is being pressured the answer is no but if the question is whether there is a narrow political agenda the answer is yes
4353096 if they do it once more we should not be dayus weak to enforce the sedition act
4353097 to me it was important to have a drink that youre excited to drink just like when youre not pregnant you shouldnt have to miss out
4353098 a brand is what you get when you add differentiating substance to a product
4353099 a brand is what defines you as being different better than the competition and gives potential perfect customers reason to choose you a brand is giving a reason to choose
4353100 a brand is what you get when you add differentiating substance to a product
4353101 the dubious privilege of a freelance writer is hes given the freedom to starve anywhere
4353102 deer drive is an entirely different animal when it comes to hunting games
4353103 most hunting games are slow moving simulations with frustrating controls deer drive is all about shooting all about pick up and play fun and being a more accurate marksman and better hunter than your friends
4353104 oh man there are two record squirrels i know going through the boxes
4353105 i survived the wind storm at the fun forest 93 seattle center
4353106 kind of fascinating but you really just need a picture
4353107 problem parents are a big part of why so many teens smoke drink get drunk and abuse illegal and prescription drugs
4353108 when parents are not part of the solution they become part of the problem
4353109 perhaps we need to revive the old public service announcement that used to run on television its 10 p
4353110 i thought it was quite honestly kind of offensive to parents
4353111 there should be more energy put into busting the stigma around addiction than pointing fingers at parents
4353112 none of it worked until my daughter wanted it to work
4353113 i would say there are a higher percentage of parents who are not problems
4353114 kids think that because these are medicines that are prescribed they are safe
4353115 the problem is that there is very little difference between the amount they take for a high and the amount that causes an overdose
4353116 hey no tenemos plata pero le ofrecemos u s30 000 y empezaron a negociar hasta que la justicia dijo que deb an pagar si o si y sin demora
4353117 i think a lot of people wanted to come to the old stadium
4353118 youd sell a lot more hot dogs and hamburgers it basically works out all the same
4353119 probably 300 and the whole family could come for free
4353120 one of the local funeral homes has an advertising package
4353121 i think it should be more 390 people is not very many its not a very good average
4353122 i think haymarket fauquier need to do more to survive
4353123 were in northern virginia where theres a lot of competition with pulling in the fan base
4353124 some of the clubs down 81 just dont have the competition we do
4353125 i want to be just like boyd when i grow up
4353126 its going to be a fight theyre going to be ready for us were going to be ready for them
4353127 i had decent command of curveball and fastball when i needed it
4353128 defense was helping a lot its pretty good when you can get a groundball and it will turn into a double play for you
4353129 he was just unbelievable mikes been really good for us all year he just basically cruised to a win
4353130 it has been more than 4 years that i have been suffering from painful monthly periods and other abnormal symptoms attached to endometriosis
4353131 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4353132 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4353134 syndicated lending to indian borrowers has bucked global trends by going up by 18 per cent compared to the credit in the same period in 2007
4353135 tata motors 3 billion facility to finance the acquisition of jaguar and land rover is the largest indian loan so far in 2008 and is the third largest indian loan on record
4353136 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
4353137 this is not the time to do business with iran
4353138 it is time for the international community including our ally turkey to begin considering additional measures to pressure iran
4353139 increased tensions between iran and the us will put turkey in a very awkward position
4353140 after the iraq war turkey learned it could no longer remain indifferent to regional developments
4353141 has yet to request that turkey acts as a formal mediator
4353142 you can think about the what if what if what if
4353143 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4353144 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4353145 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4353146 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4353147 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4353148 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4353149 we asked georgia to participate in this platform our proposal for was also welcomed by russia
4353150 we want it to conduce to an economic cooperation we want it to lead to cooperation on regional peace and security
4353151 they asked me what the hell are you doing up there in oak ridge
4353152 i was like hello of course they used the n word what the hell do you think youre doing up there in oak ridge
4353153 youre up that program you cant run that program what the hell are you doing
4353154 then of course they went into the different racial slurs i was just stunned i was absolutely stunned
4353155 but when they started using one racial slur after another
4353156 i was like i cant believe im getting this phone call
4353157 why when i can stay home and spend time with my kids
4353158 when i hear bad talk about him its why or when im defending him why you have to love what you do
4353159 the games not a game anymore its about defending yourself it shouldnt be about that
4353160 i figured if i was going to play i had to not only know what i was supposed to do but i also knew what other guys were supposed to do
4353161 wed be at practice and id be telling other guys what they were supposed to be doing
4353162 the coaches really like that because all coaches like smart players
4353163 hes enthusiastic and he was a good player as we talked i knew he was knowledgeable about what we were asking him to do at bearden i was excited to have him as part of our staff hes one i had respected and liked as a player in oak ridge
4353164 i was disappointed to lose him after that one year he added a lot to a team that advanced pretty far
4353165 i figured if im going to teach and coach why not teach and coach in oak ridge
4353166 you get paid fairly well and what better program to coach than at oak ridge
4353167 the only job i had a shot to get if i was going to get one was austin east
4353168 there was never consideration that i could be a black head coach in east tennessee at a white school that never crossed my mind it didnt because id never seen it
4353169 youre getting ready to play a team and you read in the paper where the coach says well theyre really athletic i dont know if we can handle their athleticism
4353170 so we dont coach any we just roll the ball out there and say ok athletes you go get em were going to beat them because we have better athletes
4353171 stanton is a really really good football coach you dont win a state championship like he did at austin east without an idea of what youre doing
4353172 we won the state at austin east and the next year we lost in the first round of the playoffs and there were people at the game who made a point of saying i should be fired and the whole staff should be fired and in particular me and kwayu should go back to oak ridge
4353173 the fans in general oak ridge fans in general are hard on the coaches
4353174 you factor in the people who dont care whether im black or white who just dont think i can coach
4353175 those are the people who come up with the most outlandish things to say the craziest rumors
4353176 for people to think i would cut and run at the first sign of trouble do they not believe anything we tell the kids about oak ridge football
4353177 do they not believe it themselves do they think that a guy who played here who bled sweat played through injuries played through knee surgeries that im going to have a bad season and say oh well im going to quit im gone i cant handle this this is too much pressure
4353178 for them to think im going to cut and run is absolutely ridiculous this is my home i have no intention of leaving until i believe that im being led by god and not anybody else
4353179 if my administrators werent the kind of men that they are i wouldnt have a job if they were racist or bigoted at all i wouldnt have a job id be gone they would have let the influence of some of those people run me out of town
4353180 and the reason i might not have is sometimes you look at your place in the world and you look at where youre at sometimes you dont see the bigger picture
4353181 i like to think i would have but i dont know i like to hope that i would have because in the long run when you have a kid who comes up to you and says i want to be a coach because you are that touches you you know youre touching the kids lives but to have a player say youre a black head coach and because you are i think i can be that goes a long way that goes a long way
4353182 when you get a guy as cocky as stanton to rethink things about football something isnt right because he loves it
4353183 i called friends to try and get them to apply when stanton left
4353184 but it was im not going in that good ol boy place i said its austin east they said you still have to deal with good ol boy
4353185 they didnt want to get involved with that you have a lot of minority coaches in other metropolitan areas in tennessee and knoxville is considered a metropolitan area it unwillingness to deal with racism has to be a reason why
4353186 one of my favorite sayings keep it close you can beat them
4353187 with austin east they always say keep it close and you can beat them theyre going to get out coached in the end
4353188 people need to get out of the perception and start talking about the reality our practices are structured we go to this station and that station we sit here on sundays from this time to that time to try to put together a game plan to go out and play we do those things too a lot of people dont know that and understand that
4353189 i dont know if its fearful to them that i as a black man can have a mind and think and be able to decide and make a decision
4353190 im not lazy ask my wife ive got five kids i still have to cut the grass i still have to cut the grass and deal with those knuckleheads im part of the schools ptso
4353191 if you get out of the perception and into the reality thats the only way you can change this
4353192 i love coaching and i actually love teaching a lot this was my calling this was what god called me to do to be here at austin east at this time
4353193 there are certain negatives that come with the position of being the head coach regardless of the color you are
4353194 with that said with you being black in a predominantly white environment that does add a little more pressure to it as long as youre winning i think its safe to say people dont really care what color you are theyre going to jump on that bandwagon and ride it
4353195 once you start to slip a little bit and not operate to the standard in their minds or based on the tradition that oak ridge has or morristown has or whatever then people are going to criticize
4353196 morristown had never had a black head coach in their history but they stuck their head out there and basically allowed me to coach
4353197 so as far as that is concerned i cant say anything negative along those lines because it was a good situation
4353198 as much as ive tried to talk him out of it and i say that as a joke marcus was able to see his daddy and see what his daddy went through as a head coach
4353199 thats not saying anything negative its a life thats lonely at the top sometimes marcus saw that real close up what it was like and he wants to do it which i think he has a chance to be a good one
4353200 he really likes the game and studies it hard he really likes the people hes a good people person he does that a lot better than i do and hes a players coach thats what marcus wants to do and i think hell have a shot at doing that some day
4353201 how many certified black assistant coaches are really coming up through the ranks i really dont know it wouldnt surprise me at all if there werent that many in upper east tennessee or lower tennessee because coaches black and white are going down to georgia because of the money and the resources they have down there
4353202 but if you have an area where you have a good number of black athletes and every year theyre the stars of the team and you can never find a black coach a black assistant coach to me thats a problem
4353203 to me what youre saying is youre good enough to play on our team but thats it youre not good enough to do anything else youre only good enough to run the ball for us or catch the ball for us to me thats insulting
4353204 if we have a team and the team has 100 players on it and 25 or 30 are black why cant they have a black head coach
4353205 if you look at the percentage of black folks living in the major cities knoxville morristown the tri cities up there its 4 to 7 percent black population
4353206 if you get around cities with larger black populations youre going to see more black head coaches why is that so
4353207 i just dont know if this part of the country is really that comfortable right yet in trusting black head coaches to coach predominant white teams and having to deal with the administration and people of the community and so on
4353208 id paint them a different picture than i had coming into it
4353209 ill paint them the picture of it as if you want to be a coach these are some of the things you have to be ready for you have to be ready for people not liking you because they dont like any coach
4353210 and then you have to say i have to not only be ready for that but i have to be ready for the people who arent going to like me just because the color of my skin
4353211 people can say and theyll want to pretend that racism isnt that bad that some blacks use that as an excuse that its not about race anymore and if you do your job people will recognize that
4353212 im not saying that i think most white people think that way but there is enough of them who do that they make their presence known
4353213 i think everybodys pleased the start of the season is finally here
4353214 frank farina roar coach always prepares his sides well theyre a mobile team and a young team and theyll be tough
4353215 but i think if we can get on top of them then weve got the firepower to overcome them
4353216 everyone has had a good pre season and we want to take that form into the season
4353217 it hasnt been easy to pick the team but im sure the 15 that have been included will do the job for us
4353218 we played during the pre season cup and we know their strengths and weaknesses
4353219 ocz continues the trend of enabling consumers with the latest in cutting edge solid state disc technology with the introduction of the new core v2 ssd

4353225 the patchwork that theyve done on the road you get a dip or a rut in the flood plains and the trailers just follow the ruts very hard to keep them in your lane
4353226 we are working to progressively upgrade so as sections of the road need to be rehabilitated were constructing to those new standards
4353227 this is about aboriginal people saying well this is what we think of the intervention
4353228 people like mal brough and others have said all the women like it the intervention and the men dont that is not the case
4353229 the thing is we now see indigenous minister jenny macklin our new minister doing an agreement with cape york where these ideas sort of emanated from people quarantining and going through the system and what not
4353230 the whole thing was about this being dealt with with people who werent looking after their kids or were habitual drunks etc
4353231 they were the people who were to be targeted here we had the whole of the northern territory just one stroke of the pen and everyone was caught up in it
4353232 the government has committed itself to over 700 million in this area their commitment is there it will be rolled out soon
4353233 the minister only said that just a couple of weeks ago that you are looking at over 400 communities and you are going to have 400 responses
4353234 i challenge anyone in the cafe latte drinking set of sydney and everyone else if you have those sort of statistics in a suburb of sydney that you are not going to send the police in
4353235 ive not heard one woman complain about the intervention on the ground because they find themselves safe
4353236 there is a proposal obviously that the tunnel is fed from the western freeway thats the main through traffic and i support that tunnel going ahead and that access
4353237 i do believe that there should be an ability for local residents to access the tunnel without having to backtrack across the western freeway
4353238 whats been proposed however i dont think is able to be supported

4353254 a stubborn knot metaphorical or real requires patience and a very sharp tool
4353255 russo long felt that he was treated with less intellectual and financial regard by wfan than francesa
4353256 i think wfan realized i was lukewarm about making a long term commitment to them
4353257 they knew getting me to sign would be dicey i guess they didnt want a lame duck working with mike
4353258 thats it no goodbye shows no final shows no nothing look ive been there for a long time i loved the place i just feel this is the right move at the right time to take a blow and see whats out there
4353259 theres a plane load of asians on their way over
4353260 you never would have thought she would come up here and cut loose like that
4353261 going against the rules and soooo unfair to all these other talented karaoke loving canadians who had waited patiently
4353262 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4353263 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4353264 da in dieser angelegenheit bis heute keine gesetzlichen regelungen vorhanden sind betrachten wir das ganze als rechtliche grauzone
4353265 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4353266 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4353267 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4353268 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble thats what im trying to do
4353269 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
4353270 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement

4353287 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4353288 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality
4353289 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4353290 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4353291 the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4353292 we believe this is clearly a further example of administrative activity orchestrated by the other shareholders in tnk bp
4353293 i will continue to manage the company on a daily basis to help shareholders to overcome their disagreements
4353294 in fact speculative non commercial trading accounted for nearly half of the oil trading on the new york mercantile exchange
4353295 it had been incorrectly classifying a significant number of non commercial trades carried out by a single large trader as commercial
4353296 after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4353297 appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4353298 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4353299 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4353300 have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4353301 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4353302 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4353303 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his life style his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4353304 they just want to do it closer to home to save costs
4353305 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4353306 its reflective of whats going on in the rest of the country
4353307 in the short term the katy freeway may have a little indigestion but theyre a good demand generator
4353308 anybody trying to develop a hotel these days is having a hard time finding financing
4353309 you can bet thats going to be dislocating to the economy
4353310 honestly after yesterday i dont know what or how or why but someone was looking out for me and i got the fantastic opportunity to swim the final
4353311 initially when i thought i wasnt in it was very difficult but then luckily for me i got another opportunity so it wasnt too difficult to recover after that because i was just so thankful that i was in there and had a lane
4353312 im so thankful for that because in athens i never got another opportunity so to come out there i just really wanted to give it my absolute all
4353313 i wanted to be hurting right at the end of it and i definitely did that full credit to britta she swam a fantastic race and i know how hard we have to work to get to where we are right now and to have four one hundredths separating us its not much but thats what the racings about
4353314 i really tried to focus on my own race i just wanted to get to that wall
4353315 we are watching and we see the clips and so on but were focusing on the teams performances and in assisting our athletes
4353316 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4353317 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4353318 i have these sort of flashbacks forward they tell me little bits and pieces to help me figure out exactly whats happened and sort of what kind of state shes going to be in kind of operating a little bit in the gray areas much more so with the flash forward stuff its challenging
4353319 i think shes kind of idealistic when she goes into the job and i dont think she realizes exactly how much shes going to have to sacrifice from her own personal life and how challenged shes going to be and how much shes going to be changed i think she probably thinks she can be the same person as she was at the beginning and its really not the case at all because its such a huge mammoth amount of job pattys such a mercurial kind of demanding boss who she is kind of in awe of its much bigger than she thinks
4353320 glenn is a natural presence and commands respect obviously but from her body of work and everything like that and being a young actress ive grown up admiring her always so thats absolutely a natural thing that i would bring into the part but shes always very sweet and an angel and lovely its definitely a dynamic and as a young actress seeing how she works and how she communicates with the directors and how she gets to where she gets to its very educational for me and fun we have fun
4353321 two guys trying to buy alcohol to impress girls third guy gets the fake id with mclovin on it goes off with the cops that was always the same the real evolution was the relationship between the guys i think in our first draft a lot of criticism we heard was that the characters were very much alike seth and evan were kind of similar its not like were totally different guys so we really had a hard time wrapping our heads around how do we make another guy but slowly we kind of developed with a lot of help and advice from judd apatow thats where that came from we developed the relationship and kind of emotional story between the guys
4353322 i think that was a good indication that we maintained good relationships with everyone we went to high school with pretty much everyone signed the release and we knew all of them still a few bastards didnt but theyve known since high school that we were writing this movie we told everyone all the names we told people hey we used your name in our movie it was really weird when we were finally 10 years later like its actually happening but everyone seems psyched 30 of our friends are coming to the premiere from vancouver so yeah yeah thatll be fun
4353323 actual experiences yeah we tried to get liquor a lot
4353324 there was a guy actually the guy who plays the bartender at baileys is the guy whos charged with the task i mean every bottle of alcohol you see in the movie is fake and in the liquor store theres literally thousands of fake bottles of alcohol because no actual alcohol would clear their name for usage there was papsmear gin that was the one that really made us laugh and there was trotskys vodka with a picture of trotsky on it like binyans beer old muskogee yeah it was the guy i honestly cant remember his name dr label or something i cant remember but the guy who plays the bartender
4353325 i mean career wise its made everything go much more smoothly i would say but my actual day to day life maybe four people ask to take pictures with me every day that occupies maybe two and a half minutes so i dont consider that life changing really two minute changing but no nothings really changed it hasnt affected my halo score
4353326 im going to go work with ridley scott and russell crowe in morocco on an untitled film
4353327 its between chatter penetration or body of lies its not about sex its about politics in the middle east and its really good
4353328 its a throwback to the political films that i enjoyed in the 70s
4353329 certainly its reminiscent of films like the parallax view and three days of the condor and id love to be a part of more films like that
4353330 if i tell you about the plot it sounds usual suspect
4353331 but take my word for it its a great book it takes place in dubai washington and morocco im going back to morocco for the fourth time
4353332 i love when its a good enough story and it has a great narrative in it and its gonna be a good film first and foremost im a huge advocate for making those types of movies
4353333 thats why blood diamond was huge on my radar why i jumped at that opportunity and certainly this film with ridley
4353334 were still circling and deciding ill leave a lot to him and say what do you want to do do you want to go thin glamorous fat do you want to eat too much or eat very little
4353335 you give the audience a long list thats absolutely definitive as to who this character must be but for the most part thats bullsh what i think makes crowe most engaging is that he can fit into anything its the same with leo
4353336 this is the way that people are educated about issues nowadays this is the main avenue for learning in todays world
4353337 i would just hope that enough people go to see them so the studios will be encouraged to make more films like that in the future and that there is an audience for them and they are profitable
4353338 cloud computing is officially the new overhyped it fad but it could lead to some stormy times ahead
4353339 now that everyone gets that open source works and its a mainstream technology how do we up our game
4353340 data warehousing appliance vendor and recent microsoft corp acquisition datallegro inc s ceo stuart frost responded to the patent
4353341 almost any media or file system that can be recognized in mac os x
4353342 data warehousing appliance vendor and recent microsoft corp acquisition datallegro inc s ceo stuart frost responded to the patent
4353343 you cant hear it so you dont know its there
4353344 if you had a cray supercomputer and a month and a half
4353345 ive heard record company employees tell me that if their copy is lost and turns up on the internet it will get hunted down and they will lose their job
4353346 cloud computing is officially the new overhyped it fad but it could lead to some stormy times ahead
4353347 the biggest benefit is that we can link clinicians at physical sites without having them go to the site there are just huge demands on their time meanwhile patients get a range of clinicians on their case providing their medical expertise
4353348 we didnt have sufficient money to refurbish the rooms and it worked out well
4353349 if you have appleworks documents you can give them a brand new home in numbers
4353350 data warehousing appliance vendor and recent microsoft corp acquisition datallegro inc s ceo stuart frost responded to the patent
4353351 our goal was to establish a set of standards for our application development community around the middleware and tools that we use
4353352 that work led to the development of a set of shared technology services that now underlie all of the applications developed here
4353353 these kinds of things are just available to our developers
4353354 so they need to write zero lines of code to provide them
4353355 but its really a tribute to a lot of hard work by a lot of very good people here at schneider over the past few years it really was a team accomplishment
4353356 that san jose state game offensive coordinator david shaw said this month
4353357 what i want is for us to be able to run more effectively than we did last year coach jim harbaugh said
4353358 were going to have a good line to do it behind and weve got those two backs that are darn good
4353359 if im a little sore one day maybe lighten it up a little bit gerhart noted
4353360 or in terms of a game if its third and one and ive got 5 or 6 yards go down dont do unnecessary stuff its kind of hard my personality is to keep going but youve got to worry about the season in the long run and not just one play
4353361 when guys come up to tackle him they dont know what theyre in for quarterback tavita pritchard said
4353362 i felt kind of like i was back in high school the game slowed down gerhart said
4353363 i tried to help out the younger guys more said gerhart who played all 12 games as a freshman in 2006
4353364 i tried to become like a coach i stayed in the game even though i couldnt participate myself
4353365 they said even after you have a good pcl surgery its still going to move so basically learn to play with it gerhart said
4353366 theyre going to show up and yall are going to be pleased by what you see
4353367 god willing starting by the middle of 2009 the power crisis on java and bali will begin to be overcome
4353368 the widest possible opportunity to private companies to participate in the construction and operation
4353369 it really isnt any different to james blunt and its not nearly as good
4353370 the consultants have suggested about five to six hectares is probably sort of the right size but indeed on the entire site there are up to 25 hectares of land will be set aside
4353371 including an end of system flow objective of 99 per cent of pre development flows
4353372 however the plan does not place restrictions on how the water is used once it has been taken
4353373 works can also be reconfigured subject to there being no increase in overall take
4353374 had prof kingsford discussed these issues with nrw officers he may have reached completely different conclusions to those contained in his report
4353375 i would argue that youre actually increasing the take of overland flow because as you do that you draw down on the swamp theyre calling it a dam because youre diverting water into storage and then putting it on a crop
4353376 from an ecological point of view that water would have sat there servicing an ecological function so essentially theyre still taking water from the paroo for irrigation
4353377 this was proven recently in the landmark murray darling basin commission report on the health of the basins river system
4353378 a good water citizen by managing water flows through to nsw
4353379 the queensland government should provide a transparent explanation given that identical approval processes occur on other rivers
4353380 we are seeking further information about this issue under freedom of information legislation and may call upon the queensland government to decommission the development
4353381 the paroo river has been recently identified by the csiro as the only healthy river in the murray darling basin
4353382 that is a factor that cannot be overlooked by the government
4353383 what we have to ensure that tariff reduction occurs in a way which will be matched by achievements in terms of improved export prospects in other markets and the collapse of those wto negotiations has an impact on that objective
4353384 i think that they didnt take into account the fact that the doha round collapsed they havent taken into account the fact that the european union have maintained their tariffs at 10 per cent
4353385 that said however well weigh up the report in its totality and the benefit that it delivers to the industry
4353386 ive long argued that all of the subsidies going to the australian vehicle manufacturers should be tied to vehicle fuel efficiency to recognise that consumers want smaller more fuel efficient cars because the price of fuel is being driven by overall oil prices and that may continue to go up
4353387 the rudd governments overriding imperative should be to make every single vehicle on australias roads more efficient than they are
4353388 the australian automotive industry should stand or fall on its own two feet through its own efforts and they shouldnt be cowering behind a tariff protection wall and they shouldnt be waiting for governments to invest 2 billion of the taxpayers money in them
4353389 the government will respond to those ideas in due course
4353390 this is a high quality report that deserves thoughtful consideration and a quality response
4353391 our aim will be to achieve the best possible social and economic outcomes not just for today or tomorrow but for the long term
4353392 the government cannot pretend this is steve bracks report and not theirs the fact is they hand picked mr bracks to write the report they wanted
4353393 that san jose state game offensive coordinator david shaw said this month
4353394 what i want is for us to be able to run more effectively than we did last year coach jim harbaugh said
4353395 were going to have a good line to do it behind and weve got those two backs that are darn good
4353396 if im a little sore one day maybe lighten it up a little bit gerhart noted

4353405 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4353406 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4353407 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4353408 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4353409 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4353430 hecht hill lancaster the films production company wanted to lose money because they were making so much money from their other pictures they wanted to shoot half of it and then put it on the shelf and take a tax loss their tax man said you cant do that you have to finish it and show it one time and then take your tax loss i made the whole thing for 5 000 i would have done it for nothing because it was my first starring role so i made it then bam everything happened they never expected it to be a hit
4353431 it was one of the best without a doubt director sam peckinpah wasnt that kind of a character people made him out to be sure he took his occasional snort im sure and of course he drank and if he didnt like you you were gone i remember one day we were coming back from having lunch we had just finished all the stuff leading up to the fight at the end he had his head down and i said what are you thinking sam he said im worried stiff i said about what you have a heck of a picture so far he said im worried about all of this shooting the shootout at the finale i told him sam let it all hang out he looked up at me and said this is what im going to do we had never seen anything like it before it was amazing

4353451 but the economic tide has well and truly turned against this plant
4353452 because of a combination of factors completely beyond the control of the company or our staff this value add dimension has been severely reversed
4353453 resource costs have increased up to 14 percent and we have also experienced significantly higher fuel costs and transport surcharges
4353454 paradoxically we can obtain significantly better returns for our unprocessed casings than putting them through what is intended to a value add operation
4353455 rather than adding value our centralised processing facility incurs costs which are unsustainable

4353460 its very very difficult on a lot of people it will basically shut down the community for a few days especially around the funeral time
4353461 i was at home this evening and one of my sister in laws came in and told me about it it was my niece actually that came upon the accident and had to identify the individuals there and she works for them so it was very tragic for her as well
4353462 we cant really determine what the cause of the collision is at this time
4353463 our reconstructionist is on the scene and hes gathering all the information that he can so that we can try and make a determination as to what happened
4353464 were going to wait and find out what any autopsy or investigation can tell us
4353465 one stopped and actually went into the dugout and pulled one of the victims out of the car and brought him to shore
4353466 theres going to be a lot of people that will need counselling and probably other kinds of help
4353467 weve never had anything like this in the history of our town
4353468 there is no safe passage for him now he is asking for safe passage after selling out pakistans sovereignty
4353469 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack
4353470 the latest information on civilian casualties in gori tskhinvali and surrounding areas calls into question whether the forces are respecting that obligation
4353471 victims of the attack described to human rights watch how they saw numerous small explosions within seconds before they fell to the ground
4353472 some of them had been hit by rockets most likely fired from grad launchers weapons that should not be used in areas populated by civilians as they cannot be directed at only military targets and are therefore inherently indiscriminate
4353473 we burned these houses we want to make sure that they the georgians cant come back because if they do come back this will be a georgian enclave again and this should not happen
4353474 two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
4353475 people are continuing to arrive in north ossetia by the busload and many civilians are wounded

4353528 speculation is going to go on for the next three or four weeks and i could talk about every player we are linked with
4353529 some of them would be yes some would be no and some i would never have heard of and it would just be agents trying to drum up interest in their players as the window comes to a close
4353530 id rather not get into individuals because i think its a waste of time
4353531 when weve got some signings the media can have a chat to them
4353532 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4353533 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4353534 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4353535 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4353536 i think the experience of taking part in three olympics helped
4353537 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4353538 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4353539 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4353540 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4353541 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4353542 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4353543 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4353544 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4353545 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4353546 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4353547 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4353548 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4353549 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4353550 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4353551 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4353552 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4353553 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4353554 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4353555 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4353556 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4353557 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4353558 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4353559 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4353560 all youve got to do is e mail her with your most personal and creative response as to why you wish to be included in such an awesome treat and you will be entered for a chance to win this smashing baby once in a lifetime opportunity

4353566 what can i do for huge profits but work part time
4353567 who else wants to discover the astonishing step by step secrets of how to play acoustic guitar like the eagles jack johnson joni mitchell ben harper james taylor jewell and so on
4353568 he played admirably through three and a half quarters most of the time it was just one thing here or there during inopportune times wed turn the football over some of it was his responsibility and some of it wasnt but hes the one who shouldered the blame for the whole deal
4353569 he didnt play perfect it wasnt carelessness it was out of eagerness to be successful and trying to do his part but there are a lot of reasons for interceptions sometimes they definitely fall on the quarterback but its a team sport it could be a wrong route a tipped ball or a broken protection we learned last year that everybody is accountable for our lack of success
4353570 ok web just dont think about it and itll go away
4353571 i have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had life separate from the mother that it became an individual person and it always has therefore seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed
4353572 a divine ordinance which it is not our prerogative to hinder or ignore
4353573 it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a helper who shall be with him
4353574 w hoever would be a true christian must grant that this saying of god is true and believe that god was not drunk when he spoke these words and instituted marriage
4353575 for it is not a matter of free choice or decision but a natural and necessary thing that whatever is a man must have a woman and whatever is a woman must have a man
4353576 we were all created to do as our parents have done to beget and rear children this is a duty which god has laid upon us commanded and implanted in us as is proved by our bodily members our daily emotions and the example of all mankind
4353577 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
4353578 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected
4353579 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men
4353580 we are talking with hearts about both players i know calum elliot is a good player and that inverness are interested but livingston is much closer to edinburgh and we hope that will be a factor for him im confident of bringing him to the club and we will keep talking to hearts its the same situation with anthony
4353581 i think for calum it is necessary to have some change in his life to take more experience calum is a talented player but at the moment for his development and also for hearts its very important now to maybe loan this player to be more confident in a new club then after that well bring him back
4353582 it is certainly a tremendous honor to be recognized by the aurora awards committee for the work on the green dream home
4353583 a lot of hard work went into the planning and building of this home and it could not have been done without a true team effort from everyone involved
4353584 we wanted a program that would teach our kids in a fun way to conserve and be respectful of nature this area is a breeding ground or nursery for all of the areas marine life everything starts out here and we teach the children to have fun in the water but still be respectful of the creatures that live here
4353585 this is so much fun my husband michael is very interested in marine life and he thought this would be educational but still fun for our son joshua im so glad we came this is fascinating
4353586 the parents often bring their children here thinking it is something just for young people
4353587 they soon find that they are having as much fun collecting shells and looking for baby shrimp as their kids are
4353588 this particular pipefish is green from the algae and grasses present in the water
4353589 this pipefish can now hide easily from predators he is now wearing his own camouflage vest i guess you can say one small fact about the pipefish is that the males produce the babies
4353590 i have to live with this for the rest of my life
4353591 ive learned my lesson and my heart goes out to her family no time that i will do will bring kris back i didnt want this to happen and i didnt do it on purpose
4353592 she was a beautiful bright intelligent young woman with goals in life
4353593 danielle fisher took that all away kristin will never accomplish her goals danielle still has her whole life ahead of her no matter how much prison time she serves
4353594 i want fisher to spend as much time in prison as she can because she is going to get out
4353595 she might be sorry shes sorry about the lifestyle she doesnt have anymore i think shes sorry that her freedom was taken away
4353596 my brother did not know he was going to get life because we did not tell him
4353597 he is not a bad person and there was no proper investigation done
4353598 they said originally there was not enough money to do it so im not sure what theyre driving at here
4353599 i think this is a strong commitment from a very reputable developer and it further reinforces my opinion that they would be the best one for the job
4353600 its hard to argue with giving us 2 5 million up front and building what we have asked them to for 40 million
4353601 with no additional funding necessary by the cmpa or the city of pensacola
4353602 we plan to get as much out of that 40 million as we possibly can and if there are any cost savings we will apply them to the second portion of phase one
4353603 i think this proposal by trinity addresses the concerns expressed by dr beitsch as to whether the master developer proposals were bringing anything to the table
4353604 i think this certainly brings significant assets to the table i am very encouraged by it and trinity was identified by our consultant as the stronger of the two
4353605 id rather pay for tires wearing out than tires dry rotting on vehicles driven less than 5 000 miles a year
4353606 he has had an amazing life and he has continued to do great things the air force academy notre dame for architecture school three olympics hes a guy to look up to in every aspect of life
4353607 i tried to make it twice in swimming hadnt made it and it was starting to become an important goal in my life
4353608 it was either an assignment in turkey or training in san antonio
4353609 carter came in and told us were not going to the olympics
4353610 you cant go through that without being bitter about it its something you lived and breathed for years and years and years and someone took it away from you
4353611 you say yeah i may be 32 but ill come back in 84 and ill have my big chance but its hard in sports you dont get many opportunities and that was my chance i didnt know it at the time but that was my chance

4353845 establishing a nonreligious memorial at which all people could commemorate the war dead together
4353846 i pledge in front of the souls of the war dead to realize a war free and nuclear weapon free world based on the principle of the war renouncing japanese constitution which is managed through international concord not through retaliation and threat and which respects liberty and human rights
4353847 we need to find out what the japanese people think about it i do not think the time to take some actions on the issue has come
4353848 they are proud of their roots but they dig liverpool too and thought they would kick it off there

4353859 remember when i got you a date with those hot blind girls
4353860 yeah i remember that everything went great until the seeing eye dog went crazy and bit my nuts
4353861 she thought you were the refrigerator he was going to open the door for her

4353864 then i accept but when i need a favor i need you to be there for me
4353865 the chinese had figured out how to upset their gymnastics dynasty churning out these little athletic machines perhaps so young they couldn t even sense the pressure of the moment
4353866 what kills the karolyis isn t that the chinese would risk the health of their children by throwing them out here before their bones and muscles mature its that the americans wont allow the karolyis to do it too
4353867 it feels good i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4353868 i couldnt get him off and it was really starting to make both me and my mom very irritated

4353871 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4353872 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4353873 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4353874 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4353875 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
4353876 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
4353877 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
4353878 like you we also want to improve to make a change
4353879 we see the returns from residential property being above pretty well all other asset classes in risk adjusted terms
4353880 we see the next six to 12 months as a period of softness in sydney and nationally but the overall fundamentals will continue to tighten
4353881 the gap between supply of residential property and demand will support the market
4353882 this gap is set to get bigger over the coming years as pent up demand becomes more acute and the population continues to expand
4353883 could rise by up to 40 per cent over the next four years
4353884 we dont believe australian property prices will fall particularly and certainly not on a sustained basis as weve seen in the us
4353885 rental yields are increasing incredibly which makes being in property now a good opportunity
4353886 it also means that when things do take off you are already there you arent competing with hundreds of others
4353887 im biased towards property as an investment but its more important than ever to look at it as a long term investment
4353888 there are no quick bucks to be made and anyone who tells you otherwise has an ulterior motive but with super and shares savaged now is a good time to secure property for a rental income
4353889 rents are around 320 a week for a bashed up two bedroom house so yields are great plus theres a lot of migrant population growth and good infrastructure
4353890 its a good time to invest as you can take a long time to do your research and consider every opportunity on its merits as theres not too much competition
4353891 with a 5 per cent rental return the costs of ownership can be minimal
4353892 the rental yields are very good because the demand for them is very high because there arent many buyers around you can make some cheeky offers and have a lot of room to manoeuvre
4353893 plus interest rates are almost guaranteed not to go up during 2008 and with the latest retail spending figures so low they might even come down in the future
4353894 but bricks and mortar feel like a much sounder investment
4353895 we thought this would be a good investment for the long term
4353896 its a gorgeous looking house and theres always lots of demand in this area for rentals
4353897 before you had to buy a property outright for the super fund
4353898 but now a self managed super fund can borrow to purchase an asset anywhere from 60 per cent to 75 per cent of the value of the property
4353899 i think its a very good scheme for certain people
4353900 you can do comparisons from a financial point of view
4353901 but you have to be careful a financial planner might be loath to tell you to go into property because they mightnt get commission on the purchase in the same way they might for shares
4353902 a lot of people have been burnt by the sharemarket and see property as a much more reliable safety net

4353934 i am immensely proud of this excellent set of results
4353935 jfs school is optimistic that we have another outstanding set of examination results with a particularly high number of top grades
4353936 i am delighted with these results which show a significant improvement since last year this is a tribute to the hard work of all the students and their teachers in terms of value added which shows how much extra the school has given to the students our score is again very high and this is a tremendous achievement

4353938 a receipt in hebrew is a kabbalah yes the very same kabbalah madonna is into the word means the receiving im into kabbalah to make sure i dont lose out on my expenses but the dual use of the word might explain why madonna drinks 20 a bottle kabbalah water maybe one day she was in jerusalem and asked a chasidic jewish taxi driver for a kabbalah and he whisked her off to safed home of the religious movement and it got too embarrassing to explain
4353939 it takes something special to fill the gap left by danny in the summer and this is it mitch winehouse is a listener to and friend of the station were delighted hes agreed to a show the other side of the microphone for a change
4353940 it was very promising we should be a very competitive
4353941 i can see potential in the squad and overall the fitness levels looked good i have set the lads a challenging target for this year but am confident we have the resources to achieve the goals set

4353947 as we get more data and complete sequencing of full genomes we find new ways of looking at issues
4353948 were looking a lot fitter than last year we play a stringent system and everyone has a role to play
4353949 i want to see better commitment from the players as we used 68 last season
4353950 every diplomat from anywhere in the world is welcome in hebron but the british chose to come escorted by a provocative anti israeli anti jewish organisation
4353951 this organisation is acting against israel as a jewish state so some people demonstrated their opinion i can understand why they demonstrated against this antisemitic event
4353952 when we arrived in hebron one of the settlers noticed me and got out of his car after blocking our vehicle he began filming us and kicked the car we tried to drive out of the way but he followed us and blocked us again
4353953 by this point he had called some friends and they also gathered around us the settler claimed we had tried to run over his foot but this was not the case
4353954 its hard to say how dangerous it was because settler violence towards anyone they do not want in the region has grown significantly recently
4353955 there is always a danger of it escalating and we were fortunate nothing major happened the diplomats were a bit shaken up they got a taste of what is happening in hebron at the moment
4353956 the israeli police intervened and we are assisting them with their investigation
4353957 we just get more excited about the show the closer it gets the line up looks really good at the moment and we know it is going to be a really good night
4353958 to see people and performers of such professionalism and such big names give up their time to help the cause is just great
4353959 lancashire constabulary will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4353960 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4353961 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4353962 in cases where death occurs there will always be an expectation that a severe sentence will result
4353963 however where there is a low level of fault and significant mitigating factors a community sentence may be more appropriate of course where the facts of the case indicate a custodial sentence is appropriate the courts will act accordingly
4353964 as venues offering thoroughly gendered entertainment similar in nature to sex cinemas or peep shows lap dancing clubs need to be recognised regulated and licensed for what they are part of the commercial sex industry not the ordinary leisure industry
4353965 tinkering with legislation primarily designed to regulate cafes and karaoke bars is not the vehicle for this neither is relying on planning controls
4353966 instead the only viable solution is to allow local authorities to licence lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments venues that provide visual sexual entertainment
4353967 zelo sem razo aran na oi v atenah sem sicer zadel osmico v zadnjem strelu vendar tedaj stoje le e to ni mogo e poleg tega sem imel v zadnji seriji izjemne strele prihranil sem si dovolj asa da sem lahko pro il po asi vse mi je lo gladko do estdesetega strela ki je odletel v spodnjo desno stan tar e pri municiji se lahko zgodi da je naboj slab e polnjen ali pa ima okvaro vendar je to izjemno redko koda to se mi je primerilo prav na oi in sem zaradi tega ostal brez finala toda tudi e bi se vanj uvrstil z zadnjo stotico ne bi imel mo nosti da bi osvojil odli je za tretjim mestom sem zaostajal za dva kroga in ker je finalni nastop za razliko od kvalifikacij ki so bile na prostem potekal v zaprtem prostoru razlike ne bi mogel nadoknaditi
4353968 to je bila velika smola saj je rajmond lepo kontroliral polo aj vse do zadnjega strela na elektronski tar i smo nato preverili kam je priletel naboj da bi lahko morebiti podali prito bo strel je priletel na mejo na 8 4 kar se je videlo na podlagi koda da je finalni nastop padel zaradi naboja mogo e je bila okvara na krogli
4353969 we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4353970 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4353971 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls
4353972 these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4353973 the system is therefore clearly failing thousands of older people
4353974 it is unacceptable for them to be treated any differently our recent darzi review sets out a framework for improving the quality of care for everybody that uses the nhs
4353975 a lot of progress has been made already with the treatment and care of older people but we recognise more can be done
4353976 vedela sem da sem v zaklju ku zmogla dovolj mo i za pospe evanje nisem elela tvegati eprav bi se lahko v polfinale uvrstila po asu elela sem zanesljivo potrditev udele be v naslednjem teku in zato osvojitev najmanj tretjega mesta tek je bil malce hitrej i kot sem pri akovala vendar ne gre pozabiti da so v vsej moji karieri v tej sezoni na 800 m dale najbolj i povpre ni asi prav zato pri akujem da bo polfinalna tekma izjemno hitra in bom morala za finale dose i as blizu osebnega rekorda ali pa ga celo izbolj ati
4353977 danes res ni bil moj dan po eni strani je lo vse narobe po drugi pa sem e butast in sam delal napake naredil sem slab obrat se med plavanjem zaletel v progo in slabo pri el v cilj s tem plavanjem tudi phelps ne bi pri el v finale
4353978 elja je bil nastop v finalu in boj za medaljo v eraj sem dokazal da tja tudi sodim sam izid danes ni bil slab saj je bil to moj drugi izid v karieri
4353979 morda sem malce prehitro za ela ker sem elela preve in na koncu me je malo zmanjkalo nastop je bil popolnoma nekaj drugega od tistega v eraj v eraj sem plavala nekako spro eno danes pa v kr u saj je lo v polfinalu e zares
4353980 v obeh disciplinah sem dosegla dr avna rekorda posebej sem zadovoljna z dose kom na 200 hrbtno saj si pred sezono nisem mislila da bom tri sekunde hitrej a od izidov ki sem jih plavala v zadnjih letih elja je bil tudi polfinale
4353981 no es lo ideal tampoco quiero ser pesimista s me gust mucho mi equipo pero nos falt el segundo gol nos falt contragolpear y nos falt no dejarnos sentar tanto siempre es mejor corregir con las victorias que con las derrotas
4353982 me gust porque nos presentamos con autoridad siempre con la intenci n de ir a atacar el arco contrario tuvimos mucha solidez en la defensa pero nos sigue faltando eso segundo gol nos pas lo mismo ante cruz azul monterrey y contra toluca tenemos que meter el segundo gol o tercero para manejar el partido de una mejor manera afortunadamente la defensa se mostr serena con seguridad y pudimos sacar la victoria ya encontramos el camino y vamos en ascenso
4353983 es normal que siempre ante chivas ofrezcan prima doble nosotros no necesitamos de eso para ganar nosotros tendremos nuestro propio incentivo que es el orgullo por ganar con tecos pas lo mismo les ofrecieron primas pero a nosotros no nos tienen que dar algo para ganar
4353984 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4353985 si nous voulons nous permettre de critiquer nos confr res il nous faut tre irr prochables
4353986 i think we live in a time when what is true can be made to seem a lie
4353987 and what is lie can be made to seem true and i think that the successful manipulation of those things have characterized several of our past elections that level of hubris and arrogance has got us in the mess that were in right now and were in a mess but if we subvert the best things that were about in the name of protecting our freedoms if we remove them then who are we becoming you know who are we you know the american idea is a beautiful idea it needs to be preserved served protected and sung out sung out on a nightly basis thats what im going to try to do
4353988 younis al ahmed is trying to go under the umbrella of the syrians as a way to unite the baathists
4353989 douri deeply distrusts working with the syrians because he distrusts the iranians who are strong allies with syria

4353991 after a night of simple birthday celebration simple manual labor unloading
4353992 no doubt he was shooting at americans not so long ago but the tide has turned and abu reisha knew how to reach an accommodation with the real order of power
4353993 at a time when americas standing in the middle east is extremely low the saudis are actually embracing us we should count our blessings
4353994 just do the top they cant even see the bottom from the street the only way they can see it is if they get up on a ladder
4353995 hey we are out of sandpaper for the hand sander
4353996 quickly do it by hand and then paint over it fast
4353997 i dont know what im doing here i want to paint but nobody likes what i do so no ones ever going to buy my stuff which means im stuck with these dead end jobs that pay nothing so i cant ever get enough money up together to
4353998 the god force cant mail you a cheque from the clouds
4353999 had we not gone to war we would probably by now be dealing with a nuclear iraq a heavily chemical iraq and moreover an iraq that governed the imagination of all the region
4354000 we would be sitting here agonising over whether we need to align with iran which is going nuclear against an iraq which is going nuclear or with iraq against iran and that is a strategic defeat for us either way
4354001 as far as non violent means goes yes but it would be very difficult for the united states to initiate kinetic action
4354002 hand them a series humiliating strategic defeats externally and work to undermine them internally
4354003 if you do this now and you do this effectively and you do it aggressively and decisively you will not have to go to war with iran if we fail to do that in the near future then were going to face a much larger war and we will then have to think seriously about going directly into iran
4354004 only if what we do is placed in the framework of a fundamental assault on the survival of the regime will it have a pick up among ordinary iranians
4354005 if we start shooting we must be prepared to fire the last shot dont shoot a bear if youre not going to kill it
4354006 being in basra the british had a major role to play and they didnt really play it very well
4354007 under british presence the iranians extended their power considerably british troops are still there but iraqis see them as dead men walking everybodys looking towards who is the real power that fills the vacuum and that then translates into an iranian american confrontation in that area
4354008 it frees our hand to deal aggressively with their irans structures once we have responsibility for that area well have to do what we need to do and that could well mean troops on the ground
4354009 i wouldnt have done the war that way i think a lot of us wouldve wished that we wouldve recognised a government in exile ahead of time gone in minimal occupation minor time period quickly turned over power to an iraqi government once and for all and left with a fairly powerful over the shadow horizon
4354010 think small and youll get small you might as well think big because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain
4354011 best friend cant be there for me at a time when i really needed my
4354012 argues that the religious core values of middle america have potentially disastrous consequences for both the united states and the planet
4354013 the irony is that the christian right will work with whoever will agree with their position will criticise some islamic regimes for their human rights records or the way they apply sharia law but will vote with them and enlist their support when it comes to anti gay measures issues of abortion and stem cell research
4354014 during this time i taught preached and believed in the bible literally including creationism
4354015 the others detained were three americans who were acting as support and to ensure the safety of the climbers and engage with the authorities
4354016 as an experience rock climber and mountaineer phil learned about the injustices in tibet through the climbing community
4354017 last year phil was horrified to learn that tibetan refugees had been shot and killed by chinese border authorities as they crossed nangpala pass in an attempt to flee to nepal
4354018 the shootings were captured on tape by climbers at cho oyu base camp on mount everest
4354019 it was at that time when phil decided to get involved with the tibetan freedom movement and realised he could use his climbing skills in his effort to support the tibetan people
4354020 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4354021 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
4354022 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and we are seeking further details
4354023 obviously youre always worried when your child is arrested especially abroad but we are also very proud of what he is doing for the tibetan people i am very pleased he is highlighting their plight
4354024 china seems so normal when you watch the olympics on television but you cant say what you want to say there
4354025 i know he practised beforehand to make sure they would be as safe as possible they wanted to do the protest peacefully but it is always a worry
4354026 ordinary outgoing person who loves climbing and is passionate about the tibetan cause
4354027 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4354028 when bush made his speech promising humanitarian aid everybody started whooping cheering high fiving
4354029 georgia was part of russia for 200 years and what saakashvili was doing in south ossetia threatened the stability of the whole north caucasus
4354030 i came in about 10 15pm and there were police officers outside and they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4354031 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van
4354032 its really worrying that its so close its like oh my god who is it you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
4354033 we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done for a very long time
4354034 i cant make any further comment until i know more about the incident
4354035 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4354036 lancashire constabulary will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4354037 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4354038 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4354039 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4354040 one does not want to be a snob but if the bridge is toll free or even cheap the ile de r will cease to be the ile de r
4354041 i am trying to sell while the prices remain high i am not the only one
4354042 we have a pearl here an atlantic pearl but it can only be preserved if we think clearly and work together
4354043 if you go down to the harbour at saint martin de r in the summer the quays are like the platforms of the paris m tro at rush hour you are lucky if you are not elbowed into the water
4354044 if even more people are encouraged to come to the island whats going to happen a certain kind of quality of life will disappear the issue is often portrayed as the rich islanders trying to keep the less rich at bay in france we are fated to be stuck for ever in 1789 but not everyone who lives in r is rich
4354045 any fair solution should involve the islanders paying something to use the bridge as well
4354046 otherwise it will be too easy to portray us as simply rich and selfish
4354047 the money must be used to create a proper system of public transport so visitors will be able to leave their cars on the other side of the bridge
4354048 there are many more independent and selective schools in the south than the north
4354049 i certainly had experience of the lower aspirations of parents in much of the north east and there is nothing like parental aspiration for helping to improve a level performance
4354050 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap between different areas of the country the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas
4354051 weve realised that aiming for the highest is going to help us at first we were probably pushed but now we see it as the best way to help ourselves
4354052 we think it was either fatah al islam or some unknown forces
4354053 dont stand here any longer because you can be shot from the top of the side road
4354054 this is alawi owned bullet holes in the door this is alawi the same these are sunni shops all burnt out
4354055 they want to sell guns so here everyone needs a gun because everyone is frightened so the place has filled up with guns the army does nothing why not dont they know the names of the gangs dont they know who is behind this
4354056 the heavy heroin and crack using population is stable and appears to be ageing we havent seen an influx of young people at the bottom end
4354057 there has been a shift in the cannabis market with home grown pushing out the imported stuff but because it is stronger people are smoking less of it
4354058 in order to maintain its position on prohibition the government has to show that all drug use is dangerous
4354059 we need legal control and regulation of drug use that is how we manage use of alcohol and we need the same for drugs
4354060 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4354061 the olympics was one of the goals of the season for me so obviously the quarter finals is not going to do it
4354062 i think james played well i can only really say how well he played ive played him on many occasions but this was the best ive seen him im happy for him i hope he can go all the way now
4354063 im not happy with this tournament i wish i could have done much more
4354064 but ive still got to look forward to the us open i still have that and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now and try and save my season
4354065 its like tiger woods when they dont win every single week its called a bad year
4354066 rogers been in two finals of a slam and the semi finals of a slam to consider that a bad year is just amazing
4354067 it shows the labor movement is willing to stand up for the members stand up for the retirees and take some risks
4354068 overall what these negotiations sought to forge is a social contract for the 21st century a more competitive general motors translating into middle class jobs
4354069 in the context of the pressure of globalization and the stumbling of the domestic industry thats not a small feat that proves a relevance for unions under these circumstances rather than a hint of their demise
4354070 workers who were laid off full pay for years at a time
4354071 a direct quote or a report from your union leadership
4354072 hunt oil iraqi kurds defend deal despite u s concern
4354073 to say that it was not a good idea to cut oil deals with the kurdish regional government
4354074 when he took over the reality hit him that he had to deal with afghanistan the horn of africa and a whole bunch of other stuff besides iraq
4354075 hes come to the conclusion that what petraeus is doing is actually more effective than what he thought
4354076 the most important thing is im very happy with what dave has recommended
4354077 he asked why another aircraft carrier was needed in the gulf and insisted there was no military requirement for it
4354078 there are several of us trying to put the crazies back in the box
4354079 in the less than six months ive been in this job i have seen a substantial change and it gives me some significant optimism that this place may just work out the way we had envisioned or some had envisioned when the tasks were undertaken
4354080 whats going on now in the security business in iraq is that things are substantially improved
4354081 by almost any measure any statistical analysis of whats happened in the last few months theres been an improvement
4354082 he also told me that he had severe misgivings about the maliki government and the reasons for that
4354083 he felt in his words that there was a significant linkage to iran he was concerned about iranian influence on the maliki government and he also made several references to his unhappiness uneasiness with maliki and the background from which he came
4354084 this place may just work out the way we had envisioned or some had envisioned when the tasks were undertaken
4354085 yet they stare now across the plane at 10 000 spartans commanding 30 000 free greeks
4354086 contrary to what our president said containment did work leading up to this we contained saddam for over a decade his military atrophied he had no wmd and we were doing it on the cheap
4354087 its ridiculous our objective should have been reasonable representative government
4354088 theres been a definite change in tone from washington and the momentum and drive to support allawi will increase
4354089 its not only that maliki must go but that the whole system must go
4354090 even when bush tried to modify what he said he did not go so far
4354091 we know that bush from inside would like to replace maliki but he did not say it clearly
4354092 the americans finally will support us because they dont have another solution
4354093 if all these things dont work out it is the people who will make a coup they will rise up and there will be a coup all over iraq
4354094 one of the most important blunders ever committed by an administration abroad from the standpoint of u s imperial interests
4354095 too energetic a friendship turkey and iran an attempt to bypass russia annoys the united states
4354096 if you ask our opinion do we think its the right moment to be making investments in the iranian oil and gas sector no we dont
4354097 the paradox for america is that iran is the only country other than iraq that can truly undermine russias energy supremacy
4354098 after years of continuing influence t here is no obvious substitute for baath
4354099 what i like best was cheering everyone on everyone cheering me on and having a good time
4354100 my goal is to get into the top 60 and get my mom to compete
4354101 diplomatic sources in moscow said that the iranian government played a mediatory role in the visit of iraqi oil minister husayn al shahrastani to moscow sources close to the iranian embassy in the russian capital added that iran asked al shahrastani to agree on russias demands to re negotiate the investment of some southern oil wells based on a memorandum of understanding signed by the former iraqi regime with a number of big russian oil firms in the early 1990s the sources went to say the iranian step seeks to secure moscows support for its nuclear programme
4354102 admitting iran would further strain already tense chinese us relations and would not advance chinas main priority in the sco which is to manage relations with its western neighbours
4354103 yang proposalnya tidak lolos seleksi jangan berkecil hati tahun depan masih ada kesempatan dan yang paling penting mengetahui aspek mana yang harus diperbaiki dalam proposalnya
4354104 lppm sangat mendukung kegiatan mahasiswa kkp kkn dan himpro yang berorientasi pada pemberdayaan masyarakat lppm akan berusaha membantu program program pemberdayaan pengabdian sepanjang sinergi dengan program lppm
4354105 also i want the audience to give our pair the respect and dignity it deserves
4354106 it is a period film about men and honour it also has comedy
4354107 almost all the malayalees in the 1960s are familiar with isbens work and can identify with the film very few of the new generation might have heard about the norwegian playwright as an actor i feel it is a blessing for me i feel honoured and lucky to be a part of this film
4354108 for a half century americas primary goal in the middle east was stability on 9 11 we realized that years of pursuing stability to promote peace left us with neither
4354109 goes even further demanding a direct confrontation with the saudis and even recalls the old idea of grabbing the oil rich shiite populated eastern province of saudi arabia
4354110 neither america nor israel appears prepared to lead a fight against iran
4354111 the two countries did agree to form a security committee with iraq to focus on containing sunni insurgents the committee would concentrate on the threat from groups such as in iraq officials said but not those shiite militia groups the us accuses iran of funding and training
4354112 many people see some similarities between maliki and the late saddam except hes much weaker than saddam hussein
4354113 people feel hes in power because hes backed by american tanks others say the dawa party is not popular enough to win elections on their own
4354114 they have their own plan thats what frightens us people want to wreck the whole thing
4354115 hes been looking for a way out for a year
4354116 they are all categorically wrong and there not one thing in those articles that is correct
4354117 representatives from nations that support a two state solution reject violence recognize israels right to exist and commit to all previous agreements between the parties
4354118 every deal goes to the sheik he then trickles the money down to reward sub tribes who cooperate and punish those who dont
4354119 if the americans give us orders and money we will get rid
4354120 we will have a new government run by sunnis that will be fair to all
4354121 finally we decided to cooperate with american forces and kick al qaeda out and have our own country
4354122 in the future we want to have someone in the government
4354123 this is much less about al qaeda overstepping than about them sunnis realizing that theyve lost
4354124 this is all about the sunnis rightful place to rule
4354125 some of the insurgent leaders may have a political agenda and want to run for office at some point
4354126 worried that the sunni tribes may be using mechanisms to build their strength and power eventually to challenge this government this is a risk for all of us
4354127 we dont want to be like the people who sit in the green zone and take orders from bush
4354128 they wanted political cover from our front but we said no
4354129 we dont mind that they fight al qaeda but any movement should be official and not tribal
4354130 to get the palestinian factions to come together in a unity government
4354131 so the first thing i looked for was commitment against the extremists
4354132 the second thing is does he al maliki understand with some extremist groups theres connections with iran and he does and im confident
4354133 now is he trying to get iran to play a more constructive role i presume he is but that doesnt what my question is well my message to him is is that when we catch you playing a non constructive role there will be a price to pay
4354134 said to favour an alternative shia leader as prime minister
4354135 in which i suggested that the details of the draft hydrocarbons law tended to leave russian backed companies especially lukoil out in the cold
4354136 lukoil has done much in iraq has experience of working in our country possesses vast data about iraqi oil deposits these temporary advantages raise the companys chances for winning free and transparent oil tenders
4354137 for the discovered fields where there are no risks involved we do not see any necessity for foreign companies to take control we think the iraqi national oil company can do it with the cooperation with other oil firms
4354138 all the discovered and producing fields will be assigned to the national oil company this includes west qurna
4354139 it is up to the iraqi national oil company to decide how it can develop that field
4354140 assigning oil fields to the national oil company means that the company will have the right to choose foreign companies under contract terms
4354141 most of the oil wells are in southern iraq and the oil law allows krg to talk with companies and make deals for oil production
4354142 there needs to be some criteria according to which the oil contracts are investigated so as to know if there is any corruption in the deals or to what extent the company will implement its obligations
4354143 the council sees that the powers of signing oil and gas contracts with international companies should be confined to the federal government because regions and governorates havent enough experience to do so
4354144 some of the proposed amendments made to the draft oil and gas law by the state shura advisory council are substantial and we think they reduce powers assigned to the kurdistan regional government by the iraqi federal constitution
4354145 we are concerned that the agreed drafts have been bogged down in an obscure committee in baghdad called the shura advisory council which has made unauthorized material changes to the agreed drafts apparently in consultation with unnamed oil ministry officials in baghdad
4354146 this is not acceptable it is a delaying tactic that must be swept aside the agreed drafts must be reinstated and put to the parliament
4354147 the most serious problem with the law is the production sharing agreements which we categorically reject
4354148 exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations
4354149 restoring the balance u s strategy and the gulf crisis an initial report of the washington institutes strategic study group
4354150 the evolution of israeli grand strategy strategy and tactics and the confluence with classic democratic philosophy
4354151 ideas and foreign policy the case of the israeli likud party
4354152 we fully understand that maybe a few months ago they were attacking us we dont trust them but well work with them thats my way of not having to come back for a third rotation getting them to stand up for themselves
4354153 the problem is that the americans have a relationship with the slaves dawa badr organization the mahdi army are slaves to iran
4354154 i dont think theres any debate in the senate about disappointment with the iraqi government its pretty uniform
4354155 i could stand among 1 800 sunnis in abu ghraib
4354156 and feel more comfortable than standing in a formation of shiite iraqi soldiers
4354157 rewarding those people who have been responsible for torturing and killing
4354158 lets have a sunni dominated iraq that will be a check against iran
4354159 an excellent idea i wonder why no one thought of it before
4354160 the real danger isnt irans bomb however but the regime that would wield it here right zionists are quite committed to the shiite government in iraq they see in iraqi shiites a more or less adequate
4354161 i announce my resignation and distance myself from delivering this draft before this parliament and i will carry out my obligation to repeal it inside parliament with all fellow nationalists
4354162 i call on my lawmaker brothers and sisters to confront this law which will ruin the countrys future and will be in the interest of large global companies at the expense of iraqis
4354163 it lifts your heart to hear these children playing and having so much fun after such a sad start in life their mother is a miracle worker
4354164 the most likely alternative is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behaviour which would place new selection pressures on populations and favour adaptive divergence

4354166 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4354167 a basic requirement for sustained growth is availability of energy particularly electricity all over the world there is growing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change
4354168 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4354169 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4354170 the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan
4354171 we will examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and security forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this challenge
4354172 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided
4354173 this requires a politics of consensus not confrontation this requires dialogue among communities not discord
4354174 im not worried about state owned companies like some people are
4354175 many of the major corporations in south korea that already have investments in australia are state owned
4354176 over many years weve had many countries invest in australia that are essentially state owned
4354177 but also theres a number of other factors relating to the mining the strength of the company which is the worlds largest and clearly a very solid foundation
4354178 we have the federal government in south australia saying oh we made short term decisions without long term knowledge in terms of water resources and now were going to have to rectify that
4354179 i struggled for rhythm and the format did not allow me get into the groove in practice we shoot six arrows one by one but here i had to shoot one leave the lane for the opponent to fire one before i could go and have my second go at it

4354183 we have nearly tripled our business in india from 300 million three years ago to 800 million we expect to do this year we will be a billion dollar business next year
4354184 in times of slowdown people look for ways to become more productive the pc volume growth has been healthy in the last quarter
4354185 they are trusting people who have previously attacked american forces and innocent people
4354186 every three months they have a new strategy this is not only a distracting way to conduct policy it is creating insecurity for all i dont think these strategies have been thought through deeply it is all about convenience
4354187 in reality they are forcing the iraqi government and the shia and the kurds to reconcile with the saddamists
4354188 one cannot exclude such a possibility that this is the end of the two state solution
4354189 hamas men are trained equipped and more resolved than their fatah counterparts even if the latter outnumber them in weapons
4354190 the idea is to change the balance which has been in favor of hamas and against fatah with these well trained forces it will help right that imbalance
4354191 the few remaining hawks inside the administration especially those in vice president dick cheneys office
4354192 pressing for greater consideration of military strikes against iranian nuclear facilities
4354193 regime change or the use of force are the only available options to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapons capability if they want it
4354194 u s policy makers have long presumed that the majority shiite population of iraq would serve as irans fifth column there but would it
4354195 iraqi shiites if liberated from saddams tyranny can be expected to present a challenge to irans influence and revolution
4354196 shiite islam is plagued by fissures none of which has been carefully examined let alone exploited by the opponents of irans islamic republic
4354197 a concept promoted by ayatollah khomeini the wilayat al faqih the rule of the jurisprudent
4354198 the bulldozer with which khomeini razed the barrier between the clerics and the politicians
4354199 the concept of wilayat al faqih is rejected by most shiite clerics outside iran and probably many of those within iran too the current leading ayatollah of iraq ayatollah sayyid ali sistani has reaffirmed this rejection much to the chagrin of the iranian government
4354200 liberating the shiite centers in najaf and karbala with their clerics who reject the wilayat al faqih could allow iraqi shiites to challenge and perhaps fatally derail the iranian revolution for the first time in half a century iraq has the chance to replace iran as the center of shiite thought thus resuming its historic place with its tradition of clerical quiescence and of challenge to sunni absolutism a free iraqi shiite community would be a nightmare for the theocratic islamic republic of iran

4354245 somebody that tall should not have that kind of turnover

4354247 this year we were just planning for the 200 meters in beijing
4354248 i know everyone there expects me to set a world record
4354249 with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
4354250 in order to win i have to run 9 6 most likely thats what i trained my mind to do

4354294 neurological disorders are a critical area of need in terms of expanding our ability to design and conduct trials that have maximum efficiency at the lowest possible cost

4354297 it also reduces the environmental impact of the process and we have developed a method that is easy to apply and could bring great benefits to patients in hospitals as well as the food industry
4354298 this is an outstanding example of how chemical engineers are making a crucial contribution to society
4354299 i have been intrigued for years by the question of how a cell knows what to do
4354300 it is exposed to a plethora of signals and many stimuli and somehow it moves forward in the right direction most of the time if it doesnt know what to do the cell may continue to divide and become a cancer
4354301 nature doesnt like chaos so there had to be something logical some process that tells the cell what to become a pathway that integrates a variety of stimuli and comes up with a conclusion
4354302 infs does that it tells the cell dont start anything until i tell you it also is called a safety mechanism its a bean counter it counts the signals and averages them until there is enough to open the gate
4354303 we were the first to have the guts to talk about it publicly it took courage and sticking to an important scientific principal to report on nature as it is rather than what was thought to be the situation when our theory challenged the established scientific opinion this unconventional anti doctrinaire approach has allowed us to explore areas and ideas that were overlooked by many scientists
4354304 integrative nuclear signaling in cell development a role for fgf receptor 1 appeared in the november 2007 issue of dna and cell biology
4354305 the infs pathway offers a novel target for in vivo neural stem cell therapies and anticancer strategies
4354306 it is a universal mechanism that can apply to many areas of biology we have a key now we can move on to develop therapies
4354307 i took my apple out and started eating while i was working as well and she teacher said put that in the bin and you get a sanction and everybodys like but hes diabetic oh hes diabetic and then she was like oh sorry
4354308 he the teacher should have understood a bit more that i was low and didnt know what i was doing because i was talking complete nonsense which is a big sign of being low well my friends know how to react but other people in the class will know when im low and will tell somebody
4354309 i said by the time i get there shell be unconscious
4354310 previous studies have examined the role of parents in diabetes self care and found that parental influence decreases during adolescence as friendships and school life become more important during adolescence examining the influence of school personnel and peers was pertinent there were few studies examining this area so possible outcomes were unknown
4354311 the impact of teachers on young people with diabetes cannot be overestimated given that poorer self care increases the risk of complications including unconsciousness seizures and coma as well as serious long term problems such as blindness and kidney failure
4354312 diabetes is a legally recognised disability all young people with the condition have the right to appropriate school care to help them fully take part in school life young people with diabetes must be allowed to undertake care at any time at school schools need to make all staff aware of pupils with diabetes and their related care needs and staff must be trained in recognising and treating hypoglycaemia
4354313 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4354314 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease

4354387 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4354388 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4354389 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities

4354421 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4354422 daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4354423 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4354424 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4354425 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust
4354426 i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4354427 i looked into putins eyes and got a sense of his soul
4354428 i visited the shrine as i hope those who gave their lives in past wars will rest in peace
4354429 it would be strange if the ideas of the prime minister and mine were always the same
4354430 i will not visit yasukuni while i serve as foreign minister
4354431 i have heard that some ministers are visiting yasukuni in their private capacity and it depends on the insight of each minister
4354432 for us its sad i hope he does what he has to do mr koizumi was upstanding
4354433 it is the way to pay tribute to the war dead for us to face the past humbly and hand down the historical facts to the future without making the lessons from the miserable war fade away
4354434 establishing a nonreligious memorial at which all people could commemorate the war dead together
4354435 i pledge in front of the souls of the war dead to realize a war free and nuclear weapon free world based on the principle of the war renouncing japanese constitution which is managed through international concord not through retaliation and threat and which respects liberty and human rights
4354436 we need to find out what the japanese people think about it i do not think the time to take some actions on the issue has come

4354449 obviously theyre saying i stole a car but i was in a car i guess is stolen but im on a probation violation
4354450 as one of the officers was responding to the manoa shopping center the vehicle in question passed him heading in the opposite direction
4354451 an officer aw one suspect standing near the vehicle who immediately ran upon sight of the officer
4354452 he ended up running through backyards in between housing and jumping over fences
4354453 in this particular case by responding quickly and we happen to be in the right place at the right time to be able to stop these people
4354454 they probably prevented further crimes such as unauthorized entry into motor vehicles you know breaking into cars
4354455 i jumped off of the couch i was super excited about i didnt know what they had found yet or the condition it was in but i was just really excited to know that my car might be found
4354456 the stereo is ripped out and stuff it just feels something has been taken from you
4354457 it was awesome i mean i heard that some of these guys over here were running on foot to catch the guys so it was pretty cool to know that they were out there like helping me out
4354458 it was airborne cause i think it was just coming down so fast and it hit the side of the house scraped the whole side of the house and landed on the concrete and theres a big gaping hole on the concrete
4354459 if it had been like two feet to the right it would have crashed through the family room our living room and it would have broke through the house
4354460 in light of that im sure theyre not gonna stay here tonight i think itll probably be best if they came and stayed with me or my family in town somewhere
4354461 i kinda warned them beforehand that things can happen so please take in consideration you would need extra money on the side to take care of these repairs but whos gonna believe me right
4354462 im ballparking it i would say close to a hundred thousand everything
4354463 i mean we were just waiting to get snorkel equipment down in hanauma bay and he was right behind us
4354464 yeah yeah sort of he asked where we lived and what did you say california yeah we said california and he was like thats cool
4354465 they all went into the water and the security service was around them they all went in the water lifeguards and they all went snorkelling
4354466 and the adults stayed with the kids and within the confines of the surfboards there were lifeguards in the water lifeguards on the surfboards and secret service agents on the surfboards
4354467 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4354468 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4354469 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4354470 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4354471 maybe the stories of the financial crisis flying around are not as substantiated as they should be
4354472 i felt this was the most difficult draw out of the teams we could have met and so it proved
4354473 we did not help ourselves certainly in the first half when they scored the winning goal from that point of view it was very difficult
4354474 we needed a spark to help us unlock the door but we did not have that
4354475 however the second leg comes round we will have more games under our belt hopefully we will make a better fist of it than we did tonight
4354476 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4354477 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4354478 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4354479 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4354480 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4354481 dear dad i have very good news and it is we are coming home soon it might be a week or 2 so we will be back
4354482 we might see you again and we might not if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake
4354483 but that does not matter what matters to me is getting out of here and going home to you see you have a doghter sic and son who love you very very much
4354484 dear dad this is dylan we are still alive we are ok and we know what happened to mom mark and slade and im sorry you had to loose sic a son and an exwife and im sorry we had to be taken away from you and i miss you

4354487 hes killed way a lot more people that you dont even know about he killed dylan if you look in the back of it the jeep duncan was driving theres a gun in there
4354488 up to the point of what occurred at the campground
4354489 i am an over the road truck driver and spend 11 hours behind the wheel every day as a result my calves and ankles would swell up and ache badly and my circulation was poor enough that a small injury to my shin turned in to venous ulcer that refused to fully heal for almost 18 months
4354490 its the first time ive ever been at a swimming event and i said this cant be normal
4354491 i dont know that well ever see it in our lifetime
4354492 i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4354493 i think you have to be realistic as to how incredible this effort is
4354494 it has to do with his physical ability his ability to race his ability to keep his focus to get excited when he needs to get excited to get down when he needs to get down
4354495 to maintain a high level of performance over two or three olympic games is very very difficult
4354496 if michael sticks around for 2012 its going to set the bar incredibly high
4354497 i dont want to say he does it effortlessly but he does it beautifully
4354498 im not sure ill see another one as good as he in my lifetime
4354499 the impetus to specialize is definitely going to be there
4354500 because if you spread yourself too thin youre probably going to sacrifice your best event
4354501 hes showing a different kind of courage than i did
4354502 i was not chasing mark spitzs record i was chasing swimmer don schollander and jesse owens who each won four golds at a single olympics when i came up with a program of seven it seemed to be almost ridiculously invented by myself
4354503 it definitely never ever gets old listening to the national anthem play
4354504 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4354505 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan

4354521 as venues offering thoroughly gendered entertainment similar in nature to sex cinemas or peep shows lap dancing clubs need to be recognised regulated and licensed for what they are part of the commercial sex industry not the ordinary leisure industry
4354522 tinkering with legislation primarily designed to regulate cafes and karaoke bars is not the vehicle for this neither is relying on planning controls
4354523 instead the only viable solution is to allow local authorities to licence lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments venues that provide visual sexual entertainment
4354524 in cases where death occurs there will always be an expectation that a severe sentence will result
4354525 however where there is a low level of fault and significant mitigating factors a community sentence may be more appropriate of course where the facts of the case indicate a custodial sentence is appropriate the courts will act accordingly
4354526 we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4354527 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4354528 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls
4354529 these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4354530 these figures show that age discrimination within the nhs is still rife
4354531 the system is therefore clearly failing thousands of older people
4354532 it is unacceptable for them to be treated any differently our recent darzi review sets out a framework for improving the quality of care for everybody that uses the nhs
4354533 a lot of progress has been made already with the treatment and care of older people but we recognise more can be done

4354543 the results of this survey show that its not as simple as saying well someone in this community likes it so everyone does this survey shows that what works in one community doesnt necessarily work in another
4354544 do you venerable brethren in your outstanding wisdom and prudence judge that the bodily assumption of the blessed virgin can be proposed and defined as a dogma of faith do you with your clergy and people desire it
4354545 the holy spirit has placed as bishops to rule the church of god
4354546 the holy spirit was not promised to the successors of peter in such a way that by his revelation they might manifest new doctrine but so that by his assistance they might guard as sacred and might faithfully propose the revelation delivered through the apostles or the deposit of faith
4354547 all those things are to be believed by divine and catholic faith which are contained in the written word of god or in tradition and which are proposed by the church either in solemn judgment or in its ordinary and universal teaching office as divinely revealed truths which must be believed
4354548 because it is the profession subject to the supreme teaching authority within the church of heavenly truths can supply proofs and testimonies of no small value for deciding a particular point of christian doctrine
4354549 venerable to us o lord is the festivity of this day on which the holy mother of god suffered temporal death but still could not be kept down by the bonds of death who has begotten your son our lord incarnate from herself
4354550 an ineffable mystery all the more worthy of praise as the virgins assumption is something unique among men
4354551 god the king of the universe has granted you favors that surpass nature
4354552 the holy roman church has observed for a long time and still observes
4354553 it was fitting that she who had kept her virginity intact in childbirth should keep her own body free from all corruption even after death
4354554 you are she who as it is written appears in beauty and your virginal body is all holy all chaste entirely the dwelling place of god so that it is henceforth completely exempt from dissolution into dust
4354555 as the most glorious mother of christ our savior and god and the giver of life and immortality has been endowed with life by him she has received an eternal incorruptibility of the body together with him who has raised her up from the tomb and has taken her up to himself in a way known only to him
4354556 arise o lord into your resting place you and the ark which you have sanctified
4354557 that goes up by the desert as a pillar of smoke of aromatical spices of myrrh and frankincense
4354558 hail full of grace the lord is with you blessed are you among women
4354559 for she was full of grace and blessed among women
4354560 you have here a clear statement that the blessed virgin has been assumed in her body where was the place of the lords feet
4354561 has risen up since on this day the virgin mother has been taken up to her heavenly dwelling
4354562 from these proofs and authorities and from many others it is manifest that the most blessed mother of god has been assumed above the choirs of angels
4354563 who is this that comes up from the desert flowing with delights leaning upon her beloved
4354564 from this we can see that she is there bodily
4354565 and who i ask could believe that the ark of holiness the dwelling place of the word of god the temple of the holy spirit could be reduced to ruin
4354566 what son would not bring his mother back to life and would not bring her into paradise after her death if he could
4354567 jesus did not wish to have the body of mary corrupted after death since it would have redounded to his own dishonor to have her virginal flesh from which he himself had assumed flesh reduced to dust
4354568 this teaching has already been accepted for some centuries it has been held as certain in the minds of the pious people and it has been taught to the entire church in such a way that those who deny that marys body has been assumed into heaven are not to be listened to patiently but are everywhere to be denounced as over contentious or rash men and as imbued with a spirit that is heretical rather than catholic
4354569 keeping in mind the standards of propriety and when there is no contradiction or repugnance on the part of scripture the mysteries of grace which god has wrought in the virgin must be measured not by the ordinary laws but by the divine omnipotence
4354570 when this mortal thing hath put on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
4354571 the necs decision was groundless it said we have no evidence but we have provided much evidence including witnesses and false 1018 electoral forms to the nec
4354572 normally as soon as we complain the nec is ready to reject it
4354573 on the electoral day we saw so many irregularities happen anything prohibited occurred on election day the use of alcoholic substances the presence of village and commune chiefs around ballot stations and deletion of many voters names
4354574 the complaints are unclear and there is no evidence such a demand is not easy to address
4354575 you said to buy gold at the time i thought it was a little flakey buying gold that is but then the price went up and i thought of you
4354576 but financial analysis at least on this kind of macro level is mostly fraud
4354577 you know things in the financial markets have been going very well for a very long time
4354578 but investors talk as though it were the end of the world its not its only the beginning of a major correction and probably only the beginning of the beginning

4354581 in merced calif 63 of homes sold during the past 12 months brought in less than what the owner paid prices there have fallen 40 over the past 12 months and 56 from their 2006 peak
4354582 about 63 of sellers in stockton calif lost money during the same period 60 in modesto calif 55 in las vegas and 38 in phoenix
4354583 and the trend has worsened in recent months in merced 74 9 of sellers took a loss when they sold during the three months ended june 30 compared with just 28 7 during the same period in 2007

4354588 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4354589 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4354590 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4354605 teach an old indicator new tricks or the commodity channel index not for commodities only
4354606 from your comment about economic conditions and the outlook you obviously believe stock prices are high why dont you sell stocks with the idea of repurchasing at lower prices the businessman also should be aware of a problem confronting open end investment company managements

4354613 paul came back from iraq and i immediately felt as though he was a total stranger
4354614 its been two years and im still learning about him
4354615 he couldnt hold a job and he had anger issues that were not there before he was also very self conscious and not trusting of people
4354616 it wasnt until we reached out for help that things started to turn around
4354617 i know there are a lot of families out there going through the same issues as we are
4354618 thats where we found out about the save program which helped us out a lot
4354619 the program was able to find me information that i never knew was out there for military families going through financial and emotional hardships
4354620 he was put in the middle of hell in iraq
4354621 weve gotten so much support from the lions club and our church
4354622 things are getting better because of all the support weve gotten
4354623 we want to make sure other families get that same support
4354624 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe

4354632 maybe the american congress has made such a commitment but we have not
4354633 the vice president is not necessarily responsible for every single thing that comes out of the mouth of every single member of his staff
4354634 chatter about iran one finds something less than a full throated endorsement of military intervention
4354635 there are tribal sheiks out there who say hey just allow me to be the local security force i dont care what you call me you can call me whatever you want just give me the right training and equipment and ill secure my area and thats the direction were moving out there
4354636 they say we hate you because you are an occupier but we hate al qaeda worse and we hate the persians iranians even worse you cant ignore that whole population
4354637 the governments aim is to disarm and demobilize the militias in iraq
4354638 and we have enough militias in iraq that we are struggling now to solve the problem why are we creating new ones
4354639 when youve got people who say i want to protect my neighbors we ought to jump like a duck on a june bug
4354640 as i deal with the government at a provincial level i have a concern about whether or not that government is truly a representative government that respects the human rights of all the iraqis in that province
4354641 that has to happen well facilitate an election but the government of iraq has to schedule those elections
4354642 you do have leaders in very high positions who are making sectarian based decisions no doubt about it i see indications of sectarian decisions and not iraqi decisions
4354643 we seem to be sanction happy as a government the problem is that the good lord didnt see fit to always put oil and gas resources where there are democratic governments
4354644 its been conclusively proven iran is not going to be talked out of its nuclear programme so to stop them from doing it we have to massively increase the pressure
4354645 if we cant get enough other countries to come along with us to do that then weve got to go with regime change by bolstering opposition groups and the like because thats the circumstance most likely for an iranian government to decide that its safer not to pursue nuclear weapons than to continue to do so and if all else fails if the choice is between a nuclear capable iran and the use of force then i think we need to look at the use of force
4354646 an iranian government to decide that its safer not to pursue nuclear weapons
4354647 give them an ultimatum he did not specify what the ultimatum was
4354648 the talks will only be about the responsibilities of the occupiers in iraq he said during a speech to a group of clerics in mashhad city about 620 miles northeast of tehran according to state run television
4354649 maliki is the chosen vehicle hes the one trick pony
4354650 everyone recognizes that the success or failure of u s policy would be delivered through the office of the prime minister
4354651 during the arrest operation the targeted individual was killed after he resisted arrest
4354652 known key criminal leader who was believed to have been involved in criminal activity such as weapons trafficking theft and assassinations
4354653 he was also suspected of intimidation against local security forces and local civilians in basra and planning and participating in attacks against mnf multinational forces
4354654 prominent member of the militant arm of jaish al mahdi in the basra area
4354655 the citizens of basra are far safer now that the criminal leader is off the streets
4354656 he was a very good person serious and was working very hard to stabilise basra
4354657 he used to restrain his men from going into clashes against other militias he was a nationalist who had no connections to iran there will be repercussions as his men will accuse fadhila a rival shia faction and they will try to avenge his death
4354658 virtue party to bolster their position ahead of a planned british withdrawal
4354659 irans access to nuclear technology is not the problem of the us or the west irans attaining a geostrategic position is their problem
4354660 the maliki government is part of the problem not part of the solution
4354661 when you weaken irans influence in iraq it will also weaken malikis government
4354662 the maliki government is using iranian intelligence to get rid of its opponents
4354663 the u s iranian alliance is the number one enemy of iraq and of the arab nation
4354664 the costs of staying are visible the costs of getting out are almost never discussed if we get out before iraq is stable the entire middle east region might start to resemble iraq today getting out is not a solution
4354665 when we are in iraq we are in many ways containing the violence if we back off we give it more room to breathe and it may metastasize in some way and become a regional problem we dont have to be there at the same force level but it is a five to seven year process to get any reasonable stability in iraq
4354666 my message will be vladimir i call him vladimir that you shouldnt fear a missile defense system
4354667 i will continue to work with president putin vladimir putin to explain to him that this the missile shield is not aimed at him
4354668 ill work to see to it that its not tense
4354669 us policy has fostered the belief that the american cold war was never really aimed at soviet communism but always at russia
4354670 we were very worried at the time parc was first announced mostly because the thought of a prison in a quiet village like ours was quite frightening
4354671 we were worried about what might happen when the prisoners were released or when their families came to visit
4354672 but it hasnt worried us at all we have built up great contacts with the prison and theyve helped us financially with items for the village including paying for new gates for coity castle
4354673 we have even had some lovely hanging baskets made by the prisoners
4354674 so i would tell people in cwmbran and elsewhere not to worry
4354675 there is a need for a prison in north wales because all our prisoners have to go to england and we believe its vital to have a local prison to help reduce reoffending by working with prisoners in their own communities
4354676 it is also important to look at female prisoners and young offenders both of whom have to travel outside north wales and in the case of young offenders that can mean being housed more than 200 miles from their families
4354677 with all the prison places in england it is very difficult for first language welsh speakers to get any education or training in their own language
4354678 my wife and i live together but we just really exist with each other
4354679 do you not think i get it i know shes 16 it sucks the one person who gets me the most and i care about is 16 im not crossing that line
4354680 how come guys dont like me theyre nice to me but they dont want to date me
4354681 yeah just say what were both thinking youre going to tell me it was a mistake

4354684 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4354685 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4354686 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4354687 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4354688 the problem is that bandar has been pursuing a policy that was music to the ears of the bush administration but was not what king abdullah had in mind at all
4354689 all of us have been arguing in both parties that youre going to have to leave forces behind in iraq
4354690 hey look you lift the sanctions going to be on our own here dont lift the sanctions get the inspectors back in
4354691 well wait a minute maybe hes not so bad maybe we should lift the no fly zone maybe we should lift the sanctions
4354692 but theres a second french attitude that i think we have to come to grips with and understand and that is the desire on the part of france to build the european union as a counterweight to the united states
4354693 well i dont think we have the luxury of changing priorities from one day to the next
4354694 most closely identified with william kristol and john mccain for whom iraq is and has always been about us boots on the ground and the
4354695 hizbullah defeated israel in the war this is the first war israel lost
4354696 yes there is no doubt its not something one can argue about it there is a lot of anger at israel
4354697 i know this will annoy many of your readers but the anger is over the fact that israel did not fight against the syrians instead of israel fighting against hizbullah many parts of the american administration believe that israel should have fought against the real enemy which is syria and not hizbullah
4354698 they hoped israel would do it you cannot come to another country and order it to launch a war but there was hope and more than hope that israel would do the right thing it would have served both the american and israeli interests
4354699 the neocons are responsible for the fact that israel got a lot of time and space they believed that israel should be allowed to win a great part of it was the thought that israel should fight against the real enemy the one backing hizbullah it was obvious that it is impossible to fight directly against iran but the thought was that its strategic and important ally should be hit
4354700 it is difficult for iran to export its shiite revolution without joining syria which is the last nationalistic arab country
4354701 the final outcome is that israel did not do it
4354702 no one would have stopped you it was an american interest they would have applauded you

4354710 he also told me that he had severe misgivings about the maliki government and the reasons for that
4354711 he felt in his words that there was a significant linkage to iran he was concerned about iranian influence on the maliki government and he also made several references to his unhappiness uneasiness with maliki and the background from which he came
4354712 throughout the region our country has interests to protect and commitments to honor
4354713 with two carrier strike groups in the gulf were sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike well keep the sea lanes open well stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats well disrupt attacks on our own forces well continue bringing relief to those who suffer and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom
4354714 bringing relief to those who suffer and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom
4354715 she has been one of the main elements of mossad in driving a velvet revolution strategy in iran the paper wrote
4354716 it is a false and hollow accusation that haleh esfandiari is one of the principle instruments of israel or a mossad spy service in advancing the strategy of a velvet revolution in iran it is a lie that haleh esfandiari had undercover assignments or that she was one of the media spies in iran she had no part in setting up a communications network between dubai and america
4354717 she is an effective member of the pre revolution zionist lobby in the pahlavi court who along with her husband founded the zionist ayandegan newspaper in tehran the interesting point is that haleh esfandiari remained in iran for a time after the revolution but with the ban on ayandegan newspaper she fled iran in august of 1979 for israel
4354718 it is said that she was the architect of aipacs conference two years ago which met under the slogan of now is the time to stop iran suggesting a review of all avenues to confront irans nuclear programs this conferences motto iran the point of understanding between us and israel tried to review ways for coordinating israel and us efforts to apply pressure on islamic republic of iran george bush condoleeza rice hillary cinton john bolton ihud ulmert and amir perez were some of the speakers in this conference it is said that the decision of war with lebanons hezbollah was reached in this conference
4354719 revolution from within can the iranian people reclaim the republic
4354720 go swim you son of a bitch you got it
4354721 at the wall usa insert athlete here wins it gold for usa again
4354722 u s hopes for long term military bases in kurdistan
4354723 two we unequivocally favor iraqs territorial integrity which president george w bush reiterated in his recent speech on iraq three the hydrocarbon law was not written by us but by a sovereign state that is iraq
4354724 acceleration in presenting it is inappropriate since the security condition is not encouraging
4354725 under the guise of helping to conduct free and fair elections for the state duma in december 2007 and of the president of the russian federation in march 2008 u s taxpayers money is being used to fund numerous training courses surveys seminars and other events that propagandize and distort the situation
4354726 we would like to see russia a full fledged member of the world trade organization and hope that russia will undertake the commitments and responsibilities the obligations that come with being a wto member
4354727 the question that i get asked when it comes to jackson vanik and permanent normal trade relations with russia is is the wto ready to let russia in and the answer is not yet
4354728 the cold war ended in moscow but not in washington
4354729 interventionary impulse has now grown even into suggestions that putin be overthrown by the kind of us backed color revolutions
4354730 the first principle of policy toward post communist russia must follow the hippocratic injunction do no harm
4354731 if you want to know which one is closer to me the u s or russia which we saw in action in chechnya i will say the u s
4354732 i tell great powers including the u s that they are mistaken because they have not signed the kyoto protocol and that they are wrong in iraq but we have common values such as democracy
4354733 the office of grand ayatollah sistani is deeply concerned about the new law
4354734 would not be the final one and there would be other drafts
4354735 in my opinion our country is now one led by the clerics and the new political process in iraq is made to allow those clerics and religious parties to govern iraq
4354736 what some news agencies said quoting who they described as an aide to sayyed sistani about his position on the de baathification law was not true
4354737 we are surprised by attempts trying to get the shiite clerical establishment involved in a case which is the speciality of constitutional organisations
4354738 what some news agencies said quoting who they described as an aide to sayyed sistani about his position on the de baathification law was not true
4354739 we are surprised by attempts trying to get the shiite clerical establishment involved in a case which is the speciality of constitutional organisations
4354740 these developments will allow the region to look forward to the future with hope and this is reflected in the monument which is being dedicated at the 10th anniversary commemorative ceremony
4354741 students will be inundated with academic and careers advice over the next few days but it is important not to ignore the emotional impact of the problems and big decisions many young people find themselves facing
4354742 we would encourage anyone who is feeling despair to call lifeline our role is to listen and to support never to judge and to help those in need through their troubled time
4354743 our company is entering new regions including politically unstable regions we will especially need support of the ministry in iraq
4354744 new iraqi oil law to open upstream sector gives powers to rejuvenated national company
4354745 i wish id known that before i went on air
4354746 the very fundamental issue is they dont know where the hell theyre going
4354747 so rather than go over there develop an ulcer and eventually leave i said no thanks
4354748 theres the residue of the cheney view were going to win there that justifies anything we did
4354749 and then theres the pragmatist view how the hell do we get out of dodge and survive unfortunately the people with the former view are still in the positions of most influence
4354750 we played our part and we showed our good will
4354751 now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way
4354752 i cant understand why these americans havent done anything to use our unpopularity against us
4354753 dont worry russia is weak yeltsin will swallow hard and accept nato expansion there will be no cost
4354754 the process of nato expansion has nothing to do with modernization of the alliance
4354755 we all know the answer its directed against russia o k fine
4354756 he is suspected of funding rogue jam through large scale employment of militia members
4354757 we havent asked for the immediate withdrawal of multinational forces we asked that we should build our security forces and make them qualified and at that point there would be a withdrawal
4354758 but no one can accept the occupation of his country
4354759 plan b if the current crackdown fails to stem the violence in the capital
4354760 the option of a political solution failed and there is no choice now for the government except to use force against these militias but its too late
4354761 up to now legal procedures have not been observed al hashemi said
4354762 the human rights of iraqis have not been respected as they should be in this regard
4354763 moving at the speed of turtles because the shiite parties are reluctant
4354764 they view the resistance as a terror group that is no different from al qaida and thats the problem we are facing now he said of the shiites
4354765 theyll kill a lot of us and well kill some of them and eventually theyll get tired and go home
4354766 hoist iraqi flags atop homes apartment buildings and government departments to show the sovereignty and independence of iraq and that you reject the presence of american flags and those of other nations occupying our beloved iraq
4354767 we have the biggest reo fan sitting in front of us what else could go wrong
4354768 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4354769 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality
4354770 algae suffering from lead poisoning like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins
4354771 believe they have the united states at some disadvantage because of the situation in iraq
4354772 to be precise i told them both that i thought the iranians were overplaying their hand and that one of the consequences of that is that they have raised real concerns on the part of a number of countries in the region and beyond about their intentions he told reporters
4354773 right at this moment theres really nothing the iranians want from us
4354774 and so in any negotiation right now we would be the supplicant asking iran to stop doing such things as enriching uranium for its nuclear program
4354775 we need some leverage it seems to me before we engage with the iranians gates added
4354776 this demonstrates our resolve to do what we can to bring security and stability to the region cmdr kevin aandahl of the u s navys fifth fleet in bahrain said tuesday
4354777 im not convinced that we have a lot of time given the peril that would result its astonishing to me that we do not now have a serious political strategy with iran
4354778 if we continue on our current course we have only a military option so what im urging and this should have happened a very long time ago is that we make a serious effort to work with the internal iranian opposition
4354779 contest for regional supremacy replaces cold war conflict in afghanistan
4354780 the taliban are not pakistani mercenaries but they are facilitated and trained by pakistan they are permitted to recruit in pakistan they are really a transnational afghan pakistani phenomenon
4354781 there is a big russian and iranian role with anti taliban forces but it is not as extensive as pakistans role with the taliban
4354782 in my view technological legal and environmental risks that are involved in the trans caspian gas pipeline project make it impossible to find an investor for it unless it is viewed as a purely political project and unless it does not matter what this pipe will pump
4354783 it would not be good for europe it concentrates more natural gas to one supplier
4354784 khristenkos american counterpart us energy secretary samuel bodman appears to view the outcome as a significant setback for us efforts to help break european dependence on russia
4354785 before the war i was arguing for a quarter of a million troops in expectations wed be there five or 10 years
4354786 richard perle obviously somebody else whos thought of as a neocon thought we should go in
4354787 we had spent almost 20 years of our life together were raising children together
4354788 voc pode imaginar a id ia que deus faz de voc
4354789 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4354790 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4354791 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4354792 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
4354793 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4354794 without rule of law corruption will get involved and nobody is responsible to anyone
4354795 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
4354796 it represents the most outdated management system that still exists in this country
4354797 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
4354798 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
4354799 the chinese people have intense wishes for a strong chinese team but we need more tolerance and time
4354800 like you we also want to improve to make a change
4354801 the good news is that we have 31 907 students
4354802 the bad news is weve got resources for about 20 000
4354803 i dont think theres anybody whos really sad on this side of cary street
4354804 i definitely think there should be a shift from building size and upping the number of students to focusing on academics
4354805 carver is getting the unfair brunt of all the growth thats going on
4354806 well i hear that twighlight series is really popular oh lets get that
4354807 times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress
4354808 the interest in retaining a tradition that excludes an historically disfavored minority group from a status that is extended to all others even when the tradition is long standing and widely shared does not necessarily represent a compelling state interest
4354809 we hold that when the government attempts to intrude upon the personal and private lives of homosexuals in a manner that implicates the rights identified in lawrence the government must advance an important governmental interest
4354810 an inherent division between the ovp office of the vice president and the white house staff
4354811 not going to protect one staffer and sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others
4354812 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4354813 fewer highway deaths is always the silver lining of a down economy
4354814 us warns against pipeline going through iran but few listen
4354815 i understand that the us has its interests as a superpower but we have our interests and we have to feed our people
4354816 let the americans say dont be friends with iran but we cant do that because we are a neutral country
4354817 in our eyes everyone is equal but iran comes first we have to cooperate with them
4354818 israeli is subtle player in central asia oil ex intelligence agent advances western interests
4354819 he is our ambassador at large he opens doors and understands the rules of the game
4354820 if everything works out we shall have an agreement by mid november
4354821 we count on the new turkmenistan leaders continuing their course and further developing bilateral ties
4354822 i expect there will be a massive fight for power now in turkmenistan and its likely to take place between pro u s and pro russian forces
4354823 gas will become the main coin of exchange and the key asset to get hold of

4354853 hes against engagement with iran and syria and hes very serious about waging policy battles when he disagrees

4354860 these regions started the melt season covered with thin first year ice which is especially vulnerable to melting out completely
4354861 thin ice is also vulnerable to breakup by winds the last 10 days have seen a windy stormy pattern that has accelerated the ice loss

4354867 and thats the type of response youd expect out of an olympian at that point we had a veteran behind the plate saskatoon catcher erin cumpstone and a veteran in the circle that was the ball game
4354868 in the last olympics i had the bases loaded against japan and got out of it and i totally brought myself back to that situation
4354869 our team is amazing i just had to look at our team and i knew if i just made a decent pitch and they put the ball n the ground wed get them out weve been there before our defence is amazing
4354870 i thought it was out and but it was dropping and i thought she was going to catch it
4354871 then she dropped it and i thought oh my god ive got to run after it hit her glove i just put my head down and kept running
4354872 this was probably our biggest game of the round robin
4354873 but its also one of the bigger games because we do have such great games with them and it does go either way

4354899 the odds are that we wont microchip every plant but it will have a deterrent effect
4354900 in some cases the thieves work for landscapers and in other cases they are independent contractors who sell the saguaro to legitimate commercial operations

4354902 al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4354903 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4354904 it could be a bit of a knock on the clean government issue in alaska she backed
4354905 right now in alaska all you have to do is say the word investigation and people are going to be running away
4354906 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4354907 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4354908 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4354909 we have been working on the question of receiving natural gas from alternative sources first of all we shall accomplish talks with azerbaijan and turkey only after that if it is necessary we shall continue our talks with iran
4354910 but the only thing is clear georgia will not be left without gas in winter
4354911 we comprehend that georgia can find itself in a difficult situation and we are interested that the country will not be left without natural gas we know georgia has been conducting talks with the neighboring countries azerbaijan and turkey on the question of receiving additional amount of gas i think this amount of gas will be enough not to import gas from iran
4354912 as baker sees this the conference would provide a unique opportunity for the united states to strike a deal without jewish pressure

4354916 would be devastating to iran which is facing economic difficulties even with todays high oil prices
4354917 this is a very high level problem this is about turki the king and bandar
4354918 lets say the men dont have a lot of professional admiration for each other
4354919 to accept the logic of his own observations about the course of the iraq occupation
4354920 cheney may be somewhat isolated within the administration at times but he remains untouchable
4354921 another example of an activist court and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard the will of the people
4354922 believed a constitutional amendment was necessary because all it takes is one person in a black robe to declare a law invalid
4354923 it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much
4354924 ive spent over 10 years fighting fires and doing my best to save lives as a paramedic for the city
4354925 but i felt like all that meant nothing when i was penalized for being with my partner in his time of need
4354926 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4354927 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless
4354928 i just wanted to get in the top three and advance
4354929 that was my main focus and i did that im satisfied
4354930 our year to date sales growth of 99 percent for the ps3 reaffirms that consumers are indeed embracing ps3 as their entertainment hub of choice with its feature rich offerings like blu ray and our recently announced video delivery service
4354931 with an unmatched software line up that includes littlebigplanet socom confrontation resistance 2 and motorstorm pacific rift and the anticipated launch of our new 80gb ps3 model were confident in a strong second half of the year and look forward to quickly addressing any inventory shortages due to the transition
4354932 our year to date sales growth of 99 for the ps3 reaffirms that consumers are indeed embracing ps3 as their entertainment hub of choice with its feature rich offerings like blu ray and our recently announced video delivery service
4354933 this singing competition is becoming a farce and is grossly unfair to the talented people who are working very hard and deserve to be recognized for their talent
4354934 one might even want to think about going back two weeks and starting from there perhaps the judging should be like dancing with the stars where the judges count as 50 percent of the vote
4354935 discipline sacrifice and desire that anyone can and should aspire too
4354936 ever whistled at a woman in a wheelchair checked out the boobs of a blind babe if the answers no this barrier breaking show will put an end to that
4354937 as soon as the sun came up the insurgents began shooting
4354938 they were able to coordinate mortars at us they were able to execute well aimed shots from the cover of buildings
4354939 there were mortar rounds that went off close to our vehicle it was difficult to concentrate on my job
4354940 a few minutes later we started taking fire again from the building normally that would have pretty much ended the whole engagement they were fighting pretty persistently
4354941 it is about as defensible a terrain as you can get
4354942 there are some extreme elements of the mehdi army and we will go after them i will allow the government to decide whether sadr is part of it or not he is currently working within the political system
4354943 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
4354944 it now comes time for us to be able to present our side of the story
4354945 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena
4354946 is it an explosive situation that can create a backlash sure but thats not what i see
4354947 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too
4354948 my approach has been i admit careful its been step by step ive not been willing to try for the big bang
4354949 to take the time to talk to the parties on the basis of the same questions and the same issues is well worth the time and i wont promise you that i wont have to do that again before we can even move the process even further forward
4354950 prince bandar and the heads of jordanian and egyptian security
4354951 that i have come late to this conclusion but i have all the zeal of a convert as to the ill effect that the iranians are having on the situation in iraq
4354952 the aswan meeting with the mukhabarat chiefs wasnt elaborated on in any of the western accounts but abdulbari atwan writing in al quds al arabi explained that for instance in egypt the foreign minister handles things like economic cooperation with sri lanka while the palestinian file is in the hands of suleiman and the same in saudi arabia where bandar is the person in charge of the lebanon and iran files atwan who is well connected didnt say specifically what was talked about in those rice mukhabarat meetings suggesting he doesnt know did they talk about iraq
4354953 on her penultimate visit to jerusalem six weeks ago rice discovered upon her arrival that olmert had informed the media about his telephone conversation with bush the previous day
4354954 the message was unmistakable what rice had to say barely mattered
4354955 george i think its time we ended our relationship its not me its you
4354956 were not making any direct accusations but let me say that the trends and the record seem to be very clear
4354957 the implication that syria may be involved is of course a very heavy one but the burden of responsibility that syria bears not to interfere in the situation in lebanon could not be more important than at this moment
4354958 we hope there will be something dramatic the challenges obviously in front of both of them are immense
4354959 they dont want the 2008 presidential and congressional campaign to be about staying the course
4354960 thats where the calculus of bush and the republicans diverge very quickly everyone is thinking about the next election and bush doesnt have one
4354961 in the real world the baker report is now the vehicle for those republicans who want to extricate themselves from iraq
4354962 mccain is articulating the strategy for victory in iraq bush will have to choose and the republican party will have to choose in the very near future between baker and mccain
4354963 opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war
4354964 iran is fighting a proxy war in iraq and its a very dangerous course for them to be following they are already committing daily acts of war against us and british forces
4354965 they iran are behind a lot of high profile attacks meant to undermine us will and british will such as the rocket attacks on basra palace and the green zone in baghdad the attacks are directed by the revolutionary guard who are connected right to the top of the iranian government
4354966 bush is allowing vice president cheney and secretary of state rice to play good cop bad cop with the iranians
4354967 draft oil law new iraqi law will reportedly allow large scale investment by western oil majors
4354968 most of the oil wells are in southern iraq and the oil law allows krg to talk with companies and make deals for oil production
4354969 there needs to be some criteria according to which the oil contracts are investigated so as to know if there is any corruption in the deals or to what extent the company will implement its obligations
4354970 a religious fanaticism that says we must believe that the united states would have invaded iraq even if its main product was lettuce and pickles
4354971 if you thought i was an annoying self important sack of unfocussed bile resentful snarls and petulant non sequiturs before i found god you aint seen nothing yet
4354972 the presidents speeches as well as by his unscripted remarks at press conferences and other venues
4354973 whose political purposes as an enemy of israel are even worse than are those of the old foreign policy establishment
4354974 in practice the resolution makes it all but impossible for israel to defend itself against hezbollah aggression without being exposed to international condemnation on an unprecedented scale
4354975 the resolution makes absolutely no mention of either syria or iran without whose support hezbollah could neither exist nor wage an illegal war against israel
4354976 he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it
4354977 car shoppers who panicked in june and july about gas prices are losing intrest in small cars and hybrids as fuel prices have declined
4354978 in june 31 4 of recent new car buyers surveyed said the purchase was motivated by a desire for better gas mileage acxiom says that is up from 21 1 in february but still less than a third of buyers there is not this huge flood to one segmennt in the auto industry
4354979 having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage
4354980 we dont want to hear that word it is against our religion
4354981 no people in the middle east outside of israel and turkey are ever going to be pro us or pro israel and no us administration could have any illusions about that
4354982 contains a damgerous and unwarranted assumption namely that there is some inherent relationship between being
4354983 as a former cia official leverett is required to submit his writings for pre publication review
4354984 use force to change the borders or form of government of the islamic republic of iran
4354985 will be adopted as a result of the ongoing white house iraq policy review
4354986 the objective was to change the face of the middle east but it was impossible to create a mini democracy amidst a sea of dictatorships looking to destroy this poor democracy and thus where do insurgents in iraq come from from iran and syria
4354987 no there was a need for massive political action of threats and pressure on these governments financial pressure for example the sanctions on syria were nothing there was a period of time when the syrians were afraid that they were next it would have been possible to use this momentum in a smarter way theres no need to go in militarily
4354988 the final decisions were no in their hands in the pentagon the decisions were in the hands of the military and the political leadership had a lot of clashes with the military leadership
4354989 powell curbed our ideas and they did not pass there was a lot of frustration over the years in the administration because we didnt feel we were succeeding
4354990 when you enter the administration you have to keep your mouth shut now many will resume their writing now from the outside they will be able to convey all the criticism they kept inside
4354991 we did not bring the us into iraq in such a way our biggest war which we lost was the idea that before entering iraq we must train an exile iraqi government and an iraqi military force and hand over the rule to them immediately after the occupation and leave iraq that was our idea and it was not accepted
4354992 i dont think that bandar is going off on his own
4354993 a new generation of saudi royals in strategic government positions
4354994 published in connection with his time as a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies csis in washington read in full nevertheless the relevant point in the context of saudi relations with iranian and iraqi shiites is that the report is as one might predict
4354995 i dont think anybody anticipated the level of violence that weve encountered
4354996 are feeling optimistic today precisely because they think the us has already started to win dirty handing iraq to iran other critics have suggested that the neocon incompetence bushs shiite gang in iraq
4354997 its not good to encourage anybody to talk on behalf of the iraqi people on their internal and national affairs al hashemi told reporters on the last day of an international conference held by the geneva based world economic forum
4354998 we say stop your interference in our internal affairs stop settling scores on our soil stop being part of covert plans to destabilize iraq and sit down with us to settle our differences resolve outstanding issues and talk about economic cooperation
4354999 the situation in iraq is going to spill over sooner or later
4355000 we are not asking anyone to come and make decisions for us all that we need is to stop people who are capitalising on our human tragedy if this is beyond the capacity of the us then let the united nations and our neighbours take over
4355001 we want foreign oil companies and we have to lure them into iraq to learn from their expertise and acquire their technology but we shouldnt give them big privileges
4355002 we have to end proxy wars we dont want any party to use iraq as a fighting ground for capital gains
4355003 when there is a national feeling of weakness it opens the door for other affiliations to emerge at the expense of our collective security in the region
4355004 there are serious flaws in the regional order and some countries are interfering in the affairs of arab countries
4355005 we need to see deeds on the ground and respect for iraqs territorial integrity
4355006 we had some 130 plans in the past 30 years but none of them were realized because of the approach of the other side israel mottaki said during a panel discussion
4355007 besides we do not see any chance for the success of
4355008 its an arab issue and should be resolved within the arab fold he said
4355009 one of the things youve got to do to arabs is hit them between the eyes with a big stick
4355010 our friends and allies like israel and the moderate arab states
4355011 saudis talk with 7 u s oil firms companies were kicked out in 1970s
4355012 the most active in diverting the president from any actions detrimental to saudi interests
4355013 cheney trips up the vice presidents middle east expedition didnt help the war on terror
4355014 us firms say timetable may slip on saudi gas deals
4355015 there is reason to believe the status of the negotiations will be monitored at the highest levels of the us government the department of state announced mar 1 that elizabeth cheney daughter of vice pres dick cheney would join the bureau of near eastern affairs in coming weeks as the deputy assistant secretary handling middle east economic issues
4355016 the highly significant speech delivered today to the veterans of foreign wars by vice president cheney
4355017 that opposing saddam hussein would cause even greater troubles in that part of the world i believe the opposite is true regime change in iraq would bring about a number of benefits for the region the reality is that these times bring not only dangers but also opportunities
4355018 the streets of basra and baghdad are sure to erupt in joy
4355019 you got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
4355020 all the surrounding countries especially those that have large shia populations will be in all likelihood destabilised
4355021 dahlan is leading a group of fatah members who are trying to topple the hamas government on orders from the israelis and americans
4355022 the american zionist scheme is aimed at eliminating the infrastructure of the palestinian resistance groups and forcing the palestinians to make political concessions
4355023 we cherish the great role played by the religious establishment headed by grand ayatollah sayed ali al sistani in preserving the unity of iraq and the blood of iraqis and in helping them building a political system based on the constitution and law
4355024 the first promising step for free and direct bilateral talks
4355025 we have already seen a change in policy towards iran
4355026 it is now firmly back in the hands of the department of state
4355027 wishful thinking and unsubstantiated assertions flavored with a healthy dose of ad hominem attack against any who question him
4355028 so how exactly do you figure out when something is real and when its a deception
4355029 shield protecting the zionist enemy israel against the strikes of the mujahedeen in lebanon
4355030 liberating the centers of learning in najaf and karbala in the wake of saddams demise would offer the region and the west a chance to reinstate the traditional dynamic among lebanons shiites prying the lebanese shiites away from a defunct iranian revolution and reacquainting them with the iraqi shiite community could significantly help to shift the regions balance could be the catalyst for the implosion of assads regime in syria and though the shiite community of the islamic revolution in iran as well
4355031 i know my destiny and i know that i always play against my previous clubs
4355032 he is an affectionate guy but he takes his work very seriously and in training he is definitely a bit harder with us
4355033 he just wants the players to be dedicated though he doesnt want people playing around during the time we are meant to be working hard
4355034 i think we have everything necessary to win the premier league again and also the champions league
4355035 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4355036 we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now and look forward to sunderland we will not play as badly as that again we must improve and we will improve
4355037 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4355038 of course manchester united and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got
4355039 a lot of players enjoy being around bigger clubs and everything that goes with it they dont fancy a battle at a club like stoke
4355040 in my opinion the mechanism for ending the strife should be through the security council without that there will no solution
4355041 ignored the march of the iraqi people to build a free and democratic state
4355042 at the same time we hope that the regional conference due to be held in baghdad in march 10 will not be shadowed by such stands
4355043 we hope that the arab league will not be part of any dispute or quarrel inside iraq that might encourage some parties to take some arab countries to their sides to accomplish their political desires
4355044 a strategy for buying time for progress toward justice and reconciliation
4355045 these measures will not fix all of the problems in iraq but they will manifest the will of the entire government of iraq to be a government for all the people of iraq in the future
4355046 the most important thing is to achieve discussion of these plans time is irrelevant
4355047 i cant understand why these americans havent done anything to use our unpopularity against us
4355048 it strains credulity to say that no single 20 million investment has occurred in iran in the past decade driving any calendar year
4355049 the fact of the matter is that the state department refuses to find evidence of the investments that would trigger the act because they do not want to find evidence of such investments
4355050 what is the larger significance even if iranian assistance to an iraqi group is proven to everyones satisfaction the administrations policy never rested on that the policy is being driven by a much larger sense of iran as the prime bete noire in the region and that is why the administration is trying to put together these coalitions with saudi arabia egypt jordan the sunni states that weve been reading about none of this hinges on the iran dossier we are not going to call this off if we cant prove that iran is furnishing munitions to iraqi groups it is just one more thing along with the nuclear issue which is really more legitimate in a basic kind of way in the administrations case that iran is doing nasty things therefore its appropriate to beat the drum about iran thats what its come down to
4355051 zura will start for sure and we look forward to him playing
4355052 he gives us a real presence up front he can hold the ball up and get in behind hes quick so we think he can really be a benefit to the football team
4355053 its obviously fantastic to have zura ready to go for our first game of the season particularly given that it is a derby at home in a grand final re match its a pleasure to have him here as part of our club
4355054 kasey is arguably the top goalkeeper that the united states has ever produced
4355055 he is a natural leader and those leadership qualities should be of enormous value to sounders fc
4355056 when i started my career in europe i always said that i wanted to finish playing back at home in the us
4355057 no one wants anyone from perth in any sport to win it
4355058 no one used to like it when we were successful in the old nsl so theyre going on what happened in the previous season
4355059 its a new start this season and everyone starts on zero points so they can go on all they want about sydney or anyone else its up to us every time we step onto the park to prove them wrong
4355060 weve spoken about what we want to achieve this year and our main goal our first goal is to make the top four theres no ifs or buts about that its a must
4355061 once we get there well have another goal to make the grand final and then obviously to win it
4355062 i was at the a league launch in sydney and we were well and truly under the radar no one expects us to do very well well see what happens this year
4355063 within ourselves we want top four and thats what we will be striving for thats a realistic goal i believe we can achieve
4355064 a few of the overseas players no ones seen them play before theyre all new
4355065 a few of the other boys have come from state league teams from around the country so it our squad is a bit unknown i think we are a bit underestimated at the moment
4355066 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4355067 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4355068 this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4355069 hes got a definite point of difference hes great on set pieces exceptional on set pieces
4355070 hes a very laconic sort of character you dont get much out of him in terms of vocal input but his football i think will speak for itself
4355071 set pieces are something i work very hard on hopefully i can do a job for the team and add something to our attack
4355072 i played against him in the pre season cup and he gave me a good whack but id rather be copping a whack from him than watching him whack someone else
4355073 stuey musialik we wont be using in the game it would have been game four in nine days and its too big an ask ill probably look at using bridgey off the bench but ill see how he feels itll become his decision
4355074 youre never happy with a draw were going to come and play football were not going to try to kill the game off at all
4355075 hell be back in the country this afternoon friday and ill have a chat with him and see how he feels it will be his decision
4355076 i spoke to him in china after the cote divoire match and he said he felt ok but said he cramped up towards the end of the match and was facing a long flight home from tianjin
4355077 hopefully hell be able to come off the bench some time during the match
4355078 it would have been his fourth game in nine days
4355079 if kossie needs me im available i would love nothing more than make my sydney debut in a home match

4355086 if you can flip the syrians you will cure israels hezbollah problem
4355087 that they do have the ability to convince hamas to acknowledge israels right to exist
4355088 if we accomplish that that would give the ehud olmert a negotiating partner
4355089 he is a welcome participant in every meeting the president is in he sits in on almost all the policy meetings
4355090 they really are genuinely close friends but the president doesnt always take his advice
4355091 in iraq may still have some legs even as this is linked to an aggressive policy toward syria and iran
4355092 iraqi forces were not able to hold neighborhoods and the effort to build did not show up the sectarian violence continued to mount so we did not make the progress on security we had hoped we did not bring the moderate sunnis off the fence as we had hoped
4355093 by the time the unity government took over the cycle of sectarian violence had begun and they and we have not been able to get ahead of it
4355094 we know the u s is under great pressure from arabic and islamic countries who are sunni
4355095 they fear the growing power of the shia inside iraq
4355096 and who is responsible for this reading it is the diplomatic channel that is khalilzad
4355097 in beloved iraq blood is being shed among brothers in the shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and ugly sectarianism threatens civil war
4355098 we dont think there is an illegal occupation because these forces are present and working according to international resolutions and are accepted by a representative elected iraqi government
4355099 they have the same cars the same weapons the same uniforms as the police just instead of ip it is written fps
4355100 a democrat might not be as different as you would think
4355101 was involved in the operation the iraqi said in a clear reference to the mahdi army the militia controlled by the breakaway shiite cleric moktada al sadr
4355102 i hear that there are a number of commando and assassination squads that are disconnected and controlled directly by iran
4355103 they have supplied jam and others with significant weaponry and training
4355104 it makes sense that if somebodys trying to harm our troops or stop us from achieving our goal or killing innocent citizens in iraq that we will stop them
4355105 we just want to make sure there are no seams between what were doing politically and what were doing militarily secretary rumsfeld and i are going to be there together because a lot of the work that has to be done is at that juncture between political and military

4355114 we need to legislate the mechanism and the rules inside in the parliament and that is supposed to take place in the coming few weeks
4355115 but i think there is much room for criticism because undoubtedly there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the united states in iraq
4355116 upon reading the transcript of my appearance on al jazeera i realized that i seriously misspoke by using the phrase there has been arrogance and stupidity by the u s in iraq
4355117 this represents neither my views nor those of the state department i apologize
4355118 the baathist party and other insurgency factions are ready to negotiate with the americans

4355122 i have something of a hunch that the second administration will be quite different from the first
4355123 oh a lot of it is crazy stuff about israel such as israel is taking over iraq
4355124 the bush administration now appears to be ready for more of the same reports
4355125 you have to go after both sunni and shia neighborhoods
4355126 together forward was mostly focused on sunni neighborhoods and weve got to do both
4355127 there are some extreme elements of the mehdi army and we will go after them i will allow the government to decide whether sadr is part of it or not he is currently working within the political system
4355128 the american government must give the iraqi government complete sovereignty which means that the iraqi army will have the authority to strike the takfiri baathists with an iron hand without any interference from the americans
4355129 i definitely dont know anyone who would want to fight in iraq

4355137 there is no way that the oil majors would support the actual partition of iraq this is a bluff

4355143 our ambassador did a great job getting the constitution amended before they voted on it
4355144 as iraqis prepare to vote their consciences in the coming referendum leaders who have led the democratic process and
4355145 i affirm that this government represents the will of the people and no one has the right to impose a timetable on it
4355146 he is viewed by people as a bureaucratic back stabber a casey man he rose through the ranks by staying in washington and playing games
4355147 mr schroeder asked in the context of soaring eu gas imports mentioning algeria libya qatar nigeria and
4355148 you have to think if this would be politically better than russia my view is that as far as security and stability of supply goes russia is the best option
4355149 and then maybe we wouldnt see those stupid boring home items anymore
4355150 raised so many different passions among the lebanese public due to the history of our involvement in that country
4355151 we are engage elsewhere in the world in afghanistan in iraq in the far east were certainly doing our share for global stability
4355152 most of our combat ready divisions are in iraq or afghanistan or on their way or coming back the generals dont like it because were already way overstretched
4355153 favor the projection of us military power anywhere and everywhere
4355154 i cannot talk with you i havent joined a party and no militia is protecting me
4355155 we as fadhila we want to make our province our own region
4355156 we have two million people an airport a port and oil everything we need to be a state
4355157 as far as boots on the ground that doesnt seem to be in the cards
4355158 i do not think that it is anticipated that u s ground forces are expected for that force
4355159 no war in 2004 meaning no serious counter insurgency activity that might produce us casualties such a rumor seems to have been given some support by the timing of the us assault on fallujah which seemed to have been on hold for much of 2004 until bushs election was secured
4355160 were in a low grade war with iranian and syrian terrorists
4355161 the decisions did not get made that should have been they didnt get made in a timely fashion and the differences were argued out endlessly at the end of the day you have to hold the president responsible i dont think he realized the extent of the opposition within his own administration and the disloyalty
4355162 not much different from what his father did on february 15 1991 when he called the iraqi people to rise up and then had second thoughts and didnt do anything once they did
4355163 it came down to convincing cheney and others that if we are going to confront iran we first have to check off the box
4355164 the administration cant have it both ways they cant embrace the regime and still talk about liberty for the iranian people
4355165 can spout whatever platitudes she wants to spout but at this point when it comes to liberty and freedom she has no credibility the bush administration is in full retreat
4355166 rich saudi and persian gulf financiers work to consolidate the region as a jihadist base
4355167 interoperability among devices from multiple manufacturers is important for consumer adoption of superspeed usb products
4355168 usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4355169 they have both signed the agreement to use our spec instead and will not develop and alternate version
4355170 its a shame that it took the reality of an alternative spec to make this come true intel should have opened it up without this one has to question a monopolist leading a spec like this in the future
4355171 the bargain being struck here is economic reform by iraq in return for financial support
4355172 we know what it takes it takes partnerships with international oil companies
4355173 the oil companies have told us they need to know what the rules of the road are
4355174 iraq needs investment iraq needs to send a strong signal to the international community about investment in oil
4355175 this is the beginning of the plan to divide iraq
4355176 we had hoped that the problems of sectarian violence would be resolved
4355177 there is a huge conspiracy supervised by the u s occupation to target the sadrists
4355178 instead we will prepare for the elections and when we take control of local governments we will not allow federalism

4355181 the installation of a minority maronite christian government to rule over a lebanese protectorate which would conclude a separate peace with israel
4355182 the weak link in the arab coalition is lebanon a christian state must be established whose southern border will be the litani we shall sign a treaty with it
4355183 a terrorist group obligingly furnished israel with at least a shadowy casus belli by shooting in the head an israeli envoy post in london
4355184 are the most pro american arabs in the middle east
4355185 blowing the hell out of them and america isnt taking one step to protect them
4355186 the whole arab world is going to look and see that hariri has been sacrificed on the altar of israeli power
4355187 wipe israel off the map and supersize my order for plutonium
4355188 wipe israel off the map and supersize my order for plutonium
4355189 generally the shia leadership here have behaved more as iraqi patriots and have not reacted in the way that perhaps the iranians and hezbollah might want them to
4355190 sadrs own complicity in a purge of more radical anti us sadrist factional players
4355191 baathist officials in from cold as us does u turn
4355192 spokesman for abdel karim al mohammedawi widely known as the prince of the marshes
4355193 that shed further light on the relationship between bolanis patron muhammadawi prince of the marsh arabs and ahmad chalabi
4355194 would you mind talking with me about some of the things you do that you found really helped you to get to where you are today with your client load
4355195 jamie i like what you have shown me and i would like you to train me
4355196 i would like you to train me 5 times a week
4355197 i wont get out of bed for less than 10000 a day
4355198 we think thats very important to do as a political signal
4355199 we should do what we can to encourage a democratic alternative to saddam hussein
4355200 and above all we should not accept the replacement of saddam hussein with another general who will run yet one more authoritarian iraqi regime
4355201 easy to argue for the breakup of iraq especially if you are paid by the kurdistan regional government
4355202 if you have significant interests in some norwegian oil companies
4355203 look a little bit more into motivations of some of these breakup theories
4355204 the time has come for us to be courageous enough to admit that there were massive mistakes in de baathification
4355205 has to focus on individuals who are charged with specific crimes not whole classes and groups of people
4355206 no sign the white house has done any strategic re thinking
4355207 there is going to come a time when i would argue we are going to have to force this issue
4355208 i can tell you in every single ministry how they are using that ministry to fill the coffers of the political parties
4355209 there is no cohesion in the government to help him there are so many circles he needs to take into consideration when he wants to make a decision
4355210 mowaffaqs constituency is cnn bbc and the arabic satellite network al jazeera
4355211 the minister will discuss with chinese companies fulfilling previous contracts signed with the former regime
4355212 one hears word of mouth but one has to see it with ones own eyes
4355213 considerable physical evidence of it and just about everyone in al amarah knew about it
4355214 i n recent weeks haass has been peddling to administration officials recommendations gleaned from a policy paper titled aptly enough
4355215 there is linkage to the situation between the israelis and palestinians
4355216 chalabi agitated for direct elections and restoration of iraqi sovereignty he clashed with meghan osullivan now deputy national security adviser for iraq when she worked to undermine and eventually reverse de baathification
4355217 new national security advisor stephen hadleys decision to remove richard haass prot g meghan osullivan from the iran portfolio she retains her position as senior director for iraq at the national security council also bodes well for a more activist policy especially as the new national security team again reviews washingtons policy or lack thereof toward tehran osullivan had long been both dismissive of iranian dissidents and a proponent of engaging the islamic republic
4355218 the iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives
4355219 there has been some pulling back of the extremes of neo cons
4355220 this is a man whos really driven to seek re election and done a lot of things with that in mind
4355221 i have something of a hunch that the second administration will be quite different from the first
4355222 im a true believer in the process of democratization as a way to overcome old wounds and i believe that if we dont do that then people who have had their differences people who have resolved their differences by violence or by repression are never going to find a way to live peacefully together
4355223 is it really priority number one in terms of philosophically and pragmatically for the united states to be spreading democracy around the world
4355224 well first of all the united states is not spreading democracy the united states is standing with those who want a democratic future
4355225 the countries that we are meeting is a group that you would expect to support the emerging moderate forces in lebanon in iraq and in the palestinian territories
4355226 i want the saudis involvement in the stabilization of iraq
4355227 saudi arabia has a lot of standing with a number of the forces in iraq and they have actually been very helpful in trying to get sunnis involved in the election
4355228 so i think it would be very helpful if they were supportive of and working toward helping prime minister nuri national reconciliation plan
4355229 they can rally people around the national reconciliation government they have a lot of contacts among the tribes
4355230 they have already been helpful id like them to continue to be helpful
4355231 w hile the royal family the government and the moneyed elite all live on the western red sea side of the country the oil is located on the eastern persian gulf side
4355232 you touch rumsfeld my mentor the man who gave me my start in life during the nixon and ford administrations and you lose my cooperation
4355233 gives the impression that it exonerates israel of responsibility for the crimes
4355234 hizbollah had some observations over the discussion of their disarmament
4355235 disarmament of all armed groups in lebanon so that pursuant to the lebanese cabinet decision of july 27 2006 there will be no weapons or authority in lebanon other than the lebanese state
4355236 we believe that the initiatives proposed so far by the various parties to achieve a cease fire are divided into two parts
4355237 the first part includes a halt to the zionist attack and any other item which would gather a consensus from all lebanese
4355238 do not enjoy the approval of all parties and this would be solved through future negotiations
4355239 in implying he had reservations about lebanese prime minister fouad sinioras seven point plan to end the fighting between israel and hezbollah
4355240 may recommend carving up iraq into three highly autonomous regions
4355241 change them by all means decapitate them even but very quickly get the arms and legs moving
4355242 it is not possible to venture or to start the application of federalism now
4355243 we entered this government to use it as a weapon to make pressure on the occupiers
4355244 its possible they lost people and cared but they were not stirred by it
4355245 be expected to make in their daily lives in their daily routines
4355246 our hope of course is that they make no sacrifice whatsoever
4355247 never would have occurred if every voters sons and daughters were eligible for the draft
4355248 relapse into a self centeredness that became a second national tragedy
4355249 a call to work together on some effort greater than ourselves
4355250 fear factor to american idol or from pamela anderson to paris hilton
4355251 our much maligned commercial popular culture may also be the most potent weapon in battling jihadists
4355252 relapse into a self centeredness that became a second national tragedy
4355253 all of that worrying and heart ache for some pride
4355254 for the arab moderates and for the europeans some sense of progress and momentum on the arab israeli dispute is just a sine qua non for their ability to co operate actively with the united states on a lot of other things that we care about
4355255 do not want to endure the kind of isolation that theyre headed toward
4355256 i do not believe were going to find iranian moderates the question is are we going to find iranian reasonables
4355257 the eclipse of right zionist influence and the triumph of the old right arabist establishment 1 october 7 2006 10 27 am oclock
4355258 the president cant be talking about troop reductions as a centerpiece
4355259 withdrawal of u s troops will become like salted peanuts to the american public the more u s troops come home the more will be demanded
4355260 the path to 9 11 was a calculated piece of political theater and kristol is candid enough to acknowledge the flip side
4355261 our world is much less safe today than it was on september 11
4355262 would threaten the dhahran region in saudi arabia and might give iran a new base to seek to dominate the gulf region
4355263 it is often asserted that what is needed in relation to iran is a diplomacy comparable to that which in the 1970s moved china from hostility to cooperation with the united states the challenge of the iranian negotiation is far more complex if tehran insists on combining the persian imperial tradition with contemporary islamic fervor then a collision with america and indeed with its negotiating partners of the six is unavoidable at the same time an iran concentrating on the development of the talents of its people and the resources of its country should have nothing to fear from the united states a proper approach toward iran would imply the redefinition of the objective of regime change providing an opportunity for a genuine change in direction by iran whoever is in power
4355264 i am only happy to receive questions about religious matters
4355265 honestly i think not he is very angry very disappointed
4355266 he asked the politicians to ask the americans to make a timetable for leaving but they disappointed him
4355267 after the war the politicians were visiting him every month if they wanted to do something they visited him but no one has visited him for two or three months he is very angry that this is happening now he sees this as very bad
4355268 i say we dont need to visit anyone as a government an independent government that should be making its decisions on its own not based on directions from a religious authority
4355269 national salvation government which we call a military coup government
4355270 canceling the constitution canceling the results of the elections and going back to square one and we will not accept that
4355271 iraqis are sticking to the principles of the constitution and democracy
4355272 its a critical moment we want to be sure that we understand perfectly whats going on and what is the real strategy of the united states in iraq
4355273 we read in the press about different perspectives and attitudes thats why we want to be clear whether there is a plan b
4355274 bush holds to rhetoric of no appeasement as critics fred over failures
4355275 what michael moore and the neocons dont know about saudi arabia
4355276 at the end of operation desert storm in 1991 a s much as saddams neighbors wanted to see him gone they feared iraq would fragment in ways that would play into the hands of islamic fundamentalists in iran
4355277 to the contrary were happy because hes a martyr and hes now in heaven
4355278 the government in baghdad was giving a lot of support and money to basra but the governor mohammed al waili was misusing it and that led to violence and a lot of strikes including walkouts by the military and police
4355279 what happened in basra is that ayatollah representative talked about the corruption created by the governor and his administration which caused the governor to say that the religious offices were responsible for all the violence in basra and that we are dividing people against themselves
4355280 they should be more responsible in their proclamations now the problem has been solved by the sadr office
4355281 asaad kareem president of the iraqi oil workers union in basra
4355282 the focus on basra by the media and the rulers in baghdad is not justified and has a political motivation behind it they want to divert attention from the bad situations in baghdad and the sunni triangle
4355283 these efforts will not help the city but they may indeed open the door to a crisis in security
4355284 provided they were legitimate and focused on improving services to ordinary citizens of basra
4355285 divert attention from the bad situations in baghdad and the sunni triangle
4355286 asaad kareem president of the iraqi oil workers union in basra
4355287 hassan jumaa awad al assadi president of the general union of oil employees in basra
4355288 federalism is a form of governance that has had a place in the history of islam and which it allows
4355289 the ministry isnt committed to oil investment contracts signed in the past
4355290 see we were supposed to be fighting the actual war on terror but we didnt instead we were distracted by a cabal of neoconservatives into fighting the wrong war in iraq now our real enemies are on the rise again in afghanistan and pakistan
4355291 in afghanistan we see al qaedas vision for the world afghanistans people have been brutalized we condemn the taliban regime
4355292 by aiding and abetting murder the taliban regime is committing murder
4355293 with respect to the nature of the regime in afghanistan that is not uppermost in our minds right now im not going to say that it has become one of the objectives of the united states government to either remove or put in place a different regime
4355294 ensure that the campaign ends with the ouster of the taliban
4355295 be cautious and focus on bin laden and his al qaeda network
4355296 at the beginning of the session you said you were an independent group he said
4355297 but almost everything that i was asked came from a government position
4355298 the emergence of a shia crescent running from tehran to beirut
4355299 an aerial attack on irans nuclear facilities lies just beyond the horizon of diplomacy with the crisis advancing and the moment of truth approaching it is important to begin looking now with unflinching honesty at the military option
4355300 they are doing it but they do not know it

4355303 questa squadra mi ha ridato la felicit quello che ho qui non lo trovo da nessunaltra parte al mondo resto fino a 34 anni e poi chiudo in bellezza
4355304 i soldi non sono tutto con tutto il rispetto per quelli che non ne hanno ma io ne ho e che me ne faccio di volerne di pi adesso se sento pressione la pressione ce lho addosso da quando sono nato ogni partita devo sempre dimostrare qualcosa perch se ne sbaglio una sono tutti l col cannocchiale anche quando vado in mezzo alla strada devo dimostrare alla gente che cosa non sono ci sono abituato a queste cose ora mi interessa solo star bene fisicamente in campo non devo imparare niente da nessuno
4355305 cosa mi ha spinto a restare alla samp veramente il parere determinante era di marotta che ci ha messo il grano non mio a parte tutto qui ho trovato quello che non avevo mai trovato in dieci anni di calcio c una societ che mi fa sentire importante a partire dal presidente che mi vuole un bene dellanima in pi ho trovato il direttore la prima persona nel mondo del calcio che mi capisce e tutti i suoi collaboratori appena sbaglio qualcosa mi mandano un messaggino per farmi sentire che mi sono vicini non mi era mai capitato voglio rimanere qui ancora per tanto anche perch il direttore lo sa che dal momento che mi manda via gli metto la gente contro
4355306 se sono pronto allora per diventare una bandiera della samp lunica bandiera della sampdoria mancini io forse tra sei o sette anni potrei avvicinarmi a quello che lui ha rappresentato per questa squadra poi la parola bandiera spesso sfocia nellipocrisia ne sento tanti che la pronunciano ma poi voglio vedere se gli danno dieci euro
4355307 io ho rinunciato a tanti soldi per la felicit che non ha prezzo la felicit lho trovata qui anche se ho giocato nel club pi importante del mondo il real madrid dove molti pagherebbero per poter andare ma la samp per me la squadra pi importante mi ha dato la vita la fiducia mi ha fatto tornare il sorriso con tutto il rispetto per quelli che ne hanno pochi i soldi contano poco per me
4355308 mi sento migliorato come uomo se prima facevo dieci cavolate al giorno ora ne faccio cinque ma non sono cambiato la mia indole questa anche se giusto che negli anni uno migliori altrimenti della vita non hai capito niente come giocatore invece s mi sento diverso a 18 19 anni ero pi solista facevo un sacco di numeri ora invece abbino la fantasia al contesto della squadra come dice sempre mazzarri
4355309 non stato tutelato nonostante abbia vinto pi di tutti in nerazzurro negli ultimi ventanni e un grande un altro di quelli che dice sempre quel che pensa
4355310 mi piace molto anche se abbiamo perso un giocatore importante come maggio sono arrivati per due sostituti forti pi un giocatore di prospettiva come dessena e un acquisto per me azzeccatissimo come bottinelli manca qualcosa non lo so so solo che se a marotta gli dai met dei soldi che spende corvino vinciamo tre scudetti di fila lui il cassano dei direttori sportivi
4355311 possiamo fare bene lottare di nuovo per la uefa come lanno scorso il mio sogno per portare questi colori in champions nel giro di due tre anni sarebbe come vincere un mondiale il primo giorno a genova non lo scorder mai mi hanno accolto quattro cinque mila persone proprio quando avevo chiesto affetto loro sono la mia gente io sono il loro calciatore
4355312 quanti gol prometto per me non sono importanti se mi dicono che a fine anno avr fatto quaranta assist e zero gol io dico che va bene mi piace vedere i compagni sorridere loro sono la mia vera forza perch se non corrono per me io la palla la becco ben poche volte
4355313 se ho mai pensato di andar via le sirene non suonano se non le fai suonare dipende sempre dal calciatore quando suonano vuol dire che uno vuole fare cassa e a me i soldi non interessano lho detto al direttore restiamo qua a vita io e lui poi io a 34 anni smetto e vediamo che succede io un giorno lallenatore della sampdoria ma che allenatore se guido la squadra io becchiamo dieci gol a partita magari ci divertiamo davanti ma becchiamo dieci gol a partita
4355314 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structures that the public can feel reassured about
4355315 we dont want the collapse of georgia but the de facto situation is such that neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them
4355316 that we support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia we will not only support them but guarantee them in the caucasus and in the whole world right is on your side
4355317 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks
4355318 any reference to the territorial integrity of georgia would simply be seen as an insult a deeply human insult
4355319 je me dis que jai rendez vous avec lhistoire avec moi m me et avec un d fi
4355320 le d fi cest d tre junior et dagrafer les trois titres seniors jen ai d j deux champion deurope et du monde alors si je pouvais terminer par le plus beau ce serait super je pr f re lannoncer comme a a vacue la pression mais franchement je crois que jai en moi une barri re anti pression jai un truc r aliser a moi de jouer
4355321 jai h te que a commence que ce soit mon tour dautant que mon corps me dit
4355322 il a les d fauts de sa jeunesse cest tout si tant est que cela soit un d faut
4355323 il peut y avoir un manque dexp rience ou de mauvaises d cisions tactiques mais il est d j tellement exp riment pour son ge que pour linstant ce nest jamais arriv physiquement il est au dessus de tout le monde tactiquement il est d j abouti m me sil a encore beaucoup de choses apprendre mais cest normal
4355324 cest incroyable je suis toute retourn e jamais je naurais pens conna tre un tel moment dans ma vie
4355325 en fait jai pens que javais r ussi contr ler libby trickett mais je navais aucune id e de ce qui se passait dans les autres lignes deau car je ne voyais rien sur ma gauche elle tait couloir 7 finalement je me suis rendu compte que javais gagn et tout est devenu magnifique je ne ressentais plus aucune douleur
4355326 dans ma carri re sportive cest certainement le plus beau moment quelque chose de diff rent que de nager un record du monde
4355327 if we could get some adult supervision right now in the administration with respect to their war strategy this could be handled
4355328 i believe that if president bush woke up tomorrow and said that he would substitute
4355329 in many ways the nations response to war has been tepid
4355330 we are much closer to the beginning than the end of this long conflict
4355331 ultimately victory requires a national strategic consensus evident in both words and actions
4355332 let there be no mistake our soldiers effectiveness in battle both today and tomorrow ultimately depends on a national commitment to recruit train equip and support them and their families properly
4355333 this is a matter of national priorities not a matter of affordability
4355334 if we just keep the supplementals up that it will compensate for this pressure
4355335 theres very strict rules for supplementals they have to be tied to consumption in the fight and that does not transform you it just attempts to keep you where you were
4355336 es permitido al hombre repudiar a su mujer por cualquier causa
4355337 no hab is le do que el creador desde el principio
4355338 por esto dejar el hombre a su padre y a su madre y se unir a su mujer y ser n los dos una sola carne
4355339 de modo que ya no son dos sino una carne pues bien lo que dios junt el hombre no lo separe
4355340 entonces por qu mois s prescribi dar libelo de repudio y despacharla
4355341 a causa de la dureza de vuestros corazones os permiti mois s repudiar a vuestras mujeres pero al principio no fue as mas yo os digo quien repudia a su mujer salvo el caso de adulterio y se casa con otra comete adulterio y el que se casa con una repudiada comete adulterio
4355342 si tal es la condici n del hombre con la mujer no conviene casarse
4355343 no todos pueden comprender esta palabra sino solamente aquellos a quienes es dado porque hay eunucos que nacieron as del seno materno y hay eunucos hechos por los hombres y hay eunucos que se hicieron tales a s mismos por el reino de los cielos el que pueda entender entienda
4355344 this is not something that was dreamed up by somebody at the last minute and done at the insistence of the people in baghdad it was discussed
4355345 although we havent ruled anything out jon thats still one of the things we are looking at
4355346 if we are able to promote representative representative government not necessarily democracy in a number of nations in the middle east and bring more freedom to the people of that part of the world it will have been a success
4355347 baker wants to believe that sunni dictators in sunni majority states are representative
4355348 there has been some pulling back of the extremes of neo cons
4355349 this is a man whos really driven to seek re election and done a lot of things with that in mind
4355350 i have something of a hunch that the second administration will be quite different from the first
4355351 its huge that we get to get one of them out this week
4355352 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4355353 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4355354 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4355355 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4355356 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4355357 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4355358 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4355359 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4355360 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4355361 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4355362 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4355363 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4355364 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4355365 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4355366 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4355367 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4355368 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4355369 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4355370 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4355371 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2
4355372 nous avons la tristesse de vous faire part du d c s de daniela turowicz
4355373 ich war mir ganz sicher dass es nicht schief gehen w rde allerdings
4355374 nach einer kurzen z gerlichen phase haben allerdings sehr schnell die meisten kollegen gelernt
4355375 ist er nicht toll dieser olympische geist manchmal hab ich das gef hl es ist eher ein gespenst eines das sendern weltweit vorschreiben kann wie sie ihre nachrichten im nachhinein zu manipulieren haben
4355376 da wurden urspr nglich zwei d rfer aufeinander gehetzt das ist schon so etwas wie kriegsersatz daher ist ein schuss eben ein schuss und ein angriff ist ein angriff
4355377 there is strong activity in each of our major markets and we expect an improved performance in the current year
4355378 the others detained were three americans who were acting as support and to ensure the safety of the climbers and engage with the authorities
4355379 as an experience rock climber and mountaineer phil learned about the injustices in tibet through the climbing community
4355380 last year phil was horrified to learn that tibetan refugees had been shot and killed by chinese border authorities as they crossed nangpala pass in an attempt to flee to nepal
4355381 the shootings were captured on tape by climbers at cho oyu base camp on mount everest
4355382 it was at that time when phil decided to get involved with the tibetan freedom movement and realised he could use his climbing skills in his effort to support the tibetan people
4355383 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4355384 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
4355385 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and we are seeking further details
4355386 obviously youre always worried when your child is arrested especially abroad but we are also very proud of what he is doing for the tibetan people i am very pleased he is highlighting their plight
4355387 china seems so normal when you watch the olympics on television but you cant say what you want to say there
4355388 i know he practised beforehand to make sure they would be as safe as possible they wanted to do the protest peacefully but it is always a worry
4355389 ordinary outgoing person who loves climbing and is passionate about the tibetan cause
4355390 we think it was either fatah al islam or some unknown forces
4355391 dont stand here any longer because you can be shot from the top of the side road
4355392 this is alawi owned bullet holes in the door this is alawi the same these are sunni shops all burnt out
4355393 they want to sell guns so here everyone needs a gun because everyone is frightened so the place has filled up with guns the army does nothing why not dont they know the names of the gangs dont they know who is behind this
4355394 the investigation into the murders of benjamin and catherine mullany has been ongoing this morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at st johns court having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information as the inquiry continues however further information will be provided in due course
4355395 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned
4355396 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4355397 while the market is generally aware of cost pressures throughout the industry we are concerned that there is a tendency to underestimate the quantum of cost increases
4355398 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4355399 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4355400 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4355401 apples market share is bigger than bmws or mercedess or porsches in the automotive market whats wrong with being bmw or mercedes
4355402 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4355403 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4355404 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4355405 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4355406 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4355407 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4355408 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4355409 i think it should be possible to have this resolution before too long
4355410 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4355411 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4355412 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4355413 in my judgement this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality
4355414 i had to be sure that i had somebody i could win with
4355415 i was proud of my crime it was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against injustice
4355416 because the story answers to most of the myths and preconceptions westerners already have about soviet life the problem will be to make sure that students read it with the same degree of resistance with which they would normally confront any other piece of fiction
4355417 discuss the meaning of ritual suicide among the yoruba as it is explained in soyinkas play
4355418 without any censorship in the west fashionable trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable nothing is forbidden but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges

4355421 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4355422 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so
4355423 the securityfocus vulnerability database for example delivers an invaluable service by providing security professionals with the most up to date information on vulnerabilities for all platforms and services
4355424 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4355425 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the us but other countries as well
4355426 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
4355427 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4355428 i wasnt good enough to play for villa at that time i agreed with the coaches completely
4355429 i wasnt ready or good enough to play in the premier league it was in their interests to let me go and it was in my interests to leave and get some first team football
4355430 i had to wait a while until the right opportunity came along but it did in the end with hull and i was privileged to join this club
4355431 i was sad not to make the grade but these things happen in life and football i thought i needed to try to play my way up the levels
4355432 our first two in the championship were so difficult definitely not the same as the high flying success we enjoyed last season
4355433 but i can understand why youre saying its like a fairytale weve come from the bottom division to the top division in the space of five years and it is a massive achievement when you think about it
4355434 ill be playing in my fourth division with hull but thats the sort of thing you sit down and reflect on when youve finished playing not now right now i just want to get out there and play
4355435 i really wanted to play at wembley so even though we were a bit disappointed not to finish in the top two i was delighted to be going there and everyone said its the best way to go up anyway
4355436 we went to the stadium the night before the game and it looked a lot more intimidating when it was empty bigger than it did the next day when all the fans were in it
4355437 but on the day it just kind of felt like home i was very relaxed and i really enjoyed the game it was probably the most relaxed ive ever been for such a big game in my career
4355438 deano delivered as he always does and it was just brilliant a great day the achievement probably still hasnt sunk in i dont think it will until saturday when we start playing premier league fixtures
4355439 when the fixtures came out i just sat with my wife and thought how surreal it all is but its reality and weve now got to get on with it
4355440 i know it sounds a stupid thing to say but the one game im absolutely desperate to play in is aston villa away and its not until quite late on 2 may
4355441 im not so bothered about the home game in december i just massively want to play at villa park
4355442 all three of them were absolutely incredible to me while i was there
4355443 some of the things i saw them do were just amazing and it was a real privilege for a young lad to learn from goalkeepers like them
4355444 james was naturally very athletic but schmeichel he was just the greatest goalkeeper of all time to get to train with him regularly that was never going to do me any harm
4355445 sometimes it could be a bit frustrating because i thought ill never be able to do that but then you realise not many other keepers would have been able to either so it was a big honour
4355446 bueno en principio no me molesta si es una burla de alg n tipo a lo mejor s pero si s lo es una broma no
4355447 yo s que los espa oles hacen el gesto para hacerse los chinos porque he estudiado en espa a pero la mayor a de la poblaci n china no lo sabe
4355448 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4355449 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4355450 this probably accounts for more colourectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4355451 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4355452 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colourectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colourectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4355454 various achievements are very heartening to all of us but we must continue to heighten our vigilance

4355460 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team

4355474 i wonder if those paying homage here really understand the meaning of war
4355475 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4355476 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the 298 votes needed for a simple majority
4355477 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated
4355478 well stay in the opposition and play a constructive role so the peace process remains on track
4355479 i was going in too deep its not nice coming up like a big fish with your sinuses full of salt water
4355480 im feeling pretty sore but not from anything youd normally get from bungy just from hitting the water

4355502 the mall has something really positive to offer something that has nothing to do with shopping
4355503 i dont know thats what i moved there to find out
4355504 opaque gray oatmeal mixed with the contents of a lint trap
4355505 i felt this vacation like euphoria that ive never felt till then or since then
4355506 it was better for me than any nature walk ive every taken
4355507 but it only works if you dont bring any money or your cellphone
4355508 for so many people the mall was the first place they got to see the world
4355509 the first place they spent their own money the first place they met somebody who wasnt in their neighborhood the first time they saw things from music to fashion that previous to that their only connection to it had been on tv
4355510 were living on a planet thats going to hell in a handbag
4355511 at the mall you enter a condition of perfect climate control where its clean and orderly and you are not forced in any way to confront reality
4355512 we wanted to bring our child to have its birthday there we wanted to have the babys first steps in the mall
4355513 so intrigued by the apartment that they went to see it themselves

4355553 i supported hillary in the primaries and wont be voting for obama unless he makes her his vp at the convention in two weeks
4355554 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4355555 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4355556 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4355557 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did

4355559 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4355560 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4355561 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4355562 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4355563 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4355564 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4355565 ruan understands that he has to prove himself as any player would all hes looking for is an opportunity to do so in what he feels is his strongest position
4355566 hes not enjoying his rugby at the moment and doesnt want to become the next brent russell
4355567 he doesnt want to go overseas i have to stress that
4355568 from a springboks perspective peter de villiers sees him as the number four scrumhalf in the country
4355569 he wants the opportunity to work himself up to number one and he can only achieve that by playing regularly in that position for his union he totally understands that he is surplus to requirements now but he wants to play his way back into contention
4355570 he has to play scrumhalf for the sharks or hes gone
4355571 if i looked at reserve scrumhalf and i have to choose between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez and i sent fourie back i would have to have my head read
4355572 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn i told ruan and frans it is great to have you here but if fourie or jaque are back then you are at the back of the queue again
4355573 i told them you can go back and decide where you want to play
4355574 ruan is a very good player but as a scrumhalf i have to ask if he does all the basic things that a scrumhalf has to do this is what i look for and i have to be honest about these things if ruan and frans were playing badly then it would be easier but they arent playing badly
4355575 staying calm and composed is a huge part of his game he takes everything in his stride
4355576 but i really think what makes him such a great player is that he always seems to be in control of what he is doing

4355584 many of these people have been confined to camps for years

4355588 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4355589 extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists at an undisclosed location
4355590 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented
4355591 we have a bigfoot come look at my convincing scientific evidence and 8x10 glossy photos sorry press only bigfoots is serious business
4355592 aw i was scammed its not a bigfoot they told me it was but it isnt

4355595 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4355596 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4355597 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4355598 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4355599 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4355600 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4355601 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2
4355602 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and sorrow ive brought you
4355603 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because i dont know if i am worthy

4355605 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4355606 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats

4355621 when it comes down to it brendan has to make a decision thats right for him and his family it could be new york but we hope he explores the blues as a viable option
4355622 but the ones that have contacted my agent have all been told the same thing my focus remains on working something out with new york and were still talking with rangers general manager glen sather
4355623 its depth its experience we feel that we have a good base of experience with the veterans we have but if you can improve its a good thing the thing about brendan hes a very mature hockey player hes won championships with good organizations when people like that are available you have to explore it and try and improve your team and also the player has had some history here
4355624 if you had two people and one was a guy who the fans didnt know and the other one was brendan shanahan youd go with brendan the people here know him
4355625 hes in a position now where hes had a fair amount of interest from different organizations
4355626 were waiting to see what the rangers are going to do one factor that seems to be the main domino is what free agent mats sundin does its an intriguing scenario
4355627 we want our young players to graduate to the next level were trying to surround them in the right atmosphere and brendan could be a big part of that were still going to play a lot of youth well just see how it goes
4355628 id like to be in the next batman even though i am busy killing machines and people
4355629 i hope to god that they dont try to replace heath and have the joker
4355630 that would take years of preparation its tough heath set the bar at a new level which i think is fantastic for comic book lovers and movie lovers he changed the face of what people expect out of those films if you watch the old ones i mean they were great for what they were having danny elfmans music but this is a new level
4355631 brian austin green just putting it out there that hed play the riddler in the next batman movie

4355636 here i express on behalf of the nation deep remorse and humble condolences for all of the people who fell victim
4355637 i prayed for the souls of those who offered their lives for the country to rest in peace
4355638 its nonsense that neither prime minister fukuda or the emperor are paying homage
4355639 the others were acting as support and to ensure the safety of the climbers and engage with the authorities
4355640 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4355641 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
4355642 obviously youre always worried when your child is arrested especially abroad but we are also very proud of what he is doing for the tibetan people
4355643 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
4355644 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
4355645 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4355646 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
4355647 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
4355648 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches

4355660 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners

4355664 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4355665 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4355666 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4355667 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4355668 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4355669 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4355675 training camp is all about football theres no outside distractions frank talked to us last night and he said the one thing he loves is its all football and i started thinking because i think everyone feels like that
4355676 i think we could do training camp in vegas theres no question we could do it there
4355677 its been done before if youre asking me whats better id say its better to get away without question
4355678 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4355679 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4355680 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4355740 50 thousand se open beta accounts registered on the mythic account center will also be invited to join us for this stress test extravaganza
4355741 one week i went from barely playing against georgia then i played against florida atlantic when bobby got hurt and then coming in and starting against troy so it was all moving real fast
4355742 i know that im the guy right now and ive been that guy since the middle of last season
4355743 its a little bit different going through winter conditioning and summer conditioning as the starter whereas last year i was just another guy
4355744 i know the guys are looking at me as a leader so any chance i have i need to do that
4355745 there were only three players from what i understand that rushed for over 800 yards and threw for over 2 800 and one won the heisman trophy
4355746 i think that sums up the season he had statistically zac is a good person hes a good leader hes been a tremendous player for us on and off the field
4355747 hes not concerned with individual statistics hes more concerned with us winning football games were very excited about the upcoming season
4355748 the bottom line is that quarterbacks have to win games hopefully our goal is to win the south if we take care of our team goals all the individual goals and all that stuff will just take care of itself
4355749 overall from last year to this year the talent level is way higher this year
4355750 different guys step up each day thats what you see with a winning team everybody steps up
4355751 i relish every opportunity i get to influence the game
4355752 everything in this game is kind of contagious whether youre winning or losing
4355753 and even when you get that a lot of times you dont win eight in a row it is a fairly remarkable streak and something that we had to have because if were going to do anything this year we needed to do something like this
4355754 when you start playing like weve been playing you feel a little bit invincible
4355755 guys are anxious to go to the plate knowing we dont have to rely on one guy
4355756 when the ministry of justice bought the site back in march 2007 it set the alarms bells ringing
4355757 id say 95 of local people are opposed to the plans which is why we have organised the protest group and meeting
4355758 were worried because early indications are that cwmbran is the favourite place for the prison to be built
4355759 as a councillor and a mother im very concerned because we dont know the implications of having a prison in such a built up area
4355760 we dont see why one should be built here especially when there are other areas like wrexham that actually want the prison
4355761 were not opposed to a prison were opposed to the place where they want to place it
4355762 i just think that you cant put a prison in a populated residential area with schools in the 21st century
4355763 it might have been all right in victorian times but not today
4355764 but its not just that its going to effect the economic prosperity of the area as having prison nearby is going to bring house prices right down
4355765 theres upwards of 4 000 homes in the area around the site thats not people thats just houses so its going to effect a lot of peoples lives
4355766 i can understand the money side of it because all the roads and other facilities are already in place here while the other places dont have them
4355767 but what i dont understand is that although wrexham hasnt got these things they actually want the prison so why not give it to them we just dont want it
4355768 help help we cannot collaborate with notes teamrooms surely your wiki will save us
4355769 why yes it will solve all your problems and all will be right with the world
4355770 why does no one pay attention to me why cannot i get any traction with the business
4355771 you are doing this all wrong you are idiots with your impenetrable chains of emails and your hidden information nests
4355772 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4355773 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4355774 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4355775 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4355776 if you bore me then im comfortable if you interest me im scared
4355777 can we continue to tolerate technophobes in a technologically savvy 21st century

4355788 i set sail when i think of charlotte on a sea of memories of nights when neither sleep nor certainty reigned the veiled face of a slender lady disillusioned acquainted with deceit delicate crosses the threshold of this book which will sadly speak about pleasure
4355789 in this word inexorable i bring together the array of forces to which we know only to give the name
4355790 senses uncompromising lords ignorant like the princes of bygone times who learned only that which was necessary to conceal to hate to order it is you however that charlotte asleep for a peaceful night subdued by opium used to keep in check assigning arbitrary limits to your empire but who then charlotte can fix your unstable boundaries
4355791 in the face of alcohol of donjuanism 2 of homosexuality it is not a book which decides between good and evil nor even between right and wrong we meet in it a misogynous don juan it is a piece of music which maintains our awareness of evil to avoid that it our awareness should fall asleep on the judgments of a kangaroo court

4355805 the great harvard marketing professor theodore levitt used to tell his students people dont want to buy a quarter inch drill they want a quarter inch hole every marketer we know agrees with levitts insight yet these same people segment their markets by type of drill and by price point they measure market share of drills not holes and they benchmark the features and functions of their drill not their hole against those of rivals they then set to work offering more features and functions in the belief that these will translate into better pricing and market share when marketers do this they often solve the wrong problems improving their products in ways that are irrelevant to their customers needs segmenting markets by type of customer is no better thus the prevailing methods of segmentation that budding managers learn in business schools and then practice in the marketing departments of good companies are actually a key reason that new product innovation has become a gamble in which the odds of winning are horrifyingly low
4355806 thirty thousand new consumer products are launched each year but over 90 of them fail and thats after marketing professionals have spent massive amounts of money trying to understand what their customers want
4355807 and there havent been any changes in short my policy wasnt different than former democratic governor jim florio he passed the laws and enforced them well
4355808 i was mayor we worked very aggressively to get illegal guns off the street and we were successful and violent crime and murder plummeted
4355809 if mr schundler thinks hes ok with doing what other administrations have done in the past i disagree entirely its up to me as a local mayor to do something about the carnage thats been wrought in this country by guns
4355810 we cannot end these traditions just because there is no king
4355811 the fact that nepal is now a republic is not an excuse to drop centuries old traditions
4355812 the kumari and other festivals the king was involved in were to acknowledge the person who holds the power to protect the nation
4355813 cultural hegemony has shifted from the king to the people
4355814 its natural that these religious ceremonies are carried out by the president or prime minister
4355815 for centuries nepal has remained socially harmonious despite being a multi ethnic multi lingual and multi faith country
4355816 it was the king who was a central point of unity
4355817 holding these festivals without the king renders them totally meaningless
4355818 well respect the aspirations of the nepali people for peace
4355819 and well work for the preparation of a new constitution and for the forward looking transformation of the society
4355820 well try to bring other political parties on board as well
4355821 companies get skills focused instead of customer needs focused the world changes and what used to be cutting edge skills have turned into something your customers may not need anymore a much more stable strategy is to start with what do my customers need then do an inventory of the gaps in your skills

4355826 am happy for you uganda and want to say that production revenues should go towards alleviating poverty and creating more jobs the key to any natural resource making a difference in the lives of people is making wise use of the revenues that accrue from that resource
4355827 we are actively planning aggressive further exploration to follow up these discoveries which have opened up a new potential african oil province
4355828 the flow rates even constrained by available completion and test facilities far exceeded our expectations
4355829 following interpretation of the data from these two tests a decision was taken not to proceed with further testing
4355830 the tests represented a secondary exploration objective for the well which will now be sidetracked and drilling will continue to the deeper primary objectives
4355831 we are delighted with the test results from an upper zone which is not the primary target of the well
4355832 this discovery proves there is a working hydrocarbon system in block 3a significantly reducing the exploration risk of the other high impact prospects that have been identified throughout our licenses in the albert basin we look forward to accelerating the work programmes in the basin

4355836 government because of financial arrangements got a willing partner who wanted to support development in different sectors and one of the sectors was ict because we felt it was an operation priority we made a decision and asked china to assist
4355837 it is a book that has fascinated me and i recommend it
4355838 the media and democracy should be good bed fellows they should be in a position to rely on one another but its unfortunate that often constraints of a political and economic nature stand in the way of their bed fellowship
4355839 during what has come to be called the continents second liberation struggle in the 1990s
4355840 many journalists and the publications they work for have often been so politicised and disrespectful of the need to base reports on facts and the collection of evidence that their role in promoting democratisation has been very limited
4355841 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4355842 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the 298 votes needed for a simple majority
4355843 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated

4355846 saya tidak tahu anda perlu bertanya kepada pihak yang mengendali kes ini untuk mendapat sebab dan jawapan yang tepat
4355847 saya hanya menteri dalam negeri dan saya tidak terlibat dalam proses pendakwaan dan penyiasatan
4355848 jika kita mahu mengambil tindakan kita perlu melakukan siasatan bukan sewenang wenangnya bertindak perlu meneliti dari segenap aspek
4355849 jika tiada perkara seumpama itu berlaku kita hanya boleh memberi amaran agar mereka mengambil kira pandangan dan sensitiviti agama serta kaum lain
4355850 kita tidak mahu dalam apa juga konflik atau permasalahan islam dianggap sebagai punca sedangkan ia adalah masalah sejagat yang perlu diberi perhatian sama rata oleh semua pihak
4355851 saya fikir kalau kita bincang baik baik tak ada masalah jangan fokus kepada isu tertentu
4355852 jika mereka keluar daripada skop yang ditetapkan maka kami harus menyiasat sama ada mereka telah melanggar undang undang atau tidak
4355853 ini adalah kerana al quran dan sunnah yang menjadi panduan tertinggi telah mengajar kita supaya bersifat terbuka mencari kebaikan dan menolak fasad
4355854 maka pas menerima segala undangan dari mana mana parti politik dan ngo dari dalam dan luar negara
4355855 kepimpinan parti pula akan mendengar apa yang hendak dinyatakan dalam semua bentuk pertemuan itu sebelum membuat apa apa pertimbangan
4355856 manakala keputusan pula tidak boleh dibuat sewenang wenangnya tetapi hendaklah dirujuk kepada parti di semua peringkat
4355857 jangan kita sekali kali leka seolah olah peranan kita hanya untuk musim pilihanraya semata mata dan tidak ada lagi peranan selepas menang dalam pilihanraya

4355888 our strong catholic faith teaches us the importance of treating all of gods children with love and respect it also teaches us that marriage between a man and a woman is the foundation of the family the first school of love peace and justice
4355889 the ruling by the california supreme court nullifying the definition of marriage in state law was a shock to catholics and other citizens who are concerned about how this will affect their own childrens understanding of marriage for their future

4355907 the eib and the european commission sign mou on coordination of external lending policy
4355908 a plain de regulation agenda in favour of european business with little regard to fundamental issues such as sustainable development poverty eradication or economic sovereignty
4355909 it says for example that future directives on social labour or environmental issues for instance should not be threatening the global competitiveness of european corporations
4355910 global europe poses a serious threat to social justice gender equality and sustainable development not only outside the eu but also within the erosion of workers rights the worsening of the quality of jobs within the eu the destruction of a sustainable model of farming is also intrinsically linked to the external eu trade agenda with trade liberalisation across all sectors agriculture industry and services the beneficiaries are a handful of corporations but millions lose their jobs

4355914 i spend a lot of time in here staring at these candles
4355915 just thinking little flames swirling in the air it comforts me colors and privation of colors all the answers ill ever need one of the things i often think of while sitting here is the queer relationship between time and light
4355916 we were taught as children that the human brain receives visual information as the cornea intercepts it from the light spectrum as if the light wasnt there before as if it needed the human brains sanction to exist at all we were also taught that the mind assimilates this visual data into assorted modes of scientific and psychological assertion cause and effect theory association illusion the mind thrusts upon itself certain varieties of light as times witness as specific and inalienable proofs of time our vision more than any of our other senses acts as a placeholder for all the things we experience in this world it is the supreme catalog of the human condition of course light is synonymous with many things in the human lexicon but the most pervasive of associations is light with the pairing of our concept of time for those of us who are not blind and i imagine even for some of us who are the visible world is permanently wed to history we cannot think of the past without trying to see it trying to visualize it we cant possibly comprehend a future without looking for it trying to see what our world will look like but light is not time my friend nor does it exist in time light creates its own time it carries its own dimensions all of which far exceed and outperform our frail human understanding time is a human machination a device of logic and pragmatic substance but light is meta human it operates as an instrument of the gods as a divine right of privilege the sole witness of soul transit and multi dimensional communion in this an omnisensory universe of mere human speculation
4355917 looks like records theres a dimple in the carpet where a box maybe a pile of boxes used to be

4355934 if i knew the difference i would have made the adjustment right away
4355935 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year where he was really dominating
4355936 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding the main thing was he could throw it for strikes early in the count
4355937 kuroda was mixing it up throwing sliders and curveballs mixed his fastball in and changed speeds on his fastball trying to keep hitters off balance
4355938 its tough man weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before

4355945 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4355946 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4355947 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4355948 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4355959 were probably more physical we like the challenge as a group
4355960 especially with the secondary we have we want to make them pass the ball

4355964 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person

4356244 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india
4356245 you send him in a time machine and transport him to the old west there are gold rushes there are gunfights its awesome i have the whole thing already worked out
4356246 forget the effing leprechaun this penis robot is the worst thing ever
4356247 sahabatku semua seperti tradisi kita selama ini kita selalu hidup bersama dan saling membantu menuju kemakmuran dan kesejahteraan bersama saat ini musim hujan sudah mulai datang sangat bagus bagi kita untuk bercocok tanam saya ingin mengetahui pendapat saudara saudara sekalian tanaman apa yang paling cepat menghasilkan dan rasanya enak yang patut kita tanam
4356248 hi kambing kami tidak suka dengan daun kacang kami lebih suka dengan buahnya bagaimana kalo kami keluarga samong akan makan buahnya kalian keluarga kambing makan daunnya
4356249 samong kita kan sudah sepakat kalo daunnya untuk kami buahnya untuk kalian jadi kami memakan yang menjadi bagian kami kenapa kamu marah ini kan termasuk dalam perjanjian dan dalam rapat kita tempo hari tidak ada membicarakan tentang kapan kami berhak untuk menikmatinya demikian juga kapan kalian berhak menikmatinya
4356250 bunda kalo nanti samong marah dan menyerang kita apa yang harus kita lakukan samong tenaganya besar mereka bisa mengalahkan binatang binatang besar sementara kita hanya binatang lemah bagaimana menghadapinya
4356251 hai anak anakku semua kita memang binatang yang lebih lemah dari sang samong tapi kita tidak boleh kalah dari mereka
4356252 sialan sang kambing dia mempermainkan kita dia tidak menghargai kita tidak bisa melihat kekuatan kita anak anakku semua besok pagi kita serang sang kambing kita cabik cabik dagingnya dengan taring dan cakar cakar kita
4356253 hi kambing kamu ternyata sahabat yang jahat kamu telah menipu kami sekarang terimalah balasan dari kami siapkan dirimu sebentar lagi kalian menjadi santapan siang kami
4356254 hi samong kamu kira kami gentar menghadapi kamu kami tidak pernah menipu kalian kami hanya makan apa yang menjadi bagian dari kami sambil menatap tajam ke arah sang samong kambing berkata lantang samong tahan langkahmu sebentar lihatlah pada anak anakku serentak anak anak kambing menyeringai memperlihatkan gigi dan lidahnya yang merah barusan kami telah memakan sepuluh ekor samong perhatikan lidah dan gigi anak anakku penuh bersimbah darah dari temen temen kalian
4356255 tidak mungkin kalian hanya binatang lemah pemakan tumbuhan mana mungkin bisa mengalahkan samong
4356256 kamu tidak percaya kami memang kecil tapi bukan berarti kami bisa kalian kalahkan dengan mudah kalo kamu tidak percaya lihatlah ke dalam sumur banyak sekali kepala temen temen kamu di sana tubuh tubuh mereka telah kami santap sebagai sarapan pagi apakah kalian mau menyusul kebetulan kami belum punya makan siang
4356257 setengah tidak percaya samong diikuti keluarganya melangkah mendekati sumur dengan sangat hati hati mereka mendengokkan kepalanya tampaklah wajah wajah mereka di dalam sumur seketika itu pula nyali sang samong jadi ciut tanpa tunggu lagi mereka segera kabur ketakutan bayangan kepala mereka di dalam sumur dikira kepala dari temen temen mereka yang disantap oleh sang kambing
4356258 deber verse si no hubo corresponsabilidad del estado por alg n incumplimiento en la concesi n pero si no es as entonces la responsabilidad de la deuda es de marsans
4356259 la visita a jun n tiene car cter institucional no est previsto que se aborden cuestiones de pol tica partidaria
4356260 cobos puede firmar decretos de toda ndole y reglamentar leyes
4356261 si los ingresos no logran seguirle el ritmo al gasto el gobierno tiene poco margen pol tico para mantener super vit presupuestarios recortando los gastos
4356262 es m s seguro que no vaya a estar a que est
4356263 debo reconocer que en uno de los anexos no en el decreto que se trabaja estaba prevista la huella yo nunca la descart pero tampoco lo afirme
4356264 encontrar con las empresas la posibilidad para garantizar que si un tel fono se rob o se perdi se muera
4356265 unos cuantos millones m s pero es lo que corresponde
4356266 no voy a ser candidato a diputado nacional ni a legislador provincial
4356267 para nada el dice que debo participar en pol tica pero yo quiero trabajar desde el gremialismo
4356268 de reuniones con todos los partidos pol ticos porque en mi opini n debemos hablar con todos los dirigentes
4356269 la lecher a atraviesa por un momento por dem s dif cil teniendo en cuenta que los productores cobran precios que est n por debajo de los costos de producci n si a esto se suma el cierre de la exportaci n de quesos ser a terrible
4356270 se est empezando a oler una situaci n de crisis que genera mayor enfriamiento
4356271 hubo una tregua en ese punto pero las econom as no se recuperaron del todo todav a estamos saliendo y no hay medidas claras
4356272 en rivadavia hab a crecido mucho el empleo por la construcci n y tambi n hab a proyectos de valor agregado que ocupaban mucha mano de obra como es un proyecto sobre el ma z y una empresa metal rgica para el campo
4356273 no podemos esperar m s si no hay soluciones firmes a los problemas de las econom as regionales creo que el interior va a explotar
4356274 la actividad est mejorando aunque nunca nos vimos tan perjudicados por las retenciones a los granos porque lo nuestro siempre fue la leche
4356275 la alta volatilidad de la obra p blica hace que a menudo sea la principal variable de ajuste de la que se echa mano cuando se debe achicar el gasto
4356276 aunque la construcci n creci en el primer semestre un 6 6 en los meses de mayo y junio disminuy considerablemente respecto del mismo per odo del a o pasado
4356277 al que est bamos acostumbrados va a ser muy dif cil
4356278 que se recree el clima de confianza y la gente se anime a volver a invertir
4356279 ser muy lentamente y siempre y cuando no se d un nuevo cimbronazo
4356280 la inflaci n nos complica mucho como en todo el pa s los bienes y servicios aumentaron mucho por eso este mes se decidi incrementar las tasas municipales en un 16 a trav s de la incorporaci n de una nueva cuota
4356281 aunque al principio hubo un cambio de humor y esperanza en la gente hoy el clima es otra vez de preocupaci n porque no ven que la situaci n mejore
4356282 afect mucho a toda esta zona b sicamente lechera y repercuti negativamente en varias microempresas
4356283 la econom a del interior se rige casi exclusivamente por la producci n agropecuaria y en ese sentido la gente del campo ha dejado de invertir de hacer arreglos y eso se nota en la situaci n global
4356284 en estos ltimos meses registramos una ca da sostenida de la recaudaci n en concepto de tasas municipales y ahora estamos haciendo un seguimiento para evaluar el proceso y pensar soluciones
4356285 hoy no hay estado de movilizaci n s se siente la inconformidad del pueblo y espec ficamente del sector agropecuario
4356286 la ca da del precio de los granos el aumento de los combustibles y la interrupci n de las exportaciones de quesos hace que los productores sufran una p rdida de expectativas y no logren visualizar un horizonte claro
4356287 ha mostrado una recuperaci n respecto de los meses de conflicto a n no ha logrado volver a los ndices de crecimiento que registraba antes
4356288 tenemos obras de infraestructura que se paralizaron por falta de recursos
4356289 por el alto incremento que sufrieron los agroqu micos y fertilizantes respecto de 2007 la entrada al puerto de estos productos tambi n disminuy notablemente
4356290 estas vacaciones la ocupaci n hotelera fue del 30 cuando en general se ocupa un promedio de m s del 50
4356291 esto responde m s a la inseguridad de la gente por el problema de la inflaci n que al conflicto del campo
4356292 a principio de a o acordamos un aumento del 18 pero con el incremento de los precios en bienes y servicios comenzaron a exigir un nuevo aumento de salarios que el municipio hoy no est en condiciones de afrontar dependemos casi exclusivamente de lo que ingrese por la reforma impositiva
4356293 en el circuito balneario del distrito por ejemplo ya registramos una merma de 30 o 40
4356294 car shoppers who panicked in june and july about gas prices are losing intrest in small cars and hybrids as fuel prices have declined
4356295 in june 31 4 of recent new car buyers surveyed said the purchase was motivated by a desire for better gas mileage acxiom says that is up from 21 1 in february but still less than a third of buyers there is not this huge flood to one segmennt in the auto industry
4356296 i have a new partner this time we are in good shape were here to win
4356297 i felt a little sluggish but my body woke up now
4356298 la past que dans ton bec mais pas le steak
4356299 ik ben op mijn veertigste van baan veranderd dat heeft mijn horizon verruimd jobmobiliteit is heel belangrijk voor de arbeidsvreugde daar ben ik rotsvast van overtuigd ik ben ook bij randstad komen werken omdat ik geloof in de meerwaarde van uitzendarbeid uitzendarbeid zorgt ervoor dat de arbeidsmarkt in beweging blijft wij houden de aderverkalking van de belgische arbeidsmarkt tegen
4356300 een derde van onze uitzendkrachten uit brussel gaat in vlaanderen werken
4356301 het gaat vooral om eentalige laaggeschoolden die in brussel niet aan de bak komen dat bewijst dat wij een meerwaarde kunnen bieden de overheid spreekt erover wij doen het nu al en dat zonder enige ruggensteun van de overheid
4356302 er zijn drie drempels er is het taalprobleem bij brusselse werklozen sommige werkzoekenden spreken zelfs niet een van de twee landstalen ze zijn ten tweede vaak laaggeschoold waardoor het beschikbaar aantal banen kleiner is tot slot is er ook de mobiliteit ze moeten ook ter plaatse geraken
4356303 maar er s wel werk voor laaggeschoolden bandwerk bijvoorbeeld is in heel vlaanderen een knelpuntberoep als laaggeschoolde werklozen de juiste attitude hebben op tijd komen en wat sociale vaardigheden hebben is er wel werk
4356304 brussel doet het slecht maar de brusselse economie boert goed ze cre ert heel wat welvaart het grote probleem is dat weinig brusselaars daarvan kunnen profiteren typisch voor grote steden is dat ze nogal wat mensen aantrekken die puur in economische termen gesteld meer kosten aan de maatschappij dan dat ze voor welvaart zorgen voor brussel komt daar nog de taalgrens bij die de mobiliteit afremt daarnaast kun je niet ontkennen dat er beleidsmatig blunders zijn begaan dat er te traag is gerea geerd het hoofdstedelijk gewest is veel te laat in gang geschoten om de werkloosheidsproblemen aan te pakken
4356305 we moeten ons durven af te vragen of de huidige brusselse instellingen de meest geschikte zijn om de torenhoge werkloosheid aan te pakken is actiris de vroegere bgda svg dv wel gewapend om die massale werkloosheid te lijf te gaan ik ben me die vraag gaan stellen bij het lezen van een interview met eddy courth oux actiris baas van ps signatuur svg dv die in de morgen zei dat actiris niet de centen heeft voor individuele begeleiding van werkzoekenden het heeft dus niet alleen met competentie te maken maar ook met schaalgrootte
4356306 daarom zeg ik en ik heb dat ook al in columns geschreven maar die mening bindt alleen mezelf hevel de arbeidsbemiddeling over van de gewesten naar de gemeenschappen en laat vdab en forem de zaak in brussel eens bestieren dat zijn grote instellingen die het klappen van de zweep kennen en die een gericht beleid kunnen voeren naar de brusselse werklozen laat ze desnoods met goede afspraken ook maar met elkaar in concurrentie treden dat kan geen kwaad
4356307 dat debat is voorbij een paar decennia geleden was arbeidsbemiddeling zowat volledig in handen van de staat en was de uitzendsector quantit n gligeable sinds de internationale arbeidsorganisatie ilo in gen ve eind jaren 1990 bepaald heeft dat een gemengd model het beste is met verschillende aanbieders zowel publiek als priv is hier ook in belgi min of meer een consensus over beide vullen elkaar aan maar moeten ook samenwerken en dat model loopt goed
4356308 de samenwerking lukt het best in vlaanderen maar dat is pas sinds fons leroy aan het hoofd van de vdab staat walloni is sterk verbeterd in brussel is er vooruitgang maar hier staan we op het vlak van samenwerking tussen priv en publieke arbeidsbemiddeling het minst ver in vlaanderen is er intussen een basisvertrouwen tussen overheid en randstad een vertrouwen dat we in brussel nog niet kennen sterke priv partners en een sterke publieke dienst zijn allebei nodig voor de ontwikkeling van de arbeidsmarkt want de uitdagingen zullen groot blijven
4356309 ik wil daarbij twee opmerkingen vooraf maken een prognose over 25 jaar is eigenlijk te ver af tien jaar is doenbaar twee de toekomst van de brusselse arbeidsmarkt zal in hoge mate worden bepaald door de rol die brussel zal spelen in het toekomstige belgi is brussel nog hoofdstad van belgi van vlaanderen en zo nee kan brussel nog zijn europese rol blijven spelen als die meervoudige hoofdstedelijke functie op de helling komt te staan dan is het zeer de vraag of brussel zijn welvaart zal kunnen behouden
4356310 dat is het negatieve scenario ik wil echter uitgaan van een positief scenario brussel is over 25 jaar denk ik een bruisende metropool met zeer veel hooggeschoolde arbeid met nog meer internationalisering en met grote bedrijven die er een hub een zetel hebben het zal een kosmopolitische stad zijn zoals we die voor de wereldoorlogen hebben gekend in oost europa het waren steden waar zeven acht talen werden gesproken in thessaloniki spraken de schoenpoetsers aan het begin van vorige eeuw zeven talen wel die meertaligheid d t is een mooi toekomstbeeld voor brussel
4356311 vanuit die migrantenpopulatie zullen er meer brusselaars doorstromen naar hogere studies en zullen ze ook beter betaalde banen hebben daarnaast zullen er nog altijd veel laaggeschoolde allochtonen blijven waarom omdat er een instroom van laaggeschoolde migranten blijft door de gezinshereniging maar de migranten zullen uit nog meer landen komen en zullen in alle sociale lagen te vinden zijn
4356312 ik heb niets tegen hamburgerbanen ze zijn niet minderwaardig als je meer hooggeschoolden hebt dan komt er ook meer werk voor laaggeschoolden vanwege de dienstverlening drie hooggeschoolden cre ren een baan voor n laaggeschoolde
4356313 ik denk van niet onze welvaartsstaat zal als principe overeind blijven daar ben ik rotsvast van overtuigd we worden geen mini amerika al dertig jaar hoor ik roepen dat de sociale afbraak bezig is maar vandaag zijn de belgische werknemers sociaal nog altijd heel goed beschermd zo heeft meer dan negentig procent van de werknemers een contract van onbepaalde duur
4356314 betekent dat dan dat er niets moet veranderen nee belgi kent bijvoorbeeld nog altijd het onderscheid tussen arbeiders en bedienden een harmonisering van de statuten is nodig europa dringt daarop aan dat zal mogelijk ten koste gaan van wat sociale bescherming bijvoorbeeld in de opzegtermijnen voor bedienden ik denk dat dat een goede zaak is werknemers kunnen ook t goed beschermd zijn zodat ze in een kooitje komen te zitten maar ben je daar gelukkig ik denk van niet als dat vogeltje dan twintig jaar in dat kooitje zit en men zet het kooitje open dan zal het niet meer willen wegvliegen
4356315 ik noem dat geen sociale bescherming werkloosheidssteun is een fuik geworden we hebben daarmee onze schuld afgekocht het was een goede reden om ons niet meer met de werklozen bezig te houden want ze krijgen toch elke maand een zak met geld de activeringspolitiek is iets van de laatste jaren men helpt iemand het best door hem of haar te leren voor zichzelf te zorgen maar voor wie echt niet meekan moet er natuurlijk wel een sociaal vangnet zijn
4356316 ik heb het wel voor de vs ondanks vreselijke zaken als de doodstraf die in sommige staten nog bestaat een land dat toonaangevend is is toonaangevend in alles ik ben er niet zeker van dat men over 25 jaar niet met weemoed zal terugdenken aan de hegemonie van de vs in onze wereld ik weet niet of het met de chinezen zoveel beter zal zijn dat verwijt ik links een beetje dat ze nooit een antwoord hebben geformuleerd op de val van de berlijnse muur het failliet van het communisme er is geen groot links maatschappelijk project
4356317 dat moet elke hogelooneconomie moet zorgen voor grote meerwaardes we spreken dan over hightech biotechnologie de hele brede medische sector medisch toerisme tot en met wellness we zijn daar sterk in laten we daar geld mee verdienen de zware industrie staat onder druk ik weet bijvoorbeeld niet of audi brussels over 25 jaar nog in vorst zal zitten
4356318 anderzijds zie ik ook een kleine terugval in de delocalisering wegtrekken van bedrijven naar lageloonlanden svg dv om ecologische en economische redenen transport kost meer zal men daarvan terugkomen dat zien we nu al in de vs lokale productie komt terug brussel zal daar wel minder van kunnen profiteren dan vlaanderen en walloni
4356319 de troeven voor brussel liggen in het kosmopolitische en het culturele het is moeilijk om managers in kortrijk te krijgen omdat die stad weinig culturele uitstraling heeft ik heb onlangs met carlos brito gesproken braziliaanse inbev directeur svg dv ik vroeg hem wat hem opviel in brussel hij zei de veiligheid in brazili wordt hij bewaakt zo zie je maar hoe percepties kunnen verschillen brussel is een relatief veilige stad maar zal hoedanook moeten inzetten op levenskwaliteit
4356320 je hebt de vlaming altijd al alleen in brussel gekregen als er geld te verdienen viel de middenstanders bakkers en beenhouwers uit west vlaanderen bijvoorbeeld in de toekomst zullen hooggeschoolden om diezelfde redenen voor de stad kiezen toch zal op korte termijn het pendelverkeer naar brussel afnemen omdat vlamingen in eigen streek werk zoeken omdat ze de files beu zijn dat wil meteen ook zeggen dat als die stroom uit vlaanderen vermindert er een probleem zal ontstaan om de brusselse vacatures ingevuld te krijgen maar als brussel een internationale kosmopolitische toplocatie kan worden zoals ik het geschetst heb dan zullen de vlamingen wel in brussel komen wonen
4356321 het is de enige stad in belgi met een internationale roeping antwerpen heeft buiten de haven niet veel te bieden
4356322 dat brussel nu een welvarende economie heeft komt niet door het beleid maar eerder ondanks het beleid zonder dat ik een steen wil werpen naar bepaalde mensen want zoals eerder gezegd heeft het ook te maken met schaalgrootte je zou brussel kunnen uitbreiden waar socio economisch wel iets voor te zeggen valt maar wat politiek dan weer moeilijk ligt brussel heeft in ieder geval nu communautaire rust nodig het zal dus goed zijn als de politieke discussies voorbij zijn
4356323 we zijn daar heel duidelijk in we doen daar niet aan mee over de grond van de zaak hoeven we niet eens te discussi ren discriminatie op de arbeidsmarkt is dom laakbaar en onrechtvaardig maar er is ook iets anders het debat is danig verziekt we zijn in een zwart witsitua tie terechtgekomen sommige verenigingen maken er een sport van om gevallen van al dan niet vermeend racisme in de media te brengen terwijl er ook een grijze zone is selectie en aanwerving zijn ook een individueel gebeuren er moet chemistry zijn tussen werkgever en sollicitant een bedrijf met veertig procent marokkanen dat vraagt om voorlopig geen marokkanen meer te sturen daar kunnen we begrip voor opbrengen een bedrijf met veertig procent allochtonen is niet racistisch of wat doen met migranten die geen orders willen aannemen van vrouwelijke chefs maar we zijn er zo op gebrand om mensen te pakken die iets verkeerds hebben gezegd ik denk trouwens dat de discriminatie ten aanzien van oudere werknemers groter is dan etnische discriminatie alleen horen we daar minder over in de pers
4356324 een zeer lekkere vissoort die gewoonlijk in repen bereid wordt en zeer gemakkelijk de tong vervangt
4356325 queremos volver a disfrutar de cada uno de los pasos que dimos
4356326 tocar ah nos daba muchos nervios y ahora nos da un poco de nostalgia por eso queremos rescatar cosas que no pudimos disfrutar demasiado con la velocidad de los ltimos a os
4356327 volver a obras era nuestro fetiche es un mimo personal
4356328 in samenspraak met specialisten kunnen mensen voor een deftige prijs in dit sportcentrum iets doen aan hun gezondheid ik denk dat er geen andere ziekenfondsen zijn die zoiets organiseren een fitnessclub beheerd door een ziekenfonds bestaat al wel maar wij zijn de eersten die een wellness sportcentrum oprichten
4356329 hetzelfde geldt voor mensen met hartklachten dia betes en anorexia zorgen ook voor problemen genezen kan niet het onder controle houden wel sport helpt daarbij net als di ten daarom zullen we ook een diet lunch aanbieden van een chef die een speciaal menu samenstelt
4356330 we willen een familiesfeer een echte club uitbouwen daarnaast zijn we apolitiek en pluralistisch iedereen is welkom bovendien gebeurt alles in drie talen in een echt brusselse sfeer
4356331 onder de vroegere beheerder is de squashclub tenondergegaan dat was niet gepland ook moest de vorige eigenaar met de brusselse gasintercommunale ibg kijken of er geen benzine meer in de grond zat vroeger was er hier een garage om een vergunning te kunnen krijgen dat heeft een jaar geduurd de overige werkzaamheden nog eens een jaar intussen is alles vernieuwd alleen vier squashzalen zijn behouden
4356332 hun team is zeker zes keer belgisch squashkampioen geweest we hebben zelfs een ploeg gehad die de tweede plaats haalde op een europees kampioenschap dat was nog met sterspeler stefan casteleyn
4356333 vroeger werden hier de belangrijkste squash toernooien gespeeld toen hadden we nog acht zalen de club trok ook bekende mensen aan zoals p r zetterberg en franky vercauteren
4356334 we gaan voor een groter en diverser publiek daarom beginnen we onder andere met een squashclub voor kinderen en veteranen scholen zullen we ook aanspreken het moet een plek worden voor jong en oud we streven naar een plaats waar een echte clubgeest heerst en waar de mensen geen nummer zijn
4356335 in een tweede fase komen er orthopedisten en kinesitherapeuten naar hier om aan eventuele problemen te sleutelen zij zullen zien of mensen bepaalde sporten wel mogen beoefenen dat zal in een rugschool gebeuren in het huis hiernaast binnen een jaar is die klaar dan kun je oefenen en raad krijgen op dit ogenblik bekijk ik of er hier een dokter aanwezig kan zijn terwijl er mensen sporten
4356336 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4356337 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4356338 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4356339 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4356340 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4356341 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4356342 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4356343 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4356344 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4356345 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4356346 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4356347 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4356348 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4356349 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4356350 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4356351 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4356352 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4356353 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4356354 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4356355 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4356356 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4356357 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4356358 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4356359 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4356360 there is no doubt that the industry is under considerable pressure because of the high australian dollar the cost of fuel cleaner emission requirements and intense worldwide competition despite these challenges the industry is transforming itself and my recommendations aim to assist that transformation out to 2020
4356361 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4356362 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4356363 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4356364 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4356365 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4356366 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4356367 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4356368 who are open to doing something on the production side
4356369 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4356370 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4356371 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4356372 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4356373 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4356374 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4356375 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4356376 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4356377 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4356378 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4356379 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4356380 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4356381 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4356382 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4356383 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4356384 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4356385 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4356386 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4356387 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4356388 money was tight for charlie manson in the early days
4356389 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4356390 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4356391 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4356392 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4356393 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4356394 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4356395 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4356396 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4356397 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4356398 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4356399 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4356400 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4356401 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4356402 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4356403 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4356404 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4356405 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4356406 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4356407 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4356408 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4356409 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4356410 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4356411 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4356412 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4356413 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4356414 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4356415 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4356416 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4356417 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4356418 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4356419 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4356420 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4356421 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4356422 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4356423 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4356424 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4356425 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4356426 cumplir el mandato de nuestros pueblos de concretar las autonom as departamentales aplicando los estatutos auton micos aprobados
4356427 that is a factor that cannot be overlooked by the government
4356428 what we have to ensure that tariff reduction occurs in a way which will be matched by achievements in terms of improved export prospects in other markets and the collapse of those wto negotiations has an impact on that objective
4356429 i think that they didnt take into account the fact that the doha round collapsed they havent taken into account the fact that the european union have maintained their tariffs at 10 per cent
4356430 that said however well weigh up the report in its totality and the benefit that it delivers to the industry
4356431 ive long argued that all of the subsidies going to the australian vehicle manufacturers should be tied to vehicle fuel efficiency to recognise that consumers want smaller more fuel efficient cars because the price of fuel is being driven by overall oil prices and that may continue to go up
4356432 the rudd governments overriding imperative should be to make every single vehicle on australias roads more efficient than they are
4356433 the australian automotive industry should stand or fall on its own two feet through its own efforts and they shouldnt be cowering behind a tariff protection wall and they shouldnt be waiting for governments to invest 2 billion of the taxpayers money in them
4356434 the government will respond to those ideas in due course
4356435 this is a high quality report that deserves thoughtful consideration and a quality response
4356436 our aim will be to achieve the best possible social and economic outcomes not just for today or tomorrow but for the long term
4356437 the government cannot pretend this is steve bracks report and not theirs the fact is they hand picked mr bracks to write the report they wanted
4356438 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven
4356439 the advantages of tubeless tires for cross are almost too good to be true
4356440 i run them at less than 25 pounds and they give me ultimate traction no pinch flats and faster rolling wheels than any tubed tire ive ever tried
4356441 we are pumped to introduce our new more aggressive bulldog cyclocross tire to the industry through this promotion with shimano their duraace wheels are designed to work with our tires and the results so far have been amazing
4356442 he was a regular healthy cyclist just like the rest of us
4356443 we had a routine sales meeting chris gets out of the meeting and sits down at his cubicle he starts breathing funny our sales office is pretty small and someone heard him and started giving him a hard time we all like to joke and keep it lighthearted around here then someone went around the corner and he was having what appeared to be an epileptic seizure
4356444 since hes fairly new to the company we didnt know any history of whether hes diabetic or epileptic
4356445 their quick reaction really saved his life it seemed like it took forever for authorities to get here it was three to five minutes but it seemed like half an hour
4356446 if they hadnt administered cpr he probably wouldnt be here and healthy
4356447 consumers have greater concern for the environment and a desire for better physical fitness
4356448 combine that with the increase in the price of gasoline and you have this perfect storm
4356449 giant will continue its successful strategy as a retail support organization as opposed to simply a sales company
4356450 in giants long term plan to be the best partner it can be to bicycle retailers the company has a focus on three ps people programs and products
4356451 with a buzz about selling giant bikes more so than ever before i feel very confident about the company products and our future together
4356452 i was also very pleased to see and meet so many people from giant
4356453 all the people appear to be top notch way into the bike thing and totally approachable which is very refreshing it makes me want to do more business with a company when a general manager or the worldwide president of a corporation the size of giant introduces themselves to me and wants to know what im thinking i especially enjoyed listening to tony lo speak about the past present and future vision of the bicycling industry
4356454 in case you are wondering what the best selling pc game in north america was for the third week of july 2008 according to the retail sales figures compiled by npd well it wasnt devil may cry 4 which received a score of 8 awesome from games radar nor was it mass effect which received a score of 9 awesome from games radar nope it was little ol nancy drew the phantom of venice now isnt that a crock of seven out of ten
4356455 i wish this game was on reflexive itd be easy to get then
4356456 we must speed up the process of harmonizing african mining policy framework as it would allow africa to arrive at its comparative advantage which would eventually lead to competitive advantage with or beneficiation intervention
4356457 it is evident that the value addition of our respective commodities presents opportunities for demand and markets particularly for artisinal and small scale mining on the continent
4356458 other projects of amp that seem non core such as the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach should not be left unattended as already prescribed by the european commissions legislation
4356459 since the formal launch of amp in 2004 we have never had any opportune time than now to get affiliated to the african union au
4356460 we need combination strategies for african countries to synergize their energies for the creation of energy pools for the development of the mineral industry
4356461 the end justifies the means syndrome by some politicians which they use to discredit their political opponents must be discouraged

4356465 when we add barfly to the mix we create one of the largest most robust new media networks around the opportunities to target audiences and provide a new fresh mix of content are unlimited
4356466 joining touchtunes will help us leverage our combined creativity and capabilities to quickly expand with target audiences and in key growth markets
4356467 the acquisition brings great value to both companies touchtunes and barfly are mutually interested in helping brands to interact with consumers inside of bars in unique and fun ways that deliver real business results
4356468 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4356469 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4356470 since crc took over responsibility for our it we have gained a level of confidence in our infrastructure from the optimum performance of our individual workstations to our servers

4356476 i entered politics so paraguay can stop being known to the world as the country of drug trafficking corruption and illegality
4356477 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4356478 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4356479 the optimistic scenario is he wont accomplish much but he will be well regarded and respected by the people as a president who is not corrupt and does not take bribes
4356480 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4356481 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4356482 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4356483 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4356484 i have heard threats that we are not going to be admitted to the world trade organization but we see clearly that nobody is going to admit us there anyway
4356485 we regret that the u s still refuses to admit the real cause for what happened which is that georgian president mikhail saakashvilis regime in violation of all its international obligations unleashed a war against the people of south ossetia
4356486 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4356487 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4356488 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4356489 its the legal framework in which we can all participate each assuming his responsibility

4356495 so many swimmers have swum so well here so the pressure was gone
4356496 the relay was behind me so i just eased into it without feeling too much pressure
4356497 i wasnt expecting a medal i just focused on myself and sometimes the outcome is not what you expect
4356498 i was ninth after the semi finals i was out of the final so to get put in and come away with a silver is awesome
4356499 i dont know how or why about yesterday it was incredibly disappointing to be out of the final i had another opportunity again i didnt have that in athens
4356500 but i was very grateful that is standard in my career i have had several ups and downs i just took the chance given to me and did my best
4356501 she fought hard for it i fought hard for it it didnt take the edge off getting silver it is part of the olympics
4356502 theyre trying to whitewash their human rights record and present a pretty picture to the world when in fact behind the facade is an ugly reality and the situation in tibet is as bad as its been in a very long time

4356509 i took my apple out and started eating while i was working as well and she teacher said put that in the bin and you get a sanction and everybodys like but hes diabetic oh hes diabetic and then she was like oh sorry
4356510 he the teacher should have understood a bit more that i was low and didnt know what i was doing because i was talking complete nonsense which is a big sign of being low well my friends know how to react but other people in the class will know when im low and will tell somebody
4356511 i said by the time i get there shell be unconscious
4356512 previous studies have examined the role of parents in diabetes self care and found that parental influence decreases during adolescence as friendships and school life become more important during adolescence examining the influence of school personnel and peers was pertinent there were few studies examining this area so possible outcomes were unknown
4356513 the impact of teachers on young people with diabetes cannot be overestimated given that poorer self care increases the risk of complications including unconsciousness seizures and coma as well as serious long term problems such as blindness and kidney failure
4356514 diabetes is a legally recognised disability all young people with the condition have the right to appropriate school care to help them fully take part in school life young people with diabetes must be allowed to undertake care at any time at school schools need to make all staff aware of pupils with diabetes and their related care needs and staff must be trained in recognising and treating hypoglycaemia
4356515 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4356516 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
4356517 i have been intrigued for years by the question of how a cell knows what to do
4356518 it is exposed to a plethora of signals and many stimuli and somehow it moves forward in the right direction most of the time if it doesnt know what to do the cell may continue to divide and become a cancer
4356519 nature doesnt like chaos so there had to be something logical some process that tells the cell what to become a pathway that integrates a variety of stimuli and comes up with a conclusion
4356520 infs does that it tells the cell dont start anything until i tell you it also is called a safety mechanism its a bean counter it counts the signals and averages them until there is enough to open the gate
4356521 we were the first to have the guts to talk about it publicly it took courage and sticking to an important scientific principal to report on nature as it is rather than what was thought to be the situation when our theory challenged the established scientific opinion this unconventional anti doctrinaire approach has allowed us to explore areas and ideas that were overlooked by many scientists
4356522 integrative nuclear signaling in cell development a role for fgf receptor 1 appeared in the november 2007 issue of dna and cell biology
4356523 the infs pathway offers a novel target for in vivo neural stem cell therapies and anticancer strategies
4356524 it is a universal mechanism that can apply to many areas of biology we have a key now we can move on to develop therapies
4356525 within 24 hours of the plastic film being applied to a surface less than 1 bacterium out of 1 million bacteria will survive
4356526 it also reduces the environmental impact of the process and we have developed a method that is easy to apply and could bring great benefits to patients in hospitals as well as the food industry
4356527 this is an outstanding example of how chemical engineers are making a crucial contribution to society
4356528 neurological disorders are a critical area of need in terms of expanding our ability to design and conduct trials that have maximum efficiency at the lowest possible cost

4356561 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4356562 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

4356574 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4356575 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4356576 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4356577 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

4356590 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4356591 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4356592 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4356593 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4356594 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4356595 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4356596 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4356597 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4356598 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4356599 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4356600 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4356601 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4356602 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4356603 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4356604 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4356605 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4356606 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4356607 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4356608 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4356609 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4356610 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4356611 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4356612 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4356613 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4356614 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4356615 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4356616 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4356617 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4356618 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4356619 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
4356620 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
4356621 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
4356622 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
4356623 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
4356624 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
4356625 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
4356626 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
4356627 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
4356628 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4356629 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4356630 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4356631 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4356632 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4356633 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4356634 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4356635 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4356636 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4356637 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4356638 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4356639 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4356640 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4356641 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4356642 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4356643 our second quarter results reflect increasing chaotic trading card sales which we expect will ramp up considerably in the second half of the year
4356644 we believe that we are on track to meet our previously announced target of 20 30 million in chaotic trading card sales for 2008 we have made several scheduled improvements to the chaotic website including adding attack animation and sound effects to game play reintroducing the simpler 1 creature vs 1 creature game play for chaotic beginners and adding the more demanding 6 vs 6 game play for the more experienced chaotic players weve also implemented revisions enabling www chaoticgame com to operate on less technologically capable computers we expect that these initiatives will result in faster growth for the chaotic online community however in the short term expenditures related to improvements on the chaotic website and trading card company operations contributed to higher sg amp a costs for the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2007
4356645 although chaotic trading card sales came in on plan the second quarter was negatively impacted by lower licensing revenue attributable to our core properties
4356646 starting next month we will begin programming nine hours of childrens television on saturday mornings including a five hour block on
4356647 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4356648 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4356649 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4356650 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4356651 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4356652 they had seat belts on but there was no air bag deployed
4356653 it was an older model car that didnt have any
4356654 en defensa del castellano al que llaman la lengua com n
4356655 apadrine su acento cultive su elegancia y esc jalo en el baile de pareja
4356656 yo a adir a al manifiesto el reconocimiento que se debe a la enorme generosidad con que castilla nos ha dado su lengua cuando sta era camarada del imperio a los castellanos que te llevaban a la hoguera por un qu tame all esas filacterias bien que les gustaba darle la lengua a las indias
4356657 los ciudadanos piden que el gobierno les trate con m s madurez
4356658 los ciudadanos exigen que el presidente del gobierno les trate como a adultos
4356659 you place a piece of cloth with a sticky substance on it over your face as you might do with a band aid wait a bit for it to dry and then rip it off
4356660 if the instructions are followed closely you can see some benefit in removing the very surface of a blackhead in fact you may at first be very impressed with what comes off your nose unfortunately that leaves the majority of the problem deep in the pore
4356661 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4356662 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4356663 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4356664 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4356665 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4356666 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4356667 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4356668 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4356669 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4356670 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4356671 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4356672 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4356673 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4356674 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4356675 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4356676 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4356677 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4356678 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4356679 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4356680 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4356681 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4356682 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4356683 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4356684 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4356685 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4356686 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4356687 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4356688 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4356689 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4356690 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4356691 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4356692 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4356693 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4356694 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4356695 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4356696 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4356697 espa a est en la champions de la econom a
4356698 somos un pa s fuerte en empleo por nuestra persectiva hist rica
4356699 espa a est en el momento de la edad de oro del deporte
4356700 me la he puesto por bono y por respeto a los trabajadores de la casa a los que se les obliga a utilizar corbata para trabajar
4356701 en espa a el iphone lo tienen un colombiano que durmi en la calle y media docena de periodistas buenos chicos conozco el nombre de uno de ellos pero de momento me lo reservo aunque aprovecho para decir que yo por mi parte estoy dispuesto a escuchar
4356702 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4356703 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4356704 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4356705 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4356706 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4356707 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4356708 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4356709 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4356710 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4356711 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4356712 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4356713 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4356714 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4356715 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4356716 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4356717 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4356718 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4356719 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4356720 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4356721 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4356722 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4356723 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4356724 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4356725 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4356726 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4356727 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4356728 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4356729 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4356730 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4356731 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4356732 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4356733 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4356734 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4356735 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4356736 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4356737 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4356738 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4356739 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4356740 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4356741 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4356742 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4356743 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4356744 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4356745 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4356746 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4356747 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4356748 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4356749 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4356750 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4356751 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4356752 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4356753 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4356754 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4356755 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4356756 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4356757 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4356758 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4356759 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4356760 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4356761 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4356762 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4356763 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4356764 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4356765 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4356766 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4356767 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4356768 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4356769 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4356770 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4356771 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4356772 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4356773 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4356774 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4356775 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4356776 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4356777 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4356778 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4356779 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4356780 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4356781 less nuanced more direct cory doctorows little brother tor books hardcover is orwell for the teen set a young adult tale of fighting back against a department of homeland security run amok in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in san francisco apparently a popular target jailed and tortured seventeen year old marcus a hacker decides to take on the dhs theres little subtlety here the bad guys are bad guys the teens heroic and ultra competent but doctorows understanding of modern technology and his ability to connect with the next generation make little brother as close to a handbook for the resistance as any novel yet written
4356782 finally a few short takes on other books of interest editor john joseph adams seeds of change prime books hardcover tackles racism global warming peak oil and political revolution in an attractive hardcover featuring thought provoking short stories by rising stars like tobias buckell jay lake and mark budtz iain m banks use of weapons orbit books trade paperback perhaps the most incisive and shocking commentary on war since vonneguts slaughterhouse five is now back in print and john grants corrupted science fraud ideology and politics fff hardcover which includes a scathing expose of george w bushs subversion of science that reads more like fiction than fact has just been given a big push by the publisher and is once again available in your local chain bookstore
4356783 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4356784 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4356785 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4356786 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4356787 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4356788 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4356789 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4356790 top level leaders and very senior level officials in 5 provincial governments and 4 cities
4356791 i would also like to thank the peoples republic of china government for its willingness to assist fiji in moving forward particularly their support for initiatives in building a better fiji and fijis return to parliamentary democracy
4356792 i watched as folks who were there to describe their evidence for extraterrestrial visitation laid into the guests who were skeptical bill nye the science guy and me
4356793 if the only way the investigator can convince others is by insisting that their audience shift careers and start doing their work then somethings gravely amiss
4356794 i used to work on fusion propulsion systems its the energy in the sun
4356795 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4356796 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4356797 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
4356798 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
4356799 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and sorrow ive brought you
4356800 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because i dont know if i am worthy
4356801 i ask the lord to please forgive me ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4356802 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4356803 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4356804 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4356805 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4356806 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4356807 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4356808 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4356809 she stuck basically all the tumbling passes thats incredible to do
4356810 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4356811 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4356812 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4356813 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4356814 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4356815 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4356816 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4356817 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4356818 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4356819 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4356820 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4356821 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4356822 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4356823 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4356824 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
4356825 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4356826 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
4356827 so if i can prove that i dont need this loan you will give it to me
4356828 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
4356829 gender disappointment feeling disappointed about the gender of your baby
4356830 gender disappointment is fairly common and is nothing to feel ashamed about
4356831 according to sara rosenquist ph d a chapel hill psychologist who specializes in new parent issues feelings of guilt and disappointment are common among postpartum parents even though they often feel they cant talk about these feelings to family and friends
4356832 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4356833 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4356834 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4356835 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4356836 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4356837 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4356838 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4356839 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4356840 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4356841 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4356842 it wouldnt have taken a genius long to recognize the corrupting influence of money in american politics
4356843 but it took me a long time to recognize it
4356844 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4356845 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4356846 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4356847 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4356848 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4356849 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4356850 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4356851 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair

4356854 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4356855 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4356856 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4356857 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4356858 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4356859 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4356860 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4356861 the club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber drc on the claim made against adrian mutu
4356862 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68 million in compensation
4356863 we are proud to be at the forefront of the green energy revolution with our alternative energy and services division
4356864 the divisions hybrid energy tm products are expected to dramatically decrease heating and hot water costs
4356865 we are always looking for ways to save our customers money
4356866 in addition the energy from the sun is free its supplies are unlimited and using solar energy produces no air or water pollution
4356867 with c k smiths hybrid energy tm solar products more than 90 percent of incoming solar radiation is transferred to heat and the system covers over 75 percent of hot water needs for a family of four
4356868 everything you ever wanted to talk about in church but were afraid to ask
4356869 we selected solarcraft for this project because they were clearly one of the top companies available to us in the industry they have proven to have been an excellent choice
4356870 with eight offices nationwide and 1 500 attorneys and staff we are focused on cost effective ways to reduce our energy consumption and environmental impact
4356871 in addition we count as clients in our clean technology practice some of the leading entrepreneurs and investors in the world who have further inspired all of us at cooley to do our part
4356872 many companies are going green these days and it is no longer based strictly on the financial benefits it may be based on environmental concerns financial stability or to be good stewards of the environment and ensure a positive impact in the community it is a pleasure to be involved in an industry where we work with forward thinking and progressive individuals who want to do good by doing right
4356873 synergy has a seven year history of professional services in research development and procurement in china
4356874 the consumer product division will continue to exist within synergy
4356875 however the long term objective of the company is to provide sourcing and product development services in the green technology industry
4356876 as a healthcare company we are concerned about our environment
4356877 supporting the use of clean reliable solar power is consistent with our business mission we also expect to realize energy savings by reducing the amount of electricity we need to purchase from the grid
4356878 utc power is expanding its capability to provide clean energy and sustainable services for building owners
4356879 while our traditional focus has been on fuel cell and microturbine based products we recognize our customers may require a broader range of services products and financial solutions to meet their energy needs
4356880 companies like merck that take a comprehensive approach and combine traditional energy conservation measures with supporting clean renewable energy sources are the most effective at reducing energy consumption and helping to reverse the effects of climate change
4356881 were targeting sales of 100 000 units of this new vehicle in north america
4356882 for the long term we continue to see the development of fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate solution
4356883 while this technology is more than a decade away from the mass market we know it works because weve been advancing it in the real world with real customers
4356884 we know directionally if we can develop the infrastructure to support that car and we can get the volume out of it its a true direction we can go for new fuel efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gasses
4356885 when the ministry of justice bought the site back in march 2007 it set the alarms bells ringing
4356886 id say 95 of local people are opposed to the plans which is why we have organised the protest group and meeting
4356887 were worried because early indications are that cwmbran is the favourite place for the prison to be built
4356888 as a councillor and a mother im very concerned because we dont know the implications of having a prison in such a built up area
4356889 we dont see why one should be built here especially when there are other areas like wrexham that actually want the prison
4356890 were not opposed to a prison were opposed to the place where they want to place it
4356891 i just think that you cant put a prison in a populated residential area with schools in the 21st century
4356892 it might have been all right in victorian times but not today
4356893 but its not just that its going to effect the economic prosperity of the area as having prison nearby is going to bring house prices right down
4356894 theres upwards of 4 000 homes in the area around the site thats not people thats just houses so its going to effect a lot of peoples lives
4356895 i can understand the money side of it because all the roads and other facilities are already in place here while the other places dont have them
4356896 but what i dont understand is that although wrexham hasnt got these things they actually want the prison so why not give it to them we just dont want it
4356897 we were very worried at the time parc was first announced mostly because the thought of a prison in a quiet village like ours was quite frightening
4356898 we were worried about what might happen when the prisoners were released or when their families came to visit
4356899 but it hasnt worried us at all we have built up great contacts with the prison and theyve helped us financially with items for the village including paying for new gates for coity castle
4356900 we have even had some lovely hanging baskets made by the prisoners
4356901 so i would tell people in cwmbran and elsewhere not to worry
4356902 there is a need for a prison in north wales because all our prisoners have to go to england and we believe its vital to have a local prison to help reduce reoffending by working with prisoners in their own communities
4356903 it is also important to look at female prisoners and young offenders both of whom have to travel outside north wales and in the case of young offenders that can mean being housed more than 200 miles from their families
4356904 with all the prison places in england it is very difficult for first language welsh speakers to get any education or training in their own language

4356914 theyve incorporated all their latest and greatest service features and these new products are better able to take advantage of the changing needs of business professionals
4356915 when we started developing these systems 18 months ago we focused on the biggest pain points for users and managers alike and worked to turn those into features that address the problems

4356920 this is a wonderful place i will come back and visit it often
4356921 that is a horrible place and i will never go back there again
4356922 thats ok sweetheart youre just down on your luck and nobody appreciates you
4356923 well since i cant run with the big dogs ill just stay on the porch
4356924 i called the company this morning to get more information and spokesman steve swasey was candid forthcoming and easily accessible hallmarks of good damage control when a company is under the gun as soon as i got off the phone with him i went on the air and broke this story
4356925 i love writing i love the swirl and swing of words as they tangle with human emotions
4356926 you dont have to get it right you just have to get it going
4356927 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
4356928 i know but i just want to make sure that i dont ever do anything that makes you think it could be anything more
4356929 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future

4356932 a quarter of my life has almost past i think ive come to see myself at last and i see that the time spent confused is the time that ive spent without you
4356933 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4356934 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4356935 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4356936 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4356937 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4356938 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4356939 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4356940 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4356941 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4356942 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this
4356943 a shared national purpose and a strong bond between people and government
4356944 the danger is that the consultation is purely amongst the articulate
4356945 when obedience to the law is no longer for conscience sake then alone can we surmise that the twilight of values has set in and that the reign of force has taken the place of the rule of reason
4356946 many labour mps remain in thrall to utopian theories of human nature and believe that criminals are driven to commit offences by social exclusion they are not really responsible its society that should change
4356947 the criminal justice system plays a part in moral education
4356948 this is on any view a tragic story arising out of irreconcilable cultural differences between traditional kurdish values and the values of western society
4356949 at my school muslims are allowed to wear headscarves and other faiths can wear bangles and other types of jewelry and it feels like christians are being discriminated against
4356950 that a uk bill of rights and freedoms is desirable in order to provide necessary protection to all and to marginalised and vulnerable people in particular
4356951 the archbishops comments are unhelpful and may add to the confusion that already exists in our communities all british citizens must be subject to british laws developed through parliament and the courts
4356952 natural law may provide that common ground where we can begin to draw all men everywhere together in a unity that reflects what is common to human beings as human beings
4356953 i love you and i want you at my side
4356954 dear father i cant come home too much has passed between us the distance is too far
4356955 return as far as you can my son and i will come to you the rest of the way
4356956 return as far as you can and i will come to you the rest of the way
4356957 our concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
4356958 the master of this world who bears no evil within himself
4356959 at the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life
4356960 civic courage particularly noticeable among the ruling and intellectual elites
4356961 for these two privileges are most closely related to each other christ has overcome sin and death by his own death and one who is reborn in a heavenly way through baptism has through christ himself conquered sin and death however in accord with his general rule god does not wish to grant the full effect of victory over death to the just until the end of time shall have come yet god wished that the blessed virgin mary be exempt from this general law for she by a completely singular privilege conquered sin in her immaculate conception and thus was not liable to that law of remaining in the corruption of the grave nor did she have to wait for the end of time for the redemption of her body
4356962 i know you love me jesus and i love you right now im alone and afraid i really need to know you love me i could really use a hug from you more than a hug lord i need someone to hold me theres no one to hold me close
4356963 hi penny dont think im strange but im here to tell you jesus loves you very much very much and here im supposed to give you this
4356964 its very pretty penny it will look nice on you
4356965 i do i was just at the hospital too i was there for the death of my pastor he passed away at just the moment he would have been finishing his homily jesus always has me there when people die im always right there with them
4356966 jesus loves you he has always loved you jesus wants to hold you just like this blessed be the lord
4356967 and you will always be on my prayer list penny

4356970 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4356971 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4356972 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4356978 is that dementia is not speedily killing people but it leads to a huge amount of disabilities and long term needs for care
4356979 there was a very socialist theatre group in the 70s
4356980 called 7 84 its name derived from a survey revealing that in the uk the 7 of the population owned the 84 of wealth the 10 66 title derives from a similar concept only 10 of all population based research into dementia is directed towards the developing world where roughly 66 of all people with dementia live ive been interested in issues of equality since my youth
4356981 the population in the developing world is huge and despite the fact that in a country like india only 5 of population are aged over 65 a billion people live there the problem is moreover dangerously increasing because of general demographic aging
4356982 india china latin america africa have a lot of current priorities in terms of health policies malaria tuberculosis hiv
4356983 dementia is unfortunately not yet recognized as a main concern we can say that its a cinderella disease it is indeed a growing problem especially in terms of costs on health systems there is a new need for governments of all countries to plan for that
4356984 but like cancer or stroke in western countries are yet to be defined as epidemic dementia is the new threat well deal with in the next 30 40 years the growth of dementia will be rapid and much faster in poorer countries it is expected to double in nearly 20 years
4356985 because risk factors can be similar but even very different if they will come out of research as similar thats a cause for concern because they are the same at the origin of cardiovascular disease as to say smoking low levels of exercise obesity lifestyle is changing rapidly in developing countries and they are adopting western habits
4356986 the only problem with him is its hard meeting him
4356987 there is a spice in india the curcumin used in curry that has antioxidant properties it is supposed that the high level of this spice in the indian diet can protect against alzheimers disease if that was established it might lead to some new diet advice for prevention and prevention is a matter of a healthy lifestyle both physical and mental
4356988 give me also this ability so that everyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
4356989 you have seen correctly this is the baptism in the spirit
4356990 many christians stop with the overflowing of the mouth but the purpose of the spirit baptism is to take you down to the bottom to the ground of humility so that i can do my work through you without any hindrance
4356991 for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
4356992 but i could not why i had received the baptism in the spirit with the speaking in tongues as the bible evidence according to acts 2 4 and had not received the gift of tongues according to 1 corinthians 12 i had received the giver of all gifts at some time later when i was helping some souls to seek and receive the baptism of the spirit god gave me the gift of tongues so that i could speak at any time
4356993 whats up bitches get it im a bitch and i was all just whats up bitches is that beagle across the street new here whattaya say we shake a tail over there check that hottie out bark bark

4356995 oh she just missed you so much she wanted to show you by giving your leg a big hug ha ha isnt that sweet
4356996 the messages of the prophets must be understood first of all on their own terms
4356997 it is also important to remember that the books of prophecy like the rest of scripture have christ as their central focus and theme luke 22 44 49 we must read the prophets and hear their messages in light of all that god has done in christ
4356998 oh i hate such and such by the way search me and show me if theres anything you dont like
4356999 why do you ley your enemies speak such a way about you kill em i would
4357000 smash my enemies to bits then take the bits and smash em again the light them on fire
4357001 structured this book around various apologetic issues that arise in the loci communes theologiae

4357004 the apostles and other people of god were filled with the spirit and empowered to carry out the great commission to all people acts highlights the ministries of peter chs 1 12 and paul chs 13 28
4357005 all the fullness of deity dwells in the son bodily
4357006 each of the three is fully and entirely the one
4357007 each of the three is fully and entirely one god
4357008 not that each of the 3 are fully and entirely the one

4357011 niv 1 peter 3 7 husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers
4357012 jesus according to matthews gospel was born about 6 bc
4357013 jesus was according to the information in matthews gospel born six years before christ
4357014 since it costs so much must be very scholarly and important
4357015 jesus christ and god the father are not separate persons they said
4357016 in his zeal ended up swinging the pendulum way to the right in overemphasizing the deity of christ contrary to arianism apollinarius compromised the humanity of christ
4357017 overemphasized the one person to him christ was a third thing the human and divine natures conjoined in such a way as to create a new being
4357018 but i think sometimes we tend to treat god as if hes common and in my mind he deserves better than that
4357019 this should hold him over until i send him the collected works of greg boyd c o d
4357020 but that is not consistent with giving hermeneutical priority to his words over his actions
4357021 being evangelical requires firm adherence to a humanly devised cognitive structure of doctrinal content
4357022 ought to be a concept heavily invested with cognitive content christian orthodoxy ought to be part of its very definition and that orthodoxy should be fairly detailed
4357023 tended to be inwardly focused in its experientialism with an outlook on salvation heavily influenced by synergism
4357024 tended to be more publicly focused and its outlook on salvation was definitely reformed or calvinistic
4357025 postconservatives like conservatives presuppose revelation but they consider its main purpose to be transformation rather than information noting that this emphasis colors everything else
4357026 is a pilgrimage and a journey rather than a discovery and a conquest
4357027 the constructive task of theology is always open there are no closed once and for all systems of theology
4357028 p ostconservative evangelical theologians have raised red flags over this issue and declared that evangelical theology needs to be liberated from the enlightenment and that some forms of postmodern thought can help in that liberation process
4357029 postconservatives presuppose revelation but they consider its main purpose to be transformation rather than information
4357030 these and other conservative evangelicals have worked with an enlightenment inspired philosophical method known as foundationalism that prizes rational certainty and elevates propositions and coherent systems almost to idols
4357031 if you hold to a foundationalism of truth on what grounds do you know that your foundation is actually truth
4357032 look weve seen it so we know it corresponds to the way things actually are

4357041 if you dont need e sata ie running an external sata drive leave it off
4357042 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4357043 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4357044 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4357045 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4357046 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start

4357059 hell would have to freeze over for us to sell dean to a major rival
4357060 im all right i dont want to go but im cool about it
4357061 stuarts very nice but hes got a lot of support as well

4357065 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4357066 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4357067 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4357068 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4357069 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4357070 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4357071 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4357072 i am deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe where despite requests made by the united nations country team and other humanitarian partners operations of voluntary and non governmental organisations remain restricted
4357073 lifted immediately so that aid organisations can carry out their relief work and avert a catastrophic humanitarian crisis
4357074 what we have seen in the past with the commonwealth grants commission is that theyve always had enough political pressure on them to take into consideration the unique position of queensland as the most decentralised state
4357075 weve always been able to maintain a significant advantage even from the labor party have protested against it
4357076 they will enable necessary repairs to be undertaken quickly and allow the churches concerned to continue to play an active role in the communities they serve
4357077 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4357078 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4357079 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4357080 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4357081 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4357082 the findings of the israeli investigation are confusing and offer no convincing explanation of the circumstances that led to the reuters cameramans death
4357083 only an impartial analysis of what happened would be able to prevent this kind of tragedy from recurring instead of reassuring the press the israeli military is fostering an unacceptable climate of fear and danger
4357084 if journalists are wearing flak jackets keeping a reasonable distance from the belligerents and clearly displaying press markings there should be a change in the behaviour of the soldiers in areas where civilians including journalists are present
4357085 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
4357086 we have intelligence inputs about extremist groups planning to target prominent leaders and symbols of national importance

4357090 i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the public distribution system pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices
4357091 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4357092 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4357093 insulate the poorer sections of society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices
4357094 all over the world there is growing realisation of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change
4357095 it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy
4357096 after almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004 investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area
4357097 in a time of tight budgets difficult choices have to be made we must make sure our very limited resources are spent on priorities i believe we should have no higher priority than investing in our childrens classrooms and in their future
4357098 n ever base your budget requests on realistic assumptions as this could lead to a decrease in your funding
4357099 e ven though i can make my own budgets i always ask for less money than we need so that you have to be more creative you have to strip it down
4357100 i felt a little sluggish but my body has woken up now
4357101 every time i breathe it hurts but its a case of mind over matter
4357102 harris repeatedly manipulated seemingly innocent everyday situations to his advantage to create any excuse to touch me improperly more specifically to fondle or to grab my genitals
4357103 as a result for years i have lived with intense anxiety sleeplessness and night terrors
4357104 the experience also has affected my personal relationships with women

4357109 thriving ivory is one of the hottest bands currently featured on you oughta know a program that showcases bands artists on the rise
4357110 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4357111 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4357112 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4357113 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4357114 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4357115 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4357116 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4357117 its hard because shes always the one that keeps everyone else up
4357118 upgrading patriot fire units from configuration 2 to configuration 3 enhances the systems capabilities to meet current and emerging threats
4357119 as the prime contractor for the patriot system raytheon is committed to ensuring our patriot systems continue to provide superior affordable and reliable air and missile defense capability to meet the armys mission
4357120 the u s armys upgrade to configuration 3 is leading the way as many of our international patriot partners around the globe are similarly upgrading the patriot system as a key component in their air and missile defenses
4357121 we have canceled our participation in a multi national naval exercise with russia that was due to begin tomorrow
4357122 weve also canceled a us canadian russian exercise vigilant eagle that was to have begun august 20th

4357124 the svf technology can also be adapted to many applications beyond the maritime domain where it is necessary to monitor complex evolving situations and dynamically identify events or objects that require attention
4357125 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4357126 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4357127 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4357128 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4357129 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4357130 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party

4357133 by firing the laser through the beam control system for the first time the atl team has begun to demonstrate the functionality of the entire weapon system integrated aboard the aircraft

4357135 they are a good ally im sure the mil to mil military relationship will continue and well be looking at what their needs are
4357136 let us ask the americans to convince us that the cargo on board these planes is indeed humanitarian aid

4357145 this capability will greatly enhance the sea services ability to project power and successfully complete a ship to objective maneuver
4357146 the shield is meant to defend the united states not us on the contrary all it will do is put us in danger
4357147 russia has already warned that if the shields set up it will react the situation in georgia shown perfectly well that you have to take russian threats seriously
4357148 we would have preferred the old runway to be used for a civilian airport so we could increase tourism on the beautiful baltic beaches
4357149 we believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue and we are always ready for dialogue
4357150 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4357151 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4357152 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4357153 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time
4357154 its a new science and there is something new to learn everyday the sun is always shining somewhere so we are busy 24 7
4357155 sometimes it takes a special effort to get out there and see what your warfighter is confronted with
4357156 we have some of the sharpest people in the air force
4357157 they must be technically solid and be able to interpret data from leading edge satellite systems
4357158 i know everything i do helps the success of aircraft and troops on the ground in iraq and afghanistan
4357159 this round will enable ac 130 crews to train effectively with the armor piercing round and conserve available quantities of scarce and expensive high explosive incendiary ammunition for combat use
4357160 if you dont see it hit you cant adjust fire
4357161 this was an incredibly fast turnaround to provide this solution something we never could have obtained this fast from industry
4357162 we had the right people at the right time to develop a great solution
4357163 we established goals for the round by looking at the test targets and working backwards we recognized the critical need for our solution to work and our team just clicked
4357164 we were lucky to have everything locally we needed to produce this solution the customer developer and test capability are all here on the emerald coast
4357165 this round will enable ac 130 crews to train effectively with the armor piercing round and conserve available quantities of scarce and expensive high explosive incendiary ammunition for combat use
4357166 these may have some application in urban environments where collateral damage must be limited with no high explosive component these rounds could be effective for suppression fire
4357167 technology coerces beings which are governed by a hidden law of emergence and withdrawal into perpetual presence
4357168 the ecological problem is an aesthetic crisis the world is becoming increasingly less beautiful because of technology leavening heidegger with a measure of largely forgotten medieval aesthetics i maintain that we have forgotten the ontological relevance of the beautiful and the aesthetic relevance of the ontological we have allowed our technology to develop without consideration for aesthetic effect i offer three criteria for a technology that allows the beautiful to occur fittingness transparency and self containment
4357169 beauty is a concordance and fittingness of a thing to itself and of all its individual parts to themselves and to each other and to the whole and of the whole to all things italics mine
4357170 to be beautiful in a technical way is to let nature show itself through technology
4357171 a self contained technology lets form shine without eclipsing nature
4357172 so my father was not the only one we all give too much importance to the idea of a world with a center

4357183 su mam lo dio de baja por que le dijeron que tomara las clases con todos
4357184 in the light of an article appearing in todays edition of the mmegi newspaper
4357185 in this world of change nothing which comes stays and nothing which goes is lost
4357186 now the humor is over its many days later so lets lose the comedy and get to the point because by the time you continue this you wont be in the mood for laughter
4357187 thats reassuring what the hell happens that makes me such a sourpuss
4357188 a drawing forces you to look for a good photo of her from a profile view and the pose gets you a little retrospective
4357189 as specific as that was it wouldnt be the first time thats happened so i cant even put much stock into it
4357190 im not here to prove to you that i exist that wouldnt be too fair would it
4357191 yes i know youre here to destroy her and i weve been through that enough times
4357192 on one note yes thats a goal of mine but at the moment im here to drag some deep seeded feeling from you talk about her like i said just speak and the words will come to you you will lose yourself in her
4357193 well i i dont really know where to start theres a lot to talk about
4357194 i suppose i can give you a boost your memories of her talk about your memories this is always a great place to pick up the emotion quickly
4357195 memories sigh alright well i suppose the one that stands out most in my mind is her wedding seeing her in a white dress seeing that big red smile under dark bordered eyes i saw her fair clear skinned crimson lips in an understated traditional white dress and following was the tall pasty dark eyed bridegroom a man whos appearance didnt lend well to formal attire and whos demeanor was inherently simple and easy going this made it near impossible to judge the nature of his lax behavior was it care free or careless the answer came in on the latter end and with all the fervor of a disorganized parade but my words have digressed from my thoughts it was then that an odd change had taken place at this time i began to feel a distance being created she was keeping something from me and it was clear that it was something between her and i but i never asked about it i just complained about feeling left out of the wedding during the issue of being removed as best man without my knowledge its been my biggest downfall when regarding our friendship every issue we ever had could be directly contributed to my feeling as if i were being replaced with her husband it was not nearly as large an issue i was legitimately happy for her regardless of any feeling as though i could have been standing there
4357196 but you were always able to separate your emotion for her from your judgment of those she became interested in though youve always questioned your own motives and were reserved as a result of that you need not worry that youre biased youve looked after her best interests putting yourself aside far more times than youve been selfish with her thats not to say youve never been selfish with her because you have but never over something as important to you as her happiness
4357197 good to know but you know as well as i do that thats not going to keep me from beating myself up every time i want to express discomfort over even the clearest of issues other memories most of them arent even of any specific event but rather of moments in time where we were close holding her when she was upset those times were always my favorite times being the support being given the opportunity to take care of her knowing it was then that i could freely give up on my own inhibitions to be there whole heartedly for her i didnt have to think about myself i wasnt as important as what she was going through in that moment knowing that it was never to feel good about myself the feeling of having no concern for myself but all focus has been moved to someone elses needs is the greatest feeling in the world and the act doesnt beget the gratification the gratification is no condition by which the act is done its the emotion that begets the act all i can think of now is the heat emanating from her body feeling the cold beads on my chest as my shirt soaks up the tears the top of her head pressing under my cheek bone my hand under the back of her head fingers tangled in the thick short waves of her hair kissing the top of her head kissing her always just the tip of the tongue how her upper lip was soft and warm but her lower lip just where they meet was cool and wet and how every time she would pull away just a little at the end and come back again there was another world in those wide dark eyes always something going on behind them always anxious always worried often suspicious that anyone could find her out feeling as though i was a danger to her natural tendency to reserve the depths of the origin of her personality the things that make her who she is why shes obsessed with the darker side of life what triggered her interest in specific acts against her that only one person knows about she hides a great deal from me hoping that though my intuition has allowed me to surmise a great deal about her it wont lead me to the truths of her past that she holds very very close her posture was one that did not hide her mortality however there were always moments of understood elegance when she smokes though she slouches often her lips pucker and her pinky finger juts out as if shes holding a champaign glass i always thought it a perfect example of her to watch her smoke though much of the time as most of her body shows she is hard strong and human but a small part of her that she tends to keep well hidden as the smallest gesture of the pinky yearns to be an elegant immortal image of woman kind she holds the symbol of her mortality like a fragile glassware grail
4357198 its what i do ive made a lifetime of studying movement and finding poses to remember as symbolizing a certain state of being i always wanted my characters to be unique in that they express themselves more human like than any other cartoon characters ever created
4357199 theres something about her that ive tried to describe to her its difficult its her humanity its everything about her as its created this person literally everything that makes her up as an entity her thoughts her feelings her physical appearance physical make up posture memories history every moment of her life as time slowly broke down in her mind who she is meant to be and how devastatingly clear it is that this process continues for her and the fact that i see all this and appreciate all this as much as i do which is an indescribable amount makes me feel good about what im capable of understanding and it is this which makes me worry that she may never find someone who sees her in this light its too incredible to be commonplace there is nothing conditional or temporary about it it encompasses everything that can be loved about a person and so i know that there is nothing greater than it it is impossible to find anything more to love about a single person impossible it seems transcendent it goes beyond a finite level into something like like a memory of a past life something inside me has been somewhere with this person that ive never been but it returned with the memories of its journey and it shares this with me only through feeling from which i have to develop my own memory of what that feeling represents often it reminds me of being an adolescent alone in the dead of a dreary winter afternoon just outside the city standing under a long steel railroad overpass and i see her face in the rear passenger seat of the only car on the road sitting at a stop sign an old gray 80s model and my only thoughts are of what kind of person she might be and what it would be like to know her but this girl is heading somewhere and i know ill never see her again but i feel connected to her in a dreary distant dark dreamy sort of way thats what happens i cant believe i was actually able to describe it so closely though i dont imagine it helps any as far as some insight into the absolute strangest phenomenon about me what it does is it reminds me that i dont care what kind of memory i see her in as long as shes involved in creating them
4357200 it wont be any consolation but i know precisely what emotion you speak of and no one will ever fully understand what the hell you go through when it happens ever its far too difficult to describe people may get that it sends you to another world of vivid imagery but theyll never know that feeling that cold distant phantasm and that is the best word to describe it its very much a phantasm the problem is people have different perceptions of what a phantasm entails
4357201 ive tried to explain to her what happens to me ive mentioned that antique objects can set it off being in an old house especially one inhabited by a friend whos lived there his or her entire life there is a definite aura of memories a physical aura that penetrates the body and is picked up by the brain ive often wondered if its this feeling that crackpots always confuse with some spiritual presence ghost hunters hoping to find ghosts when really its nothing more than the residue of strong memories tied to memorable events ive never been one to believe in ghosts but there is without a doubt some presence of something i wont pretend to know what it is
4357202 its been so long since we talked about it i remember she took an interest and asked questions but i dont think she ever really understood what i was trying to describe it wasnt the presence of spirits but of human memories an aura not an entity
4357203 and it occurred to you recently that this may be one reason shes scared of you as she said
4357204 i wonder that it isnt a mess of strange things i wouldnt consider myself the most average person in the world and there are certainly things about me that would make anyone worry
4357205 well it isnt as though i have a choice with you constantly badgering me about every detail
4357206 even so you worry that people may think youre using me as a place to lay blame on your persistent thoughts about her you worry that people may think i dont exist that perhaps you made me up to help cope with your personal issues and while you and i know that it isnt the case who would ever believe that this is anything more than your subconscious creating an interesting and symbolic setting for you to work through your problems with her and the boy
4357207 it doesnt matter what i do or say those who believe that are going to believe it either way
4357208 very true do you think she believes that im really here
4357209 i dont know i really dont i think she has enough evidence with eris to believe its at least possible but that doesnt mean she believes me
4357210 youre going to get tired around this time you ought to rest
4357211 are you trying to give me advice days before i even need it or know of its necessity
4357212 i suppose so but the real issue is i dont want you to move from this conversation into a new one by sliding into this bar half asleep while youre posting
4357213 you mean you dont want me typing in my sleep
4357214 sort of i suppose thats one way to put it

4357220 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
4357221 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4357222 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4357223 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4357224 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

4357230 terasnya adalah pemimpin islam dan tidak semestinya pas yang menjadi teras dia ikut keadaan semasa
4357231 saya tidak menerima andaian berkenaan kita pas membuat kerjasama dengan pakatan rakyat berbeza dengan umno dalam barisan nasional bn
4357232 kita hanya membuat persefahaman pilihanraya yang longgar pakatan tidak sama dengan barisan
4357233 di perak kita menang enam kerusi dun dewan undangan negeri tetapi kita menjadi mb menteri besar
4357234 kita beri pandangan supaya mengekalkan pegawai kerajaan kerana pengalaman kita di kelantan dan terengganu apabila dilantik orang politik banyak masalah
4357235 keputusan ini adalah perbincangan di peringkat pakatan rakyat bukan di dalam media
4357236 kerana ketika ini pakatan rakyat tidak ada ketua maka anwar yang paling layak
4357237 kita akan membincangkan siapakah pemimpin yang akan menjadi perdana menteri yang boleh diterima oleh semua rakyat oleh itu kita kena tunggu pada 16 september

4357239 i want to inform you that you got a hall hall 12
4357240 hall 12 ill send the email now now do you want a single room
4357241 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4357242 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4357243 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4357244 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4357245 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4357246 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4357247 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4357248 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4357249 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4357250 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4357276 the heavy heroin and crack using population is stable and appears to be ageing we havent seen an influx of young people at the bottom end
4357277 there has been a shift in the cannabis market with home grown pushing out the imported stuff but because it is stronger people are smoking less of it
4357278 in order to maintain its position on prohibition the government has to show that all drug use is dangerous
4357279 we need legal control and regulation of drug use that is how we manage use of alcohol and we need the same for drugs
4357280 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4357281 the more he talked the deeper he dug the hole
4357282 earth to john the national enquirer now officially has more credibility than you do
4357283 i dont think there has been an intentional distancing as a result of this it was already expected that he would not be returning to the center
4357284 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4357285 we got a little lucky and were also a little bit good
4357286 they pay people to talk to them were not in a position to do that
4357287 again and again in trying to pursue this story we would be asked by people who were central to it whats in it for me theyve the enquirer offered me 50 000 what do you have we have a cup of coffee so were at a disadvantage there
4357288 this is true we do pay sources and this is a case where we were able to use that policy to get the truth
4357289 there were quite a few people who worked on the event and hosted it
4357290 so theres no way of knowing who would have raised which money
4357291 we are investing significant time resources and manpower to ensure north carolina stays red in november

4357293 if i didnt have that on itd be black and blue tonight
4357294 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4357295 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4357296 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4357297 i also make things that i enjoy making i enjoy making yeast bread and i enjoy making pies
4357298 its an odd situation but it was that way last year and its that way again this year

4357310 since the majority of our emissions derive from the coal fired energy generation sector the committee feels that this sector should begin making faster headway with regard to capture
4357311 we have suggested that financial incentives be considered by the government as encouragement to those early investors in this new industry
4357312 geological surveys have indicated that the storage formations in offshore waters have the potential to securely store hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide for many thousands of years
4357313 this place was rebuilt with my money and ive been waiting two long fragmented years of my college experience to see it reopen so i think at the very least i have a right to take pictures
4357314 bush did sit down with the premiere olympic sportscaster of all time bob costas to discuss what he thought was so weird about the invasion on screen bush saying he thought it was odd russia invaded georgia during a time when the world is promoting peace and harmony and that there needs to be international mediation there yes sometimes international mediation can solve conflicts thats president bush winning the preliminary heat in the 200 meter lack of self awareness dash on screen bush saying america doesnt seem to have any problems i think that might be our biggest problem
4357315 john mccain has been accused of stealing policy ideas from wikipedia which is ridiculous everybody knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
4357316 a lot of people have said a guy who cant use a computer is the wrong person for the white house last time i checked the president only needs to know how to press one button and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets congressional quarterly reported this week that john mccain may have copied some facts in a recent speech on the georgian crisis from wikipedia i think it should have been obvious when he referred to the countrys leader as president 404 error file not found
4357317 you know he really is adorable he shouldnt be our president he should be our mascot
4357318 a republican politician form idaho has endorsed barack obama the last time a republican switched sides was in an tortillasdelote says

4357320 vice president dick cheney is in baghdad while he was in iraq he said that its a successful endeavor at least i think thats what he said it was hard to hear over the explosions
4357321 john mccain and barack obama have both laid out their energy plans obama wants enough green energy to power the entire u s economy and mccain just wants enough power to keep his energy friends in the green

4357324 they didnt carry any avalanche transceivers or probes and they didnt have a shovel each as far as im aware
4357325 travelling in the mountains in winter carrying that should be mandatory they would have been able to dig each other out in an avalanche
4357326 for us it didnt seem like they had a lot they rented a couple of pairs of plastic climbing boots and some harnesses as far as im aware they seemed to have the basics like packs and clothing they were really well set up with that
4357327 it is an extreme environment its an alpine area a place where you need to be on your game
4357328 at the moment were in a sizeable storm and theres been about 1m of snow up in the mountains and no visibility
4357329 over the whole area the avalanche risk is high to extreme
4357330 they would be experiencing below freezing temperatures if theyre exposed it could be 5c to 8c with strong winds and driving snow
4357331 hopefully they are holed up in a snow cave somewhere
4357332 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

4357339 we gaan naar het ziekenhuis en laten fotos maken hij heeft heel veel pijn
4357340 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4357341 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
4357342 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
4357343 it was one of those nights where we didnt get the big hit like we have
4357344 i dont really care who it is i dont like losing
4357345 i didnt perform today and i didnt give the team a chance from that standpoint its frustrating
4357346 i like what he did against an offensive phillies team hes got the weapons to pitch with
4357347 what shes feeling today is a little disappointment because you know how much hard work you put in and for swimmers the olympics is it
4357348 there are events that i cant stand and i do them anyway
4357349 if you want longevity in this sport you have to make sure that youre picking events that you really are excited to do and not just because they chose you
4357350 im going to be in the sport a while and i want some fun
4357351 this schedule you dont go into it as excited as i feel like i would if i was only swimming just two or three and a relay
4357352 it just didnt happen some days your body just doesnt work my body picked a bad time not to work
4357353 i do really well just kind of being in a stable environment
4357354 not traveling much not switching things up much maybe if it hadnt been quite as long it would have been better
4357355 even though i had disappointing swims i went to the olympics
4357356 i feel like im just beginning on my way hopefully ill go on to bigger and better things in the future
4357357 shes just human we make mistakes and we learn from it
4357358 shes still so young shes going to look back and its just going to be a great learning experience for her
4357359 the last one was pretty much a complete disaster in many ways so shes way ahead of the game
4357360 with every race i think shes kind of grown a little bit and gotten better shes doing these tough doubles too and she made the choice to do that and has handled all of that extremely well
4357361 clearly the future direction of interest rates and employment levels will impact on the environment in which the company will be operating in fiscal 2009 it said
4357362 in these circumstances it is not possible at this time to accurately forecast results for the 2009 year
4357363 big ticket trader nick scali is more exposed than other retailers to interest rate rises and any slowdown in home building activity
4357364 the march interest rate rise appears to have had the most significant impact on consumer spending patterns that the company has seen for many years the retailer said at the time
4357365 tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4357366 i spent many a sleepless night before i finally found the right recipe
4357367 we hit it right on the nose i still say thats some of the best sand ive ever seen in the world
4357368 but the chinese really wanted to use sand from their country i think it was a pride thing
4357369 the quality of the sand is hugely important to the game
4357370 this sand is beautiful wherever they brought it from is great
4357371 thanks to the sand we could go on with the playing without delay
4357372 when the players are psychologically comfortable with the sand they can dive and jump without any problems
4357373 there are more volleys and whats the name of the game volley ball and you struggle to put the ball away
4357374 recent events show we are on the heels of those trying to cheat i expect we will end with a fairly low number of positive cases
4357375 mathematically it will go up to 6 7 8 figures show they are rather encouraging more than anything else
4357376 in the athens 2004 games there were some additional cases this time many federations have conducted intensive out of competition testing

4357378 its the first time ive ever been at a swimming event and i said this cant be normal
4357379 i dont know that well ever see it in our lifetime
4357380 i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4357381 i think you have to be realistic as to how incredible this effort is
4357382 it has to do with his physical ability his ability to race his ability to keep his focus to get excited when he needs to get excited to get down when he needs to get down
4357383 to maintain a high level of performance over two or three olympic games is very very difficult
4357384 if michael sticks around for 2012 its going to set the bar incredibly high
4357385 i dont want to say he does it effortlessly but he does it beautifully
4357386 im not sure ill see another one as good as he in my lifetime
4357387 the impetus to specialize is definitely going to be there
4357388 because if you spread yourself too thin youre probably going to sacrifice your best event
4357389 hes showing a different kind of courage than i did
4357390 i was not chasing mark spitzs record i was chasing swimmer don schollander and jesse owens who each won four golds at a single olympics when i came up with a program of seven it seemed to be almost ridiculously invented by myself
4357391 it definitely never ever gets old listening to the national anthem play
4357392 with all your lies youre still so lovable i toured the light so many foreign roads for emma forever ago
4357393 i send greetings to those celebrating the 62nd anniversary of indias independence
4357394 led by mahatma gandhi the indian people engaged in non violent protests and campaigns in the pursuit of freedom
4357395 on august 15 1947 they achieved their goal gained their independence and became a democratic nation this accomplishment demonstrates that though freedom can be delayed it cannot be denied
4357396 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india
4357397 laura his wife and i send our best wishes on the occasion
4357398 we have nothing to eat the place where we used to sleep we are cooking there and if a vehicle passes by the house it splashes more water into the house the situation is very critical here
4357399 wherever you go the situation is the same in patna it is very difficult for the children it is pathetic
4357400 if not in a few months but in few years the border would just be a drawn line through which the people of both nations would be able to cross without any hesitation or hitch
4357401 though pakistan allows peaceniks up to the gate but dreams of dissolving of borders between india and pakistan would be reality in near future
4357402 there is no safe passage for him now he is asking for safe passage after selling out pakistans sovereignty

4357404 put simply a tabloid and the blogosphere both of which have been ridiculed for years by the msm broke and publicized an immense story regarding a major presidential candidate and potential cabinet member
4357405 do you suppose edwards went to the hotel to see if he could drill himself out of the problem he certainly seems to have drilled himself into it
4357406 anggaran tambahan sebesar rp 46 triliun di tahun 2009 sebagian besar akan disalurkan ke daerah dana itu akan digunakan untuk penuntasan wajib belajar peningkatan kesejahteraan guru baik negeri dan swasta dan untuk meningkatkan mutu smk
4357407 jadi sebenarnya mutu pendidikan selama ini pun sudah meningkat untuk dana ini pola penyalurannya akan dilakukan secara langsung dana akan langsung digunakan oleh sekolah kalau sampai ada yang korupsi ya kita kenakan pidana korupsi
4357408 terutama untuk gaji guru yang berada di bawah diknas saja kira kira bisa menyerap sampai rp 10 triliun untuk kenaikan gaji guru seperti yang disiapkan belum termasuk guru di bawah depag
4357409 dimana subsidi bisa diturunkan dan setelah dihitung hitung cukup menambah rp 46 triliun sudah bisa mencukupi 20 tersebut

4357417 el acuerdo es de dos partes y tambi n de diecisiete porque la propuesta tiene una parte bilateral y otra multilateral
4357418 lo que dice el estatut y lo que dice el texto es que tiene que haber un acuerdo en materia de financiaci n no que el gobierno tenga que hacer esto o lo otro el matiz es importante
4357419 el acuerdo es de dos partes y tambi n de diecisiete porque la propuesta tiene una parte bilateral y otra multilateral
4357420 mejorar n su financiaci n en un modelo que garantice m s autonom a fiscal y m s recursos
4357421 a salir del l o en el que est metido

4357424 al r gimen de tiflis actuar con impunidad y permisividad total
4357425 est dispuesto a recuperar la iniciativa pol tica en el tratamiento del frenazo econ mico
4357426 mejor es tomar iniciativas que quedarse quieto mientras pasa el vendaval
4357427 es este sentido hay que aplaudir el traslado al terreno estrictamente econ mico de la vocaci n reformista de este gobierno pero las propuestas concretas recitadas ayer por el presidente zapatero provocan dudas
4357428 refleja una resistencia a reconocer que sus causas no son s lo ex genas
4357429 la situaci n exige menos agitaci n gestual a la que tanto recurre la oposici n y m s realismo
4357430 el mal es general pero la crisis tiene en espa a causas internas que no se atajaron a tiempo y caracter sticas singulares como el persistente diferencial de inflaci n y el elevad simo d ficit exterior efecto de la p rdida de competitividad las medidas anticrisis deben tener en cuenta esa singularidad y servir para estimular el cambio de modelo de crecimiento
4357431 felicitarse por el hecho de que alemania o francia tengan dificultades es escupir al cielo
4357432 el error al poner el acento en tratar de blindarse de las cr ticas antes que en encontrar verdaderas soluciones a los problemas
4357433 el gobierno ha vuelto a perder otra oportunidad y como gr ficamente se al ayer ciu su plan es en realidad una aspirina para un enfermo grave
4357434 no s lo fracas en su prop sito de transmitir confianza a los ciudadanos ante la crisis econ mica sino que aliment la controversia sobre el futuro modelo de financiaci n auton mica

4357436 simular ahora contundencia para matizar con tecnicismos o rectificar los inadmisibles privilegios financieros que acept en su momento para catalu a genera tanta incredulidad como sus razonamientos para combatir la crisis con seriedad y eficacia
4357437 no ha agotado todo el margen de maniobra que tiene para sacar a espa a de la grave situaci n en que se encuentra y ser a bueno que lo hiciera
4357438 el gobierno podr a haber hecho mucho m s de lo que ha hecho el presidente zapatero no cerr ayer la puerta a nuevas medidas a qu espera pues para adoptarlas mejor ser a actuar antes de que la econom a pudiera entrar en recesi n no estamos en ella pero la rozamos
4357439 zapatero vuelve a vender optimismo para hacer frente a lo que denomina frenazo econ mico
4357440 el optimismo siempre es bueno pero no como receta a una situaci n que afecta a todos los ciudadanos
4357441 no les aporta ninguna soluci n sino que crispa m s sus nimos al comprobar que no se toman medidas eficaces contra la grave situaci n

4357445 aunque es obvio que no se le pueden pedir responsabilidades pol ticas a quien no ejerce ning n cargo p blico no es menos cierto que el ex presidente tiene una deuda moral con su partido y con la sociedad balear si matas no da la cara ser la de rosa estar s la que acabe parando los golpes

4357547 if not in a few months but in few years the border would just be a drawn line through which the people of both nations would be able to cross without any hesitation or hitch

4357549 we have nothing to eat the place where we used to sleep we are cooking there and if a vehicle passes by the house it splashes more water into the house the situation is very critical here
4357550 wherever you go the situation is the same in patna it is very difficult for the children it is pathetic
4357551 theres way more pressure cooking for cooks than rowing at the olympics
4357552 i think the opposite i cant imagine the pressure of sitting in that boat
4357553 this guy comes in lean 6 foot 5 clean cut
4357554 weve had hundreds of interns some good some not this guy is organized disciplined comes in on his own time im impressed but i dont know his background
4357555 after a while i hear kitchen talk about him and the olympics im thinking culinary olympics he looks too young for that but i have to ask were you in the culinary olympics

4357563 anything can happen now there are some tough girls in there so well have to see im very excited

4357565 i didnt expect to win or get a medal i just wanted to go out there and have some fun i am not disappointed because i made the final in the first place
4357566 it is still the fourth fastest i have ever been but im not doing the 200m back again im too old for the training
4357567 i dont know what im going to do i might try some sprinting but 200 back is too much for me now
4357568 i brought myself up from not being in a position beforehand to make the final to making it so you have to take a bonus from that
4357569 im not really happy with how i swam this morning but i gave it my best shot it was a bit hard at the beginning when everyone was cheering as they said take your marks it was a bit of a surreal experience

4357581 my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4357582 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye

4357594 the real issue is nobody wants to pay the full cost of transportation
4357595 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4357596 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4357597 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4357598 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west

4357703 i see nuclear winter coming in terms of the negativity of this campaign
4357704 everything bad that happened bad our reign is the fault of the democrats who were in office before and everything good that happens when a democratic is in the white house is only because of all the things we did
4357705 who is estimating that there is three times the amount of oil here as there is in saudi arabia
4357706 since the 19th century we in the west have been trying to extract oil from the vast oil shale riches that lie under our feet
4357707 we should let them spend billions drilling dry holes and not on areas that actually contain oil

4357709 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
4357710 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
4357711 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
4357712 i mean they made it seem like any coloradan could go and now you have to work for your ticket
4357713 my experience matches what you are hearing from other sources because of my work schedule and other activities going on i did not sign up for the all star tickets but i was called by the campaign and told that i had to volunteer this week in order to get tickets at all i finally agreed to one three hour shift but it left a bad impression for this lifelong democrat i hope someone in the campaign understands that they are turning off volunteers with their aggressive and disorganized approach
4357714 the problem got worse today when i got three phone calls from three different people at the obama campaign office asking me to bring food for the staff i had signed up to donate snacks but i didnt realize i was supposed to feed the whole staff just thought youd want to know that the problem goes way beyond just the confusion about the tickets i have no idea how obama can win colorado when the campaign office is such a disaster

4357734 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
4357735 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
4357736 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

4357738 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
4357739 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4357740 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4357741 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4357742 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4357743 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4357744 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4357745 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4357747 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4357748 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4357749 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4357750 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4357751 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4357752 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4357753 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4357760 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4357761 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4357762 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4357764 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4357765 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4357766 there were only very few artists of that calibre then
4357767 there are collectors who keep these works of art in bank vaults but it is likely that well find others
4357768 we know of artworks that have been documented and that we havent found yet
4357769 a full review of the facts is in process so that we and the family may have a clear picture of the circumstances surrounding this tragic and extraordinary event
4357770 they came here and i guess they told him to take gatorade and just left him
4357771 i just came from football practice and i think i need an iv or something i think im just dehydrated and need an iv
4357772 dehydration may have played a role in his death but this is not certain nor even that he was dehydrated
4357773 he was biting my legs he bit on his mouthpiece
4357774 any time a 17 year old whos apparently ok dies after theyve been seen by some kind of medical personnel you wonder if anything could have been done differently
4357775 i think we owe that explanation to the family and we owe it to people who call 911
4357776 i am so angry and so mad and have so much hate in my heart that i cant vent like i want to
4357777 its all because of a number that you deemed him mentally retarded
4357778 mental retardation is not an excuse for what he did it is not a defense to what he did it did not cause him to commit this crime
4357779 dont put the skinny guy at the refreshment table people will assume the snacks arent that good
4357780 if you dont hold members accountable for what you asked them to sign god will hold you accountable
4357781 seriously if youre a church leader not learning from nelson youre missing out on a gold mine of information im thankful for opportunities to learn from other guys who are getting it done and i feel like i learned a ton today
4357782 wenn externe dienstleister im rahmen einer t tigkeit f r bayer zu illegalen mitteln gegriffen haben sollten so w re dies ohne kenntnis und billigung des unternehmens geschehen
4357783 ohne old boys l uft gar nichts in der branche auch nicht in deutschland in angels chsischen l ndern ist die zusammenarbeit zwischen staat und wirtschaft allerdings viel ausgepr gter da werden richtig die hosen runtergelassen
4357784 einige firmen machen einfach alles um sich vorteile zu verschaffen
4357785 ein einblick in derartige aktivit ten ist gef hrliche munition
4357786 es ist eine g ngige methode berufsanf nger in fremde unternehmen einzuschleusen um konkurrenzspionage zu betreiben
4357787 bei der revision von telekommunikationsanlagen werden wir immer wieder f ndig der aberglaube dass wir in einer globalisierten welt mit zunehmendem wettbewerb nur von freuden umgeben sein sollen ist geradezu drollig
4357788 ausl ndische unternehmen betreiben industriespionage zum teil mit der unterst tzung staatlicher stellen
4357789 eine derartige zusammenarbeit ist insbesondere in l ndern blich in denen der staat ma geblichen einfluss auf unternehmen hat dazu geh ren die ehemaligen kommunistischen staaten
4357790 aber auch in einigen westlichen l ndern liegt es im nationalen interesse informationen zu beschaffen damit die unternehmen im internationalen wettbewerb bestehen k nnen das gilt vor allem wenn der staat an gro en konzernen beteiligt ist
4357791 in russland und der ukraine sind die dienste gesetzlich verpflichtet die wirtschaft ihres landes zu unterst tzen
4357792 je gr er ein unternehmen ist desto interessanter ist es f r den nachrichtendienst
4357793 stellen sie sich vor bei einer anbahnung kommt es zu einem leichten verkehrsunfall die zielperson sitzt bei dem getarnten agenten in einem teuren angemieteten auto jetzt kommt ein dorfpolizist und stellt fest dass es sich um einen leihwagen handelt die tarnung fliegt auf
4357794 bei der legendierung muss alles bis ins kleinste detail stimmen
4357795 das gro unternehmen muss weltweit aufgestellt sein an internationalen brennpunkten starke interessen haben und von daher auch wissenstr ger sein zudem muss es ber einen eigenen security bereich mit zust ndigkeit f r in und ausland verf gen
4357796 allerdings hat die wirtschaft ein starkes eigenschutzinteresse und ist sicher nicht bereit die verantwortung f r die eigene sicherheit vollumf nglich an den staat abzutreten
4357797 die firmen entscheiden sich lieber f r eine interne aufkl rung mit hilfe von profis wenn die ermittlungen zu unappetitlichen ergebnissen f hren kann man ein sicherheitsunternehmen noch stoppen staatliche ermittler nicht
4357798 sicherheitsberatungen haben zugang zu den sensibelsten daten eines unternehmens da darf man keine hinterhofdetektive beauftragen
4357799 i was playing first 15 for the school and i wasnt getting game time i was getting like 10 minutes a game and one of my mates asked if i wanted to play in his team
4357800 i just went along and started playing and then got asked to trial for the wellington league team and made it and from there it was all go
4357801 i never thought sets of six were planned up i thought it was everyone doing whatever they want
4357802 that was the hardest bit along with getting back 10m on defence
4357803 i was aiming for it but i didnt think i would make it i didnt even think i would get a starting spot for the under 20s and luckily there were a couple of injuries that got me a starting spot
4357804 when i first came up i was way overweight and way unfit and the pre season did me real good
4357805 i was willing to learn off players and how they run their lives like ruben wiki and steve price and logan swann
4357806 i think ivans slowly building a lot of faith in me which is pretty good for me to get more minutes
4357807 ive seen him play quite a lot and i played against him on my debut match hes a hard guy to tackle
4357808 theyve got players like brett kimmorley paul gallen greg bird theyve got a couple of big hard running centres and they kick well and finish their sets well all the things that we try and do really
4357809 a lot happens around gallen and bird and theyve got a good player at fullback whos in good form in brett kearney
4357810 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4357811 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4357812 it was a good place to be mentally to think that i had a chance
4357813 he had an uncommon sense of devotion to this place there were no limits on his hours and dedication he lived the work
4357814 i sided with the students basically and it was a wonderful thing that the chief administrative officer of the campus was going against the trustees wishes on a matter of principle
4357815 we have extreme problems in the west but at least the message is getting out
4357816 were definitely in a little better shape than last year
4357817 even if we were to get a repeat of last year the fact that were starting off with 90 percent of supply is going to help
4357818 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4357819 im all for winning by as much as we can
4357820 but dont confuse our margin of victory with an easy win
4357821 the current value of risk to farmers is almost double our annual premium and thats not tenable
4357822 were not allowed to charge customers for those costs so it all comes out of company reserves
4357823 it just so happens that my family and i ran into abercrombie amp fitch not victorias secret that day
4357824 the album title is perfect life death love and freedom
4357825 if you listen to jimmie rodgers hank williams woody guthrie those were traditional topics in american folk songs the songs are about the parts of life that most people dont really want to discuss
4357826 which doesnt necessarily work for pop music that record companies really want to put out i made this album for me
4357827 i dont think people like the idea that i did that
4357828 people are mad at us because wre too liberal i have more friends in new york than i have here but some of the people i like the most live here
4357829 when people come up and scream things at you and your kids on the playground or leave nasty notes on your windshield it is irritating
4357830 i have known for some time that i was at odds with my surroundings politically speaking
4357831 fascism is something like when government and big business control policy making and were there baby
4357832 before it didnt matter that i was a little left
4357833 gas was 1 85 a gallon and people werent getting killed and the housing market was booming
4357834 and they probably still are pissed at me my ticket sales album sales everything i do i m paying a price for that
4357835 the album title is perfect life death love and freedom
4357836 if you listen to jimmie rodgers hank williams woody guthrie those were traditional topics in american folk songs the songs are about the parts of life that most people dont really want to discuss

4357857 its not quite three roles but equal to three roles ranbir has to play age 16 age 24 and finally 30 while the middle part is close to the way he is in body language and speech playing age 16 and 30 is not easy not for ranbir who ive discovered is a bit of a perfectionist
4357858 youve to see how ranbir looks in the three phases of his roles he has different clothes hair and styling in every phase but most important is the way he has used the voice he has brought different nuances and different speech patterns for each phase in his characters life for age 16 he speaks faster and in a shrill tone when youre younger youre more enthusiastic and eager to be heard ranbir looks and sounds as exuberant and restless as a 16 year old and at 30 though theres no discernible difference in a persons voice quality youve to hear the differences ranbir has brought into his voice
4357859 thats the kind of actor he is ive never seen such a hunger for perfection in any actor that age
4357860 bipasha whos professionally senior to ranbir looks so well matched with ranbir all those who think the two would be mismatched better be ready for a shock ranbir can look compatible with any co star

4357863 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structure that the public can feel reassured about
4357864 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4357865 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4357866 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
4357867 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area there is still a lot of recovery work going on and there are obvious long term infrastructural problems we hope to be able to visit the town of beichuan which was decimated by the earthquake but this will depend very much on the local authorities were very thankful to the sichuan provincial government for granting us access to the earthquake zone at such a critical time the location of the active faults is crucial we want to see if the faults that weve previously mapped were activated during the earthquake or if the quake occurred along a new set of faults knowing where the active faults lie and how much they are likely to move in future events can help the chinese authorities in planning new buildings and towns to reduce the likelihood of future casualties

4357870 apa yang dilakukan maria sudah maksimal ini prestasi tertinggi dia apalagi dia merupakan satu satunya pemain puteri di luar china yang masuk semifinal olimpiade
4357871 di babak sebelumnya maria mengalahkan pemain denmark tine rasmussen pemain denmark inilah yang sebenarnya sangat ditakuti kubu china
4357872 saya rasa ia telah mencapai tahap di mana ia sudah bisa mengukur bagaimana menghadapi lawan lawan yang berbeda
4357873 nanti ia akan mencapai tahap bisa membawa lawannya mengikuti gaya permainannya
4357874 yang saya lihat maria ini mentalnya bagus tidak takut kalah dia harus membuat dukungan penonton justru akan menjadi tekanan buat pemain china itu

4357888 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4357889 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4357890 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4357891 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4357892 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4357893 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere

4357898 i know that he is from hawaii he grew up there his grandmother lives there but hes made such a point about how he is from kansas and you know the boy from kansas and kenya and it makes him seem a little bit more exotic than perhaps he would want to come across as at this stage in the presidential campaign

4357904 while on my vista kick here and here i need to respond to several important errors of understanding in the recent press release hailed with a
4357905 governor timothy m kaine today announced an online resource especially designed for seniors and adults with disabilities
4357906 we appreciate the support of the community and we appreciate the support of the other involved agencies i think weve had great successes we just felt it was time to give somebody else a turn
4357907 the reason pasco has been willing to do it for so long and the reason why im willing to do it is because its good for all of us
4357908 it doesnt matter if you arrest a criminal in pasco or rural benton county theyre selling and dealing drugs throughout the community

4357912 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4357913 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

4357919 i suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend as applications for new mortgages the most important series have flattened out i dont know but i think the worst of this may well be over
4357920 the drop in u s home prices will probably end well before early next year as the number of houses on the market diminishes aiding an economic rebound
4357921 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4357922 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4357923 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
4357924 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
4357925 at 82 years old mr greenspan remains sharp and his fascination with the workings of the economy undiminished but his star no longer shines as brightly as it did when he retired from the fed in january 2006
4357926 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
4357927 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
4357928 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4357929 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units

4357934 hey dudes women playing sport its not about your cocks
4357935 heheh beach volleyball hehe hi five hot chicks for us shall we wank to a porn video later
4357936 we would not have much time to campaign for the election as we are in a mourning period because of the loss of bakassi
4357937 we had a seven day mourning period before the handover and we will have another seven day mourning period after todays handover
4357938 although some of the buildings have been completed one would have expected that the entire project would have been completed by now
4357939 the gains of this action which are in pursuit of international peace good neighbourliness and rule of law may in the final analysis outweigh the painful losses in territory ancestral homes and other emotions too numerous to mention
4357940 equally proof to the world of the ability of our two countries to respect their international commitments in this commitment cameroun reiterates her determination to abide by her commitments taken within the framework of the green tree agreement as concerns the special transitional regime applied to the zone for a non renewable period of five years
4357941 with his successive nigerian counterpart and with the assistance of the successive secretary general of the united nations deserves i believe to be hailed by both peoples and acknowledged by the international community we have no doubt that other voices will join ours to exalt this exemplary success
4357942 i am deeply honoured to be part of this historic achievement a true triumph of international law here on the continent neighbourly cooperation and the brotherly approach of the two parties have been fundamental in realising a peaceful culmination of the transition in bakassi this ceremony marks yet another milestone in the cooperation between cameroun and nigeria
4357943 for the united nations the green tree agreement was also the embodiment of an innovative approach to conflict resolution beginning with the withdrawal of nigerian troops from bakassi two years ago and culminating in this ceremony the case of the bakassi peninsula has proven the viability of a peaceful and legal settlement of border disputes when it is done with the full support of the international community and in the spirit of mutual respect good neighbourliness and cooperation
4357944 permit me at this point to draw attention to the green tree agreement which spelt out modalities for the transfer of bakassi to cameroun
4357945 among other things the agreement provides that nigerians are free to remain in the peninsula if they choose to do so even after its transfer to cameroun
4357946 specifically article 3 of the agreement provides that cameroun shall a not force nigerian nationals living in bakassi peninsula to leave the zone or to change their nationality b respect their culture language and beliefs c respect their right to continue their agricultural and fishing activities d protect their property and their customary rights e not levy in any discriminatory manner any taxes and other dues on nigerians living in the zone and f take every necessary measures to protect nigerian national living in the zone from any harassment or harm
4357947 we call on nigerian nationals who have chosen to remain in bakassi to be conscious of these rights even as the federal government of nigeria continues to ensure that the rights of these nigerians are not abused
4357948 let me equally say here that the task of resettling the displaced people of bakassi who have chosen to move away from the area in their determination to remain part of their fatherland is indeed enormous
4357949 this is where the international community also has a big role to play not only in assisting with the provision of funds but by helping in other ways to re assure the displaced people that they remain accepted members of the world community even with the support of the federal government we cannot do too much for these people who have to start their lives anew for no fault of theirs
4357950 one of the key issues and i know one of the most interesting issues to most people is the issue of bakassi we looked at the issues and we noted what has been done and all the states that might likely have problems because of movement of people and we told them to monitor the situation the states include imo bayelsa cross river akwa ibom and rivers they have all started doing so many things but at least they have been alerted further today yesterday so that we will be able to do what we can to alleviate the suffering of those who will be moving from bakassi we are more concern about the human angle and these particular governors have been mandated to go the extra mile extra to ensure that the sufferings are alleviated
4357951 i think the experience of taking part in three olympics helped
4357952 if phelps wins 7 golds and doesnt set world records in each event will the feat still match spitz
4357953 i dont think theres anybody in that building that thinks he cant win eight

4357955 against the might of the bn machinery but it will be the voters who will mark
4357956 i dont care who the bn candidate is i have no quarrel with ariff shah if he wants to contest that is his right
4357957 sings so they say pakatan rakyat will have to work equally hard to maintain the seat as time and time again its the x in the ballot boxes which determines who wins or loses we say the people of permatang pauh will surely win be ready for another
4357958 when all other means has been exausted it is rightious to draw the sword of justice the peoples power
4357959 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time

4357962 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4357963 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4357964 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4357965 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4357966 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4357967 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4357968 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe

4357981 up to the point of what occurred at the campground
4357982 i wanted to go because the wars in iraq and afghanistan are the most important american stories happening right now
4357983 a lot of people over there are roughly my age i want to see what theyre doing
4357984 seeing what the troops there sacrificed and what they were going through to recover really brought home the cost of war
4357985 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away miss clark said after her guide former nuclear physicist gottlieb otto braun elwert 59 collapsed from an apparent heart attack
4357986 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in an emotional miss clark said
4357987 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow miss clark said
4357988 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beautiful trips with him miss clark said
4357989 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours mr crow said
4357990 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4357991 she miss clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo said ann braun elwert
4357992 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4357993 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else mr braun elwert said in an interview in 2000
4357994 but other retailers should be able to absorb some of the spending that went to mervyns and that should add strength to their balance sheets
4357995 it was not a top end store or lower end store
4357996 theres nobody here but then theres nobody anywhere these days is there
4357997 you can take your bowling ball and roll it down the aisle and youre not going to hit anybody

4358007 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing he said in a statement
4358008 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4358009 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase he said
4358010 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4358011 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again

4358028 the relay was behind me so i just eased into it without feeling too much pressure
4358029 i wasnt expecting a medal i just focused on myself and sometimes the outcome is not what you expect
4358030 i was ninth after the semi finals i was out of the final so to get put in and come away with a silver is awesome

4358047 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory

4358054 i have those feelings every night when this team takes the field tonights the night the wind was blowing in that night four years ago tonight it was nice and cool after the rain and the ball was flying and they just made better plays than we did

4358093 the truth was i wrestled with what it meant and how much weight i should have given to those problems with the catholic kids
4358094 how much weight do we give to things that are happening now
4358095 it has certainly been really enlightening to have so much interfaith dialogue
4358096 understand and appreciate the interwoven history of both of our faiths
4358097 why dont you start talking about what we have in common
4358098 the u s catechism tells us that this is the fabric of our own identity threads that are woven together through the fabric of our common heritage
4358099 he wanted to have a meeting with interfaith leaders he also carved out a meeting that would just be with jewish leadership
4358100 we are at a point where we can recognize the tragedy of the holocaust and move into another understanding this helps build that sense of commonality in our humanity
4358101 were not just victims but they went on to flourish
4358102 the toll being inflicted on web advertising by the slowing economy

4358104 lodging an expression of interest however keeps aru in the ball park while assessing what would clearly be a daunting financial challenge
4358105 keeping the eastern end of the runway open for take offs will ensure that residents in the north north west and south of the airport do not bear the full burden of aircraft noise during construction
4358106 i believe that people in the sydney community are tolerant but there is a limit to their tolerance and they expect governments will do everything in their power to minimise disruption to their lives and that is what we are doing

4358142 kalau begitu kita janji ya untuk sama sama berusaha untuk menjadi pemain basket masional
4358143 itu dia alasannya kenapa aku merasa bahwa aku harus terus bermain basket hingga menjadi pemain nasional aku selalu merasa itu sebuah janji yang harus ditepati namun aku tidak tau berjanji kepada siapa
4358144 seorang pria dinilai dari janjinya janji itu harus kamu tepati cucuku
4358145 iya kek tapi kenapa andre tidak menepati janjinya dimana dia sekarang
4358146 sebaiknya kamu lihat lagi mereka berdua pertanyaan kamu akan terjawab setelah itu
4358147 menangislah cucuku menangislah hingga hatimu merasa lega itulah gunanya air mata untuk mengalirkan duka di hati
4358148 setelah kejadian itu rupanya kamu tidak bisa menerimanya kamu masih terlalu kecil untuk bisa menerima kejadian menyedihkan itu kamu menjadi pemurung mengurung diri di dalam kamar tidak mau makan dan susah untuk tidur kakek menemanimu setiap hari
4358149 kakek sedih sekali saat itu kakek tidak kuat melihatmu seperti itu akhirnya kakek memohon kepada yang maha kuasa agar kamu bisa melupakan kejadian itu rupanya doa kakek terkabul entah bagaimana tepat satu hari sebelum kamu masuk sd tiba tiba kamu lupa akan semua kejadian sebelumnya terutama tentang andre begitulah cucuku

4358173 i was chasing someone named don schollander and jessie owens who had four gold medals when i came up with a program for seven gold medals it came to be almost ridiculously invented by myself i had a lot of naysayers
4358174 we sincerely apologize for the error that resulted in fenway park being unavailable to host the 2009 acc baseball championship
4358175 the atlantic coast conference and its baseball championship are very important to us and we are truly sorry for this situation
4358176 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
4358177 ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mom and everybody who needs me back in australia and it just feels like its worthwhile
4358178 it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain ive got to thank tad and jodi geschickter team owners for plucking me out of nowhere i met them at a hot dusty day at indianapolis i was hanging around like a bad smell until they gave me a test and here we are
4358179 i feel like were ready to really do something special
4358180 i was pretty used to winning down home i was a two time champion and won a lot of races so you had to eat a little humble pie when i came here and just learn the craft
4358181 its a very different discipline nascar racing even on a road course
4358182 its an odd situation but it was that way last year and its that way again this year
4358183 this defensive line has to be the biggest and most athletic group ive had as a coach
4358184 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4358185 im all for winning by as much as we can
4358186 but dont confuse our margin of victory with an easy win
4358187 the herald and mcclatchy continue to manage through an economic downturn that is having an unprecedented negative effect on revenues and therefore our financial health
4358188 while we have taken many steps to reorganize and streamline operations to respond to changing business models and these economic challenges we need to do more to control expenses
4358189 as an important part of that effort we are implementing an across the board one year wage freeze effective september 1 2008
4358190 this means that if you are scheduled to receive a merit or salary review between september 1 2008 and august 31 2009 your review will occur one year later than scheduled for example if your next salary review date is march 1 2009 the salary review will be postponed until march 1 2010 you will however receive regularly scheduled performance reviews during this period
4358191 we believe the ncaa has treated ben differently than it has other athletes with very very similar circumstances
4358192 the facts are that he only got to play three years
4358193 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
4358194 despite being a model student athlete and person for the ncaa and despite having earned the ncaa significant revenues the ncaa has wrongfully arbitrarily and capriciously denied mr mauks request to participate in a fourth year of athletic competition for reasons completely beyond mr mauks control
4358195 we look forward to explaining more fully our reasons for the decision and the careful review given not only by our staff but also by representatives from our member schools
4358196 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4358197 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4358198 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4358199 it was a good place to be mentally to think that i had a chance
4358200 we competed in two events and came home with two medals each
4358201 well i wish it would have been two golds for me but based on our individual results there is a lot more pressure on us i think we were feeling that today we werent really prepared for ukraine but we were ready for this match against france
4358202 all the advances theyve made are really positive for our sport
4358203 with the wireless and the lights in the mask it makes it a lot cooler to watch and to be able to see peoples expressions when the camera is on them makes it more interesting
4358204 and on television theyre able to show it in slow motion which also helps because it moves so fast when its in real time they can see the action a lot better
4358205 i thought this was our absolute best shot to get it our team has never been stronger
4358206 we had an incredible season and to not fence up to our potential was so disappointing to me
4358207 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4358208 i decided that i had come this far and didnt want to let them down so i wrestled
4358209 certainly one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4358210 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4358211 but one way is to make sure that employees hear it from you first
4358212 if we find out that austin does not bring in the value or if we dont find the right buyer we will continue to operate it
4358213 this is a fairly remarkable streak when the guys are all playing well like this you have this feeling that you can always come back we definitely feel like were going to win when its close in the seventh
4358214 when weve won weve always pitched well when youre playing like were playing you start to feel a little invincible
4358215 berkman is one of the best hitters in the national league
4358216 his numbers speak for themselves when i got him out two nights ago i went away from him and with fastballs in
4358217 today i went away from him but i figured i would try to go in on him again and he was sitting on it i just caught too much of the plate and he hit it pretty good
4358218 we couldnt get anyone hot out there thats what it comes down to we got the lead we did what we wanted to do out there
4358219 he hinshaw made a mistake he threw one right down the middle which is not what we want him to do in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt have gotten a pitch like that but he did
4358220 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4358221 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4358222 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4358223 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4358224 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4358225 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4358226 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4358227 it was a great day it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4358228 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4358229 theres a half dozen to a dozen news entities that are growing into global shoes
4358230 they came to the right decision but they came to it slowly
4358231 that is money that could have saved some of those jobs
4358232 what were seeing is the systematic dismantling of one of the nations top newspaper companies the idea of bringing in new blood to the newspaper industry isnt a bad one because i think in a number of ways it does have old ways of thinking but when you bring in new blood those people have to bring in new strategies cutting pages and jobs isnt a strategy its just a way to cut costs which all newspaper companies are doing
4358233 what happens in five years if it looks like more of the recruitment is coming through yahoos hotjobs said outsells doctor
4358234 the core strength of a newspaper is its sales staff and its relationship to the advertiser said doctor
4358235 if they can keep that relationship it doesnt matter what they are selling
4358236 the synergies are real here if you put together the list of advertising clients cablevision has with the list of accounts newsday has and the combined contacts the sales teams have thats significant
4358237 ive been skeptical but this really is a tremendous opportunity for them
4358238 this is a permanent downsizing of newspaper companies said ken doctor
4358239 theyre not using the word permanent but its a recognition that they will get much smaller as they try to find their way in a digital world
4358240 its the end of the world as we know it
4358241 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4358242 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4358243 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was

4358376 some decry the professional role of politics they would like to see it disappear
4358377 some argue political professionals are ruining american politics trapping candidates in daily competition for the news cycle instead of long term strategic thinking in the best interest of the country
4358378 its odd to me that most of these critics are journalists and columnists
4358379 perhaps they dont like sharing the field of play perhaps they want to draw attention away from the corrosive role their coverage has played focusing attention on process and not substance
4358380 there are some in politics who hold that voters are dumb ill informed and easily misled that voters can be manipulated by a clever ad or a smart mind
4358381 ive seen this cynicism over the years from political professionals and journalists american people are not policy wonks but they have great instincts and try to do the right thing

4358393 we genuinely acquired this land because it was a donation to the presidency
4358394 some of the local people in the area later took the matter to the tribunal claiming that it was a public grazing area but we have appealed to the high court
4358395 this land belongs to us and we are free to use it as we want because it was donated to the presidency however mr chairman this matter is before court and i dont know whether it will not be prejudice for us to discuss this issue
4358396 this land was given to the presidency long before there was anything to do with oil there
4358397 has no record whatsoever of land donated to the president
4358398 glad to hear from mr odoi to satisfy to us where they got that land
4358399 the local councils have never had ownership of that land
4358400 it is public land and the council has nothing to do with allocation of land
4358401 there is however no evidence that this land was surveyed and registered
4358402 besides a letter from lc 1 of that area states that this land was sold off by someone from masindi i am not aware what action is being taken to secure this land
4358403 its inappropriate for state house to pursue this land yet president museveni is fighting for the landless this land should be left to the local people since the government interest is to empower them to benefit from bonna bagagawale prosperity for all by using land as a factor of production

4358508 warm up 800 mixer on 10 30 4x150 kick on 2 30 50 stroke 50 free 50 stroke 400 pull with buoy on 5 00 breathe 3 5 7 9 by 100 200 stroke on 3 00 10x50 on 45 2 25kick 25drill 2 25free 25stroke 1 stroke main set 4x50 on 1 30 1x50 1 20 1x50 1 10 1x50 1 00 1x50 0 50 1x50 0 40 1x50 0 30 long swim down 100 200 300 pull lungbusters by quarters 400 choice kick 300 200 100 im drills
4358509 say hes doing about four miles a session and a couple of sessions a day
4358510 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4358511 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4358512 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4358513 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4358514 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4358515 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4358516 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4358517 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fibre maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4358518 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4358519 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4358520 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4358521 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case
4358522 the average person is going to burn about 400 calories
4358523 we have the rest of our lives to spend together if you would just call me fucker
4358524 you did a fine job last night keep it up
4358525 they must not know we are here today you should show a little leg
4358526 im going to lunch you can have this ill be back in an hour or so it looked good this morning
4358527 thanks i worked so hard that i almost forgot about seeing the most beautiful girl in the world
4358528 you are my stalker you are my fear you are my tiny little artist going nowhere you have the ambition of a dead leaf with the drive of a space shuttle you are always on the run with a dead watch
4358529 you are my ceiling fan twirling around to give me a breeze while i am alone on my bed you are my drunkenness you are a dream i am startled from and try to get back to you are my money my gas my aching to be a better person you are the reason i want to clean construct and build a massive pile of things that people will eventually eat you are the reason that i want to throw the bad things out and leave the good
4358530 all the trees of the field will clap their hands
4358531 i dont know you but if i were rich i would quit my job and just spend all day buying you stuff and preparing your dinner and washing your laundry and picking out the perfect flowers for you

4358534 run on back there then or from the looks of you maybe you dont run
4358535 a variety of friends if you are going to try and rebel it most likely wont work
4358536 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4358537 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4358538 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4358539 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4358540 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4358541 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4358542 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4358543 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4358544 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4358545 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4358546 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4358547 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4358548 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4358549 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4358550 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4358551 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4358552 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4358553 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4358554 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4358555 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4358556 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4358557 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4358558 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4358559 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4358560 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4358561 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4358562 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4358563 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4358564 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4358565 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4358566 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4358567 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4358568 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4358576 de que s r voy a hablar en este texto
4358577 miren tengo un lunar en la linea del ojo q te delineas
4358578 so let me get this straight cuddling equals masturbation and supportive equals drunk
4358579 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4358580 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4358581 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4358582 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4358583 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4358584 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4358585 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4358586 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4358587 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4358588 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4358589 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4358590 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4358591 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4358592 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4358593 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4358594 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4358595 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4358596 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4358597 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4358598 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4358599 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4358600 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4358601 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4358602 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4358603 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4358604 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4358605 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4358606 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4358607 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4358608 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4358609 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4358622 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
4358623 on matter of due process when petition is filed against the law provides that the other party should be given the right to be heard the government is like any other ordinary citizen who should be given the chance to be heard which is missing on this case
4358624 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
4358625 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4358626 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it

4358673 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4358674 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4358675 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect
4358676 he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4358677 positionally weve obviously got some ideas about him playing in the back three but theres no reason why he couldnt play elsewhere
4358678 if i knew the difference i would have made the adjustment right away
4358679 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year where he was really dominating
4358680 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding the main thing was he could throw it for strikes early in the count
4358681 kuroda was mixing it up throwing sliders and curveballs mixed his fastball in and changed speeds on his fastball trying to keep hitters off balance
4358682 its tough man weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before
4358683 i believe i can do it i never thought i couldnt
4358684 when i went to first it didnt have anything to do with playing short for me short is just familiar
4358685 myers definitely was up to the task but their pitcher was good too
4358686 were all right i mean were a game back if you had asked me if i would take being a game back with 41 to play i would have said yes so theres no sense in us getting all bent out of shape

4358688 this was found in kims system i interpret that it was a deliberate intake because of the importance it has in that sport the consequences are obvious
4358689 the evidence shows we are ahead of the cheats my interpretation is that three positive tests is fairly low
4358690 you would expect six or seven tests this is a feature of increased awareness in the sports population the figures are encouraging rather than showing anything else
4358691 i dont think officials should enter into speculation like that and unfairly question the achievements of athletes in beijing
4358692 it is not fair particularly from people who have official positions in national teams
4358693 if i knew the difference i would have made the adjustment right away
4358694 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year where he was really dominating
4358695 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding the main thing was he could throw it for strikes early in the count

4358815 theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4358816 unfortunately there are those who have issues with race on a fundamental level
4358817 what the mayor does by his own behavior is play out all these negative stereotypes making it easier for people to try to tie obama to kilpatrick and his behavior
4358818 this is their opportunity to indict an entire people for the very public foibles of a few
4358819 to stand there and praise mayor kilpatrick as a great mayor who is to be emulated all across the country is kind of laughable

4358866 but while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything that hurts growth
4358867 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 percent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4358868 there is a new dynamism in our railways new roads are being built many new seaports and airports are being developed
4358869 irrigation watershed development rain fed areas development flood management all received special attention our effort at increasing investment in the rural areas and reducing debt burden of farmers has turned our farm economy around

4358935 there is no one better and we are looking forward to a long business relationship with such an outstanding company
4358936 the structures of the compounds made by electric discharge differ from those formed by uv photolysis so the hydrolysis time could be very different some of the photochemical products when uv light is used are hydrocarbons that do not react with water
4358937 was meant to mimic charged particle interactions which dr ferris admits is a process at work on titan
4358938 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4358939 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4358940 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts
4358941 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
4358942 if you can find things that explode you can also find things that move but you need different tools to look for them
4358943 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
4358944 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
4358945 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
4358946 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
4358947 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
4358948 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed
4358949 even with segue we are still only mapping a small fraction of the galaxy
4358950 so 14 streams in our data implies a huge number when we extrapolate to the rest of the milky way
4358951 in the center of the galaxy these stellar strands crowd together and you just see a smooth mix of stars
4358952 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits by looking at faint features kevin may be finding some of the angel hair that came from smaller dwarfs or ones that were destroyed longer ago
4358953 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the galaxy and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies
4358954 part of what we see toward virgo is a tidal arm of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy whose main body lies on the opposite side of the milky way but we dont know the origin of the other structures there really arent enough pasta varieties to describe all the structures we find
4358955 we expect that the number of dark matter clumps is much larger than that so something must prevent the smaller clumps from gathering gas and forming stars
4358956 i think the internal dynamics of these tiny galaxies may be hard to explain with our conventional ideas about dark matter
4358957 the sdss has taught us a huge amount about the milky way and its neighbors
4358958 but were still just beginning to map the galaxy in a comprehensive way and theres a trove of discoveries out there for the next generation of surveys including the two new milky way surveys that will be carried out in sdss iii
4358959 we are honored nasa selected the lifepak 1000 defibrillator to protect the lives of crew members onboard the international space station
4358960 the 1000 is used by thousands of emergency responders worldwide and was designed for use in the harshest environments and situations its proven to be one of the most reliable products physio control has ever developed this space first is especially exciting for us as it underscores the many reasons customers choose lifepak defibrillators for emergency medical use
4358961 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4358962 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4358963 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4358964 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4358965 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4358966 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4358967 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4358968 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4358969 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4358970 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
4358971 for the first time we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits
4358972 over geologic time the eruptions have clearly moved up and down the lengths of the tiger stripes

4358978 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4358979 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4358980 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4358981 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4358982 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4358983 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4358985 obama is having difficulty seizing control of a party whose nomination he won fair and square
4358986 from across the nation people have signed affidavits and provided video documentation detailing their experiences of intimidation threats slashed tires unidentified voters being bussing in to caucus events moderators who by law must be impartial wearing obama buttons and throwing out hillary ballots no checking of identification
4358987 the more i delved into research the more data i gathered and the more people i corresponded and spoke with nationwide i couldnt help but realize how profoundly their stories echoed one anothers
4358988 if you want to categorize me as an typical disgruntled hillary supporter
4358989 you are certainly entitled to your opinion in response i suggest you look up
4358990 the no obama movement is a truly large coalition mostly formed by those who feel their party has disenfranchised them and jettisoned its core beliefs these voters differ in many aspects including what they will do in november but one thing is certain they are united in their conviction that the candidate with questionable judgment never mind the least experience was illegally foisted upon them by a party that chose to look the other way without a fair election process we have no democracy and thats precisely why obama is having trouble seizing control it has nothing to do with the clintons
4358991 read this this is a fact today barack obama is subject to what is probably the greatest concentrated attacks of smears lies and innuendo in the lifetime of anyone who reads these words
4358992 you can report smears when you see them to keep us on track on what the smear machine is up to at every moment

4359058 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4359059 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4359060 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4359061 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4359062 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays

4359080 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4359081 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4359082 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4359083 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted

4359141 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy

4359158 excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
4359159 resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people
4359160 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4359161 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4359162 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4359163 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4359164 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end violence against innocent kashmiris

4359179 middle ear nerve damage may play a role in affecting taste in children with recurrent ear infections or chronic ear disease who get drainage tubes this damage may increase intake of fattening foods
4359180 there was a trend but not significant for recurrent ear infection to lead to overweight
4359181 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4359182 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4359183 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4359184 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4359185 a tonsillectomy may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4359186 the facts alleged in the parking or compliance violation notice are inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was violated

4359211 its definitely weird its going to be weird playing against javon walker in the season opener but thats the way this league is
4359212 now john lynchs request to be released early in training camp seems strange lynch said he was unhappy with his role but he probably wont have more than part time status with the patriots
4359213 the scene is well noted for its dangerousness and uniqueness
4359214 in july fixed asset investment again accelerated to a certain extent

4359217 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4359218 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4359219 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4359220 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4359221 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4359222 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4359223 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4359224 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4359225 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4359301 it has been estimated that by the time the average american reaches the age of 65 he or she will have been exposed to approximately 136 692 500 ads of various forms and will have watched over 2 million television commercials
4359302 the number of messages hitting our brain in 2007 soared to an astonishing 5000 per day 2007 also saw millions of people making the breakthrough connection between advertising and their own mental health
4359303 the problem i have with advertising is not the fact that it exists but that its distracting the ratio of messages that benefit advertisers to the ratio that benefit us is wildly unfavorable to us in fact the ratio is not just unfavorable its a shut out
4359304 my gripe is with how much mind space it all consumes and how distracting that is from other quieter deeply important agendas we may have for our own lives tbyb is interested in taking back some of that bandwidth for ourselves in reclaiming our attention from the seductions of those mental predators so that we may use it to achieve our own goals
4359305 i had conceived of buying an rv as a possible solution to achieve some really important objectives about health recreation and connection what i think the ad campaign did was keep that gestalt of priorities solution in my consciousness or rather it kept returning my attention to that gestalt in spite of many competing distractions over many months the ads kept nudging me with reminders about the goal of owning an rv which in turn prompted me to take the many small actions that finally led to its realization

4359322 nothing has seriously been done about it there isnt an economic reason for business to invest in ipv6 because everything is working at the moment
4359323 my personal view is that we are going to see very lucrative markets for ipv4 addresses the world is addicted to it and business will pay almost any price to get addresses
4359324 its like running out of phone numbers the phone book will still be used because everyone with a number will still be active
4359325 i think were all screwed there is some really critical resources that will run out in less than two years that we need for each user to have a decent internet experience
4359326 many time estimates dont account for the land grab thats going to occur when users realise address space is running out
4359327 they dont see a problem with their internet access so why would they pay more for ipv6 which will essentially deliver the same service

4359354 post race i plan to eat sleep and hydrate well in order to better recover

4359849 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4359850 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4359851 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4359852 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4359853 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4359854 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4359855 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4359856 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4359857 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4359858 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4359859 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4359860 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4359861 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4359862 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4359863 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4359864 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4359865 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4359866 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4359867 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4359868 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4359869 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4359870 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4359871 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4359875 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4359876 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4359877 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4359883 it truly is an epiphenomenon even my medical background doesnt give me any answers
4359884 if its not physiological then i think it has entirely to do with the perseverance of women
4359885 they have more perseverance about life and commitment and passion as they get into their 30s and 40s i think that would apply and maybe thats all it is maybe its that phenomenon
4359886 i think it depends on the person and their genetics
4359887 i definitely dont have the genetics and i certainly cant say ive gotten better but ive maintained and enjoyed it i think as ive gotten older ive valued it more
4359888 ive found since the peak race is more of a combination of hiking and jogging ive had more longevity you dont have to train or pound on the roads
4359889 i think as you get older you realize how important rest is
4359890 the years of mileage under your belt allow you to do that you dont have to train as many miles you still have the kind of base that you did because youve done it for so many years
4359891 we are getting some younger ones now with the prize money and thats going to make it where you wont see the older people winning anymore

4359927 it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning
4359928 weve been working for years on making sure the standards we teach and the way we teach them aligns with how students are tested
4359929 i think the closer we can bring instruction into alignment with the state standards the more success students will have in taking those tests
