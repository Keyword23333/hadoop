1390000 we intend this extension to reassure trucking companies that they will have sufficient time to realize a return on their investment and we anticipate additional participation with this extra time
1390001 given americas concerns with the entry of illegal drugs terrorists and illegal immigrants across our weakly defended borders it is incomprehensible that mexican trucks would continue to be allowed unfettered access to our country
1390002 for the sake of our national and economic security and for the safety of our citizens this programs needs to be stopped now not continued thats why i strongly support h r 6630 a bill the house transportation and infrastructure committee passed late last month and is expected to be on the floor in september which would end this debacle once and for all
1390003 mexico is not prepared for this for the tremendous problems
1390004 illegal aliens are leaving because of increased enforcement combined with the bad economy and decline of the dollar
1390005 enforce our existing immigration laws crack down on employers cut off taxpayer benefits and empower local police and the illegals will leave
1390006 i dont feel pain anymore its like i never broke my leg i never watched the pictures of my injury and dont want to see it im hopeful i will forget it and continue my career as soon as possible
1390007 i have learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
1390008 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries
1390009 my target is to be as fit as possible after a month because the season is long we have to build it all up slowly with gym work cardio work and games it is really important for me to get a good start
1390010 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game
1390011 if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum it is important to win to get the answers to the questions
1390012 i think any of the top four can win the title arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointed but i am certainly committed to winning it and if you look around so is everyone here
1390013 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1390014 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1390015 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1390016 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1390017 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1390018 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1390019 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1390020 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1390021 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1390022 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1390023 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1390024 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1390025 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1390026 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1390027 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1390028 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1390029 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1390030 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1390031 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1390032 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1390033 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1390034 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1390035 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1390036 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1390037 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1390038 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1390039 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1390040 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1390041 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1390042 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1390043 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1390044 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1390045 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1390046 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1390047 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1390048 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1390049 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1390050 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1390051 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1390052 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1390053 no not actually we dont fall into their uh jurisdiction our operation is small enough not to be noticed and our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves
1390054 like the pensacola bay area housing market itself randy phillips and his wife heather hood have found themselves with too many homes and not enough buyers they have a house in north hill they cant sell a mortgage to pay on their home in east hill and another mortgage on their former home in orange beach ala
1390055 we hate to do it but were now thinking about putting the house in east hill on the market randy phillips said
1390056 they purchased their north hill home in 2004 just before hurricane ivan hit the storm took the roof off and we never spent a night in it phillips said
1390057 but they did spend a year and 50 000 repairing it only to decide it was too small for them they then bought their current home in east hill and in mid 2006 put their north hill home on the market for 259 000 thinking it would sell quickly
1390058 as soon as we bought the house in east hill the market turned phillips said
1390059 with so many houses for sale phillips and hood turned to the rental market for relief they managed to attract someone looking for an 18 month lease but the deal fell through and they were forced to put the house back on the market
1390060 several subsequent price cuts have pushed the asking price down to 199 999 more than 15 000 below what they paid for the house in 2004 burdened with three mortgages randy phillips says something has got to give
1390061 bill and teresa preston have had their 5 600 square foot home near bayview park on the market for the past two years with an original asking price of 895 000 while bill preston acknowledges that the original price may have been set too high it has since been dropped to 689 500
1390062 a few perspective buyers have looked at the house but so far no takers
1390063 i guess im luckier than most because im not desperate to sell said preston
1390064 i dont know exactly what the bankruptcy filing means for wcis future said perdido key realtor brenda beumer
1390065 wcis miami dade county developments include one bal harbour and miami beachs mosaic luxury condos priced from 1 1 million and 2 5 million respectively its website shows in broward its building homes in the parkland golf and country club and heron bay in coral springs
1390066 in a sign of just how challenging the real estate business has been for wci it reported 84 new condo orders but 174 cancellations or defaults in the second quarter a hundred of the defaults happened at one project pompano beachs the plaza at oceanside condominium the company disclosed last week
1390067 when you get more new cancellations than new sales its damn near impossible to continue functioning said jack mccabe a deerfield beach real estate analyst
1390068 locally wci built five condo towers and a carriage home complex in the hammock dunes community of flagler county it still owns more than 40 units in casa bella tuscany and le jardin towers wci also owns a vacant oceanfront lot at 1751 s atlantic ave in daytona beach the company paid 23 million for the 66 of an acre in january 2006
1390069 talk about fire sales laramar group of chicago in july paid about 32 million for the 160 unit oceanview apartments in boca raton the previous sale in 2006 was for nearly twice as much nrw development of miami paid 56 2 million for the apartment complex and planned to convert the 40 year old building into pricey condos
1390070 laramar will run the property as apartments and it plans renovations that include washers and dryers in each unit granite counters in kitchens and new floors rents will range from 1 500 to 3 000 a month
1390071 july was another month of record foreclosures in lee county and very little new construction of single family homes foreclosures are doing what theyre doing but the good news is that people are buying foreclosures so at least there is a demand for these said jeff tumbarello director of the southwest florida real estate investors association which tracks foreclosures
1390072 for every two deeds they take back theyve been selling one tumbarello said
1390073 the gluttony of existing and foreclosed homes on the market isnt doing the construction industry any favors foreclosures are being sold at prices new homes cant compete said jamie pirrello ceo of cape based vision homes usa
1390074 in fort myers beach there were no permits issued this month none last month either and two in july 2007
1390075 people are moving on or moving out of the area fulton said
1390076 the owner of the house on southwest 17th terrace had walked away but the bank had not yet taken ownership of the property
1390077 the problem with the foreclosures is the interim period said tommy lee president of the cape coral association of realtors
1390078 as the minibus swings into the driveway janet kenyon takes one look at the new three bedroom two bath house and lets out a shriek
1390079 kenyon and husband blu head inside to a pleasant surprise aw this is nice she coos stroking the faux granite countertops best of all the price 103 000
1390080 three years ago a house like this might have gone for 250 000 as investors swooped into cape coral and transformed the sleepy waterfront city into one of the countrys hottest real estate markets then demand dried up and by february the cape coral fort myers area had a new distinction no 1 in the nation in foreclosures
1390081 with nearly 11 000 homes in foreclosure 1 in every 31 households it could be two years before all the distressed properties find buyers
1390082 cheaper housing prices than those in the tampa bay area or south florida attracted hordes of speculators
1390083 blu kenyon likes cape corals proximity to interstate 75 and southwest florida international airport but the couple decided not to buy one house in cape coral instead they decided to buy three among them an 1 800 square foot home built two years ago for 314 500 todays price 99 000
1390084 an abandoned boarded up home that sits among the well manicured properties in the lakewood ranch country club is a symbol of one way in which the growing foreclosure crisis is marring some neighborhoods
1390085 the presidio glen home was owned by preston and saralynne slater who own another country club home in the 7400 block of riviera cove the slaters who were reportedly living in the presidio glen home at the time of the fire could not be reached for comment the phone at their riviera cove property has been disconnected
1390086 manatee building department director john barnott said he learned about the unsafe conditions at the home two weeks ago and then began trying to contact the mortgage firm they are a hard bunch to get ahold of he said
1390087 the problem is particularly acute in the sarasota bradenton market where an average of about 2 000 houses a month have gone into foreclosure since the spring
1390088 manatee county officials gave the company until last friday to say how it plans to correct the problems at the residence it was unclear if the company had responded by the end of the day friday
1390089 they are either going to repair it so it can be lived in or they are going to tear it down barnott said
1390090 stressed by increasingly heavy tax and insurance bills and the inability to generate rents to cover these costs some landlords are now walking away from their properties at the same time people who paid more for housing than they could afford during the boom are defaulting on their loans and joining the ranks of renters
1390091 jill lyons a rental specialist in sarasota said homeowners who might have been shelling out as much as 2 300 a month in mortgage payments feel extreme relief after moving into rental property where the rent is only 1 200 a month
1390092 scott corbridge president of sarasota management amp leasing said the supply of homes available to rent has grown this year as investors have given up on trying to sell their properties and are looking for temporary relief by renting them the result is that the additional supply is weighing on rents
1390093 what used to rent for 1 000 is now 800 corbridge said
1390094 the decline in apartment occupancy and rents is a direct result of the collapse of the housing industry in florida and landlords who provide housing at the lowest end of the market have been hit the hardest
1390095 ive got a place in englewood a working class duplex and im not getting any calls at 650 said al holmes president of the sarasota landlords association
1390096 theres a real emphasis on the investment potential said jared beck the condominium lawyer representing taglieri
1390097 dante alexander president of the national association of condo hotel owners estimates there are more than two dozen condo hotel lawsuits under way across the country
1390098 it all started with the change in the residential housing market he said
1390099 u s district judge patricia seitz in miami dismissed 29 lawsuits friday against opera tower near downtown miami stating the contract was explicit about what buyers were getting no matter what a slick advertisement promised
1390100 the brochure showed a 56 story elliptical shaped building on the water with a nearby marina the illustration omitted surrounding high rise buildings the one and two bedroom units were priced from 200 000 to 800 000
1390101 developer tibor hollo said the lawsuits filed against opera tower are from flippers upset with the turn in the housing market
1390102 much of the time miami native kenneth h thomas a nationally known banking expert is traveling often to philadelphia to lecture at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania where he got his doctorate in finance in a recent interview thomas weighed in on the state of the banking industry and the economy
1390103 q when will the housing market begin to turn around a i dont think the market will improve in terms of normal price appreciation until perhaps two or three years which could be the end of 2010 maybe 2011
1390104 q who is to blame for the current banking woes
1390105 the gluttony of existing and foreclosed homes on the market isnt doing the construction industry any favors
1390106 a few perspective buyers have looked at the house but so far no takers
1390107 in my belief chief among them will be the fact that former fed chairman alan greenspan kept rates too low for too long
1390108 former fed chairman alan greenspan kept rates too low for too long and it may very well be he was inordinately influenced by the white house based on my analysis of his very frequent visits there but we dont really know that
1390109 unfortunately a lot of prices people paid then dont have a lot of meaning in todays market
1390110 when they couldnt make the extra money they didnt want to close and they sued for their deposit he said
1390111 such deals are especially enticing to europeans whose strong euro makes a 128 000 home cost the equivalent of 82 000 word of foreclosure driven bargains has spread so far that a german tv crew was recently in town to make a documentary
1390112 stressed by increasingly heavy tax and insurance bills and the inability to generate rents to cover these costs some landlords are now walking away from their properties
1390113 three years ago a house like this might have gone for 250 000 as investors swooped into cape coral and transformed the sleepy waterfront city into one of the countrys hottest real estate markets

1390141 precisely at the moment in history when we need to shift our system of food production into overdrive our agricultural engine is breaking down
1390142 the trend toward larger farms and more technological advances will limit the job opportunities to the point that almost all job openings will be due to the need to replace workers
1390143 however employment in agribusiness and in the natural resource sector is expected to moderately increase many job openings will be in the landscaping and grounds maintenance sector as the public is demanding these services to free up time for other activities and many older people are physically unable to perform these duties

1390220 two members of this terrorist group were executed early on sunday
1390221 they the court told me that they have an order to come and arrest me
1390222 im waiting for them the court to send me the paper and see what it is and then i will go there with my lawyer
1390223 you kind of feed off each other you see every starter going out there and doing really well and you want to match them
1390224 i think it is contagious its a pretty amazing staff here
1390225 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1390226 when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
1390227 he didnt have his usual sharpness on his breaking ball
1390228 we got nobody out in the bullpen just terrible pitches balls flying around everywhere
1390229 we have to have someone step up and make pitches not very much fun
1390230 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1390231 i was more relaxed i had a different feeling on the mound
1390232 ive got one responsibility and thats to try and give this team a chance to win obviously i didnt do it tonight and its very frustrating
1390233 it was big because of the way that we did it against the team we did it against factoring in the circumstances
1390234 i was trying to nibble way too much trying to make perfect pitches and ended up missing by a lot most of the time
1390235 in that situation he has to keep the ball in the zone and come to me
1390236 we have a job to do tonight and every night for the rest of the season but at the same time its my sixth season in baseball and ive never made the playoffs
1390237 its obviously in the back of my mind that i could play in october
1390238 i wish we could have won the game because it would have been something special for us but i think we showed what were made of
1390239 if were going to get to the point we want get to theres no doubt our starting pitching has to do a better job
1390240 you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever you want
1390241 we just have to win both series and take whats coming
1390242 hes such a good pitcher sometimes he can use a teams aggressiveness against them
1390243 florida has a very aggressive team they hit a lot of home runs jamies style matches up good against them hes such a master of what hes doing he can see what theyre swinging at and move it a couple of inches
1390244 i dont have an answer theyre all good hitters they give you good at bats they battle its a matter of making pitches
1390245 on monday well fly up to philly and deal with jamie moyer try to figure out that one first
1390246 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1390247 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1390248 i was working more on mechanics and keeping my endurance up not focusing on improving the starts itll be good to do a regular session for now
1390249 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
1390250 it was something ive been looking forward to for a long time its just good to get back out there and compete i went out there with the mind set that i would go as hard as i could for as long as i could
1390251 we are playing better defense and have played four clean games so far
1390252 he showed some growth the last two starts when he got in the stretch and for whatever reason he fell back in that trap door
1390253 im hoping its a bump not a hill but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
1390254 i was so excited to be back out there pitching
1390255 i didnt take it for granted i tried to enjoy it more and appreciated it more than i did before i got hurt
1390256 main reason to why she left dunman high is too much for anyone to accept

1390277 supone un nuevo r cord negativo en toda la serie hist rica del paro registrado desde que se cambi la metodolog a de medici n en 1996
1390278 julio supone ya el decimocuarto mes en el que el desempleo se incrementa de manera consecutiva dicho con otras palabras ya se cumple m s de un a o desde el que el incremento interanual del paro no cesa de aumentar adem s cada vez con un nuevo r cord de la serie
1390279 quinto peor dato del a o bastante en l nea con lo que sucedi en junio
1390280 por sectores y aplicando el m todo anterior vemos que la explicaci n m s com n en los medios de comunicaci n del aumento del paro no es del todo cierta la construcci n ya no es el principal responsable ya que su ritmo de crecimiento se est estancando e incluso cayendo
1390281 casi de la mitad del aumento del paro de este mes aportan el 49 por ciento de los nuevos parados respecto a mayo de 2007
1390282 llamativo el incremento del paro intermensual de este sector en un mes de julio 0 9 por ciento cuando estacionalmente es el sector que mejor se comporta en dicho mes no obstante es cierto que los servicios siguen creando empleo pero a ritmos de crecimiento insuficientes 1 6 por ciento para absorber la oferta de trabajadores sin que aumente al paro
1390283 la mala tendencia que llevamos observando desde enero con incrementos interanuales del paro registrado cada vez m s significativos de hecho este mes ya registra crecimientos del 15 2 por ciento
1390284 paro se reduce por el repunte de las contrataciones propias de los meses estivales esto no s lo no sucede en este a o sino que la cuant a de los incrementos es preocupante
1390285 si el paro aumentara a partir de agosto tanto como lo hizo el a o pasado 160
1390286 entre agosto y diciembre el desempleo se incremente al menos tanto como lo ha hecho entre enero y julio de hecho es una estimaci n bastante conservadora
1390287 especialmente bueno para dicho sector por el repunte de las contrataciones estivales cuyos ritmos de crecimiento en a os anteriores fueron del 3 3 por ciento en julio de 2007 y del 5 por ciento en julio de 2006
1390288 entre julio de 2007 y junio de 2008 el desempleo ya ha supuesto 2 770 millones de euros m s que en el mismo per odo del a o anterior y de continuar al actual ritmo de crecimiento ascender a a 4 600 millones m s
1390289 el gasto total en subsidios de desempleo ser a de 20 000 millones de euros
1390290 es una decisi n que no se comprende porque la informaci n estad stica debe ser siempre de la mayor calidad posible especialmente en las pocas de crisis en la que nos encontramos

1390315 a medida que pasa el tiempo y la mirada hacia atr s se hace m s amplia y consciente aparece cada vez mayor casi sobrehumano el m rito de montini al presidir el concilio conducirlo felizmente a t rmino y gobernar la agitada fase postconciliar

1390321 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1390322 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1390323 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
1390324 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people

1390327 la obediencia como dice santo tom s debida a los superiores es seg n el orden divino puesto en las cosas
1390328 la obediencia es buena en consecuencia puesto que el bien consiste en el modo la especie y el orden
1390329 hay que obedecer primero a dios que a los hombres
1390330 la ley natural es una participaci n de la ley eterna en la creatura racional
1390331 la ley tir nica como no es seg n la raz n no es simplemente ley es mas bien una perversidad de la ley
1390332 si verdaderamente en algo no concuerda con la ley natural ya no ser ley sino mas bien una corrupci n de la ley
1390333 si no se ve que la ley es justa no fue ley
1390334 yerra si se estima que la servidumbre abarca a todo el hombre la parte mejor de l esta excepta el cuerpo est sometido y adscrito al se or pero la mente es su derecho
1390335 as en eso que pertenece al movimiento interno de la voluntad el hombre no est obligado a obedecer sino solo a dios
1390336 a dios el hombre est subordinado absolutamente en todo lo externo y lo interno as se est obligado a obedecerle en todo los s bditos por el contrario no est n subordinados a sus superiores en todo sino a algo determinado y en cuanto a esto son los superiores los mediadores entre dios y los s bditos en cuanto al resto verdaderamente inmediatamente se subordinan a dios lo cual son instituidos la ley natural o la escrita

1390659 i just picked up the chainsaw and started carving one day
1390660 and i have some artistic ability so it was somewhat easy for me

1390674 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1390675 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1390676 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1390677 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1390678 the cable companies have done just about all they can to damage tivo by keeping them outside the fraternity

1390689 the story was clay was a great editor and a bad businessman and murdoch sensed that
1390690 i said howard were here because we just wanted to tell you we hope youre client mr murdoch will step back and realize if he goes through with this hostile takeover were going to leave were not going to work for him and i dont think he wants that to happen and it would undermine the value of the property he was buying howard looked at me then walter then dick and says ken are you finished well let me just say that youre furniture murdoch is the cunt behind myspace of course consider yourself part of the furniture so the page youre reading could be destroyed any time all he has to do is blow cigar smoke across my page and im gone the first thing is i cant tell you who the new editor is i cant tell you the name of any feature editor of the modern new york magazine for that matter im looking at the inside credits and i can tell you the publisher is lawrence c burnstein but nowhere can i find an editor advertising like culture and entertainment director luxury goods and retail director real estate director and so on and there are credits for creative services such as creative services director special events director event sponsorship sales director and there are credits for research like research director research manager and there are credits for marketplace like general manager advertising business manager account managers and in finance there is of course a chief financial officer and so on and in circulation there is a director of circulation an acquisition director and so on and communications and business development has a director a business development analyst a communications manager and a communications coordinator and so on and so forth and in operations youve gotta have a chief operating officer else what are but for the life of me looking up and down the page i cannot see an editor anywhere without tom wolfes feature on clay felker and the testimonials from other writers this magazine would have the corporate face of any modern glossy its all about whats for sale and what will remain when the stadium or some of it is redeveloped as parkland there is no resonance about the weight of community history that will be buried in the demolition and no evaluation of what this means theres an article about the queen of harlem real estate the white woman called suggs who leads the way in hiking up property prices in harlem and to hell with the residents who cant afford to stay in their homes this feature captures the unscrupulous self serving loud mouth very clearly by letting the woman speak for herself and leaving the reader to judge her opinions when the article isnt quoting her its paraphrasing her harlem gentrification suggs says comes down to the happy campers who bought at the right time and the stupid people who didnt

1390712 the fed remains handcuffed by weak economic activity from an ongoing credit crunch and uncomfortably high inflation the accompanying press statement will probably see little change from the june 25 communiqu
1390713 admittedly oil has dropped by over 17 from its peak suggesting that the fed should be less concerned about its impact on inflation expectations
1390714 however note that the fed cut rates to 2 as insurance against a severe credit crisis the fed is likely to question if rates need to be kept so low as credit conditions stabilize
1390715 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely

1390819 others have the idea right to seize the opportunity to start new businesses make new partnerships forge new networks
1390820 their problem was building something too early that was too big and too scattered
1390821 they had okay stuff a cartoon show and a car show and a show about making special effects but you cant leverage the audience from any one of those to watch any of the others creating good content can be so expensive and the ad revenue to support that wasnt there yet it was too early
1390822 rocketboom was an early success but to stay in the game now we just need to continue to make consistent quality content were in a good position time wise
1390823 our plan is to grow like the comedy central daily show did at first steven colbert would appear on the show just occasionally and viewers would clamor for him to do more spots and the producers would have him back more often eventually once his popularity and audience was already there they created the colbert report spinoff from the daily show
1390824 but unlike the daily show which has 19 writers rocketboom has one but i think you wrote something about
1390825 we kind of stumbled accidentally on that same idea for growing rocketboom
1390826 the hyperbole of being first out of the gate well first to get a lot of attention that was enough in the beginning
1390827 that wears off after awhile three years ago if you showed up with a video camera and a microphone people would freak out as great as it was i always felt embarrassed at the attention ive just always been trying to make things as good as i can
1390828 2010 fifa world cup in south africa the greatest sporting event the world will ever see
1390829 ive been coming to soccerex for more than 10 years now
1390830 this is an important part of the business of international football and strengthens the commercial character of the game
1390831 the provincial government will ensure that we honour the commitments we have made to satisfy all fifas requirements and meet the high expectations of people throughout the continent and the world
1390832 each time i come here i see the amazing evolution of the stadium the stadium is a star performer in the construction
1390833 hosting the fifa world cup in south africa in 2010 will be a unique moment and that is why we must make it happen
1390834 why should i call if im home safe if there is a problem youll get a phone call
1390835 i would keep a 27 man squad for the coming league season because i believe it should be enough to get the results if all the players would work according to specific instructions
1390836 some would differ on this but i think it is the best situation for the club it means the players must work hard to get in and that can only be good for the club it has worked for me before so i hope it would work once again to perfection
1390837 we are ready and we also want to say that all the clubs will be in abuja for the draws
1390838 everything is set and the nigeria football league wants to show nigerians that we are set to transform the league once again
1390839 the draws will be shown live on national television and we want to show some level of transparency
1390840 it is also good that everybody will watch the draws live on television that will help the league in so many regards
1390841 we needed this change because we wanted to get a smooth playing ground which will get the best out of the team
1390842 we cant wait for him forever i dont think he wanted to be here in the first place otherwise he would have reached us after all the efforts we made to speak to him
1390843 we have replaced him with dapo from the alternate list and we will just have to make do with that
1390844 for us taiwo is over 23 and does not form part of the players concerned with fifas injunction
1390845 cas will rule on the problem on tuesday and we will conform to its conclusions if the decision favours the nigerian federation taiwo will go to the olympics if they say the opposite he will not go
1390846 with all modesty no body or team can stop us from winning the football gold medal at the olympics i have declared and vowed to put in my all to help this team surprise everybody by winning the gold medal
1390847 we know that it wont be easy playing the dutch team on thursday but i can tell you that even without taye taiwo in camp with us our coach has already mapped out plans to surprise holland we only need the prayers and full support of nigerians home and abroad and i am sure we will not only shock the dutch team but the entire world
1390848 we are determined and focused on the assignment here even though it is not going to be easy at all to achieve this
1390849 in the low density suburbs they will start with domestic workers only maybe it is because some of the house owners can afford to buy most of the commodities
1390850 but the issue will be looked into so that they low density house owners would also benefit
1390851 in the low density suburbs only the gardeners and housemaids will benefit house owners in the low density suburbs would start benefiting during the next phase currently there are no teams on the ground who are collecting the names of the housemaids and gardeners but they will be there soon
1390852 the first phase will see the construction of new schools while we will also put final touches to structures that are already in existence in the constituency as you might be aware this is a resettlement area and the educational institutions are not yet up to standard and we want to make the learning atmosphere more conducive
1390853 once we are through with this phase we will then look further and electrify all the schools in the constituency these are long term plans which we hope to see through finances permitting
1390854 as government we will continue to empower the people to a stage where they are self sufficient
1390855 pirates is my home and at this stage it has not crossed my mind to play for another team i am also happy that the club has also shown its appreciation of my services
1390856 with the telkom charity cup trophy in our cabinet we can now look forward to getting more medals this season
1390857 actually i was scheduled to join united last friday but due to the swazi telecom charity cup i had to delay my departure i am not too sure of the trial details but when i reach pretoria i will meet with shongwe
1390858 if he convinces gavin hunt then he might stay a longer period and if all goes well he will sign him so its a challenge to the player to showcase his talent
1390859 the crop that i planted was severely damaged after war veterans ordered my workers off the land as they campaigned for president robert mugabe in the june presidential elections and the little that survived is still facing many challenges which include persistent power cuts and shortages of fertiliser
1390860 power cuts are becoming frequent and as a result the load shedding schedule that the zimbabwe electricity supply authority zesa had availed is not being followed on most days we get electricity during the night and it is impossible to do any meaningful irrigation at that time
1390861 most of the wheat and maize i planted has died off and i will realise far less than what i was supposed to get if electricity was supplied continuously
1390862 close to half of the wheat i planted is damaged and the one field i am tending now is of poor quality due to the water shortage and i have cancelled any future plans of growing any winter crop
1390863 if i had not got any interruptions on the farm i would have put over 100 hectares under irrigation but the countrys politics is affecting current production
1390864 this is my first winter wheat crop but most of it has been destroyed because i have not been able to draw enough water to irrigate the crop and the power outages have been very frequent of late the harvest i will get will be far below my expectations
1390865 the crop was damaged at an early stage as we used to have power for about three days a week but now electricity supplies are being cut almost daily and this is disturbing irrigation cycles most of the wheat is now facing problems
1390866 the projected wheat winter crop is not good but we have learnt a lesson and already we are now preparing for the summer crop
1390867 we are making sure that seed companies are getting seed and fertiliser ready for the season and already we have imported 30 000 tonnes of seed for the 2008 09 season the country needs 50 000 tonnes of seed for planting two million hectares of maize and the rest will be supplied by local manufacturers
1390868 zimbabwe requires 400 000 tonnes of wheat per annum but this year we will hardly get 80 000 tonnes and the reasons are several power shortages and a serious shortage of compound d fertiliser which was nowhere to be seen in the country and as a result many farmers reduced the amount of land they planted
1390869 we will get the smallest crop of wheat that has been produced in this country this year and the only solution to the current farming crisis is to have a political settlement that will address the current problems anything else is just a stopgap measure

1390878 we are entering the period of highest risk of bluetongue and as midge populations become more active the threat of virus circulation increases
1390879 while we are seeing a significant number of new cases of bluetongue in mainland europe some 2 000 cases in northern europe to date we have not yet seen the disease in wales
1390880 this is due to the controls imposed across europe and the successful vaccination programme in england and wales so far
1390881 we are raising the profile of these type of issues
1390882 we have to play our part in delivering a positive message about football
1390883 football engages motivates and inspires but we know it can spill over and get ugly
1390884 we all have responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense now there is a dedication from all quarters including the media to do that
1390885 we want prevention rather than sanction and weve given credit to the media for playing a major part in the reduction of simulation
1390886 now we want to see this programme becoming much more than just a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable

1390906 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
1390907 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
1390908 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
1390909 across human societies very public acts of generosity such as philanthropy bystander intervention and heroism at war are primarily male activities
1390910 women just tend not to advertise their philanthropy as much as men
1390911 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1390912 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1390913 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1390914 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1390915 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1390916 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1390917 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1390918 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1390919 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1390920 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1390921 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1390922 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1390923 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1390924 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1390925 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1390926 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1390927 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1390928 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1390929 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1390930 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1390931 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1390932 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1390933 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1390934 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11

1390943 the air is not so bad it could be worse
1390944 this is my first olympics and i didnt know what to expect but its better than i thought
1390945 we all had some breathing problems when we arrived but its gotten better day to day
1390946 i can say the food tastes good and the quality i think its ok for sportsmen
1390947 we did have someone come in for psychological treatment but that was a chinese who was apparently under too much stress on an olympic job
1390948 im dedicated to posting first because i think its important i think poeple need first posters
1390949 we certainly have to monitor the casualty and that unfortunately means stopping the stretcher and opening all the insulation so we can get access to the casualty for vital signs like breathing pulse and blood loss
1390950 although essential the intrusion itself does not help the casualty
1390951 what doctors tend to be interested in is trends what is happening over one or two hours
1390952 if the information could be relayed to doctors they could perhaps be better prepared for the casualties arrival
1390953 it is frustrating to find such planned cheating is still going on
1390954 the dna analysis shows urine not belonging to the athletes they have a case to answer
1390955 this is an example of systematic planned doping and it is one of the examples under tougher new iaaf rules for exercising the longer ban of four years the iaaf has done a really good job of revealing a very bad doping story

1390958 being here is great but this wasnt the real show
1390959 it was like an audition for the olympics we passed the pre olympic test but now were going to go and take care of business
1390960 this is rehearsal now were getting ready for the big game
1390961 i dont think there has every been a game when we played australia when it wasnt physical
1390962 ive been to three olympics games and this diamond ball is by far the best in terms of preparation
1390963 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1390964 this was a great tournament for us in terms of our preparation and i couldnt have asked for more
1390965 our goal in the olympics is to try and beat new zealand
1390966 thats the team that we think we have a shot to compete against the rest of the time is just a learning experience for us

1390975 you see a lot of court cases from fashion labels that dont want their designs copied
1390976 but a lot of young people see things differently they are used to using the internet exchanging information on a free basis
1390977 everybodys free to use the designs as long as they attribute us as the source
1390978 if they make new works based on this they must publish them under the same creative commons licence
1390979 part of our philosophy is not to be a one man band but to involve the creativity of other designers into the label
1390980 i would really love it if one of our designs gets worked into something completely new and comes back to be part of our collection
1390981 i really believe we will be seeing more of it
1390982 its something happening in many aspects of design and also in science to have more openness and this will definitely happen in fashion
1390983 yes there are people arguing it is demonstrating ideas that dont have a value or a confidence to them and ultimately it is a good way to dilute even the best idea by dividing it up between the lowest common denominators
1390984 but if you look at the case studies and the evidence it provides companies with new ideas and divergent views and greater market opportunities and penetration

1390987 its kitten season and were right in the middle of it
1390988 were seeing dogs fly out the door but cats we have a little bit more of and so the idea being people are finding their income is a little bit short tie of year
1390989 lets say that we have one un spayed female lets just say she gives birth to a very conservative number say four kittens a year two of those are females within seven years she can contribute to 10 000 cats so thats the cat issue that were dealing with
1390990 they think well just have a few kittens and well get rid of them all somewhere and all of a sudden there are kittens up the ying yang

1390992 despite the progress we have made we are not on course to meet universal access targets and in fact appear to be slipping away from our existing commitments
1390993 it appears that we are poised to accept defeat when victory is still within our grasp our failure to meet those commitments will have an impact on millions of lives this cannot be allowed to happen it is time for nations to live up to their commitments

1390996 pledged the resources of his charitable foundation to refocus on domestic aids
1390997 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1390998 the william j clinton foundations hiv aids initiative has focused overseas primarily in africa and the caribbean the foundation is credited with helping negotiate drastically lower prices for anti retroviral therapies and diagnostic tests in places such as senegal tanzania rwanda and haiti
1390999 clintons foundation has worked to reduce the cost of drugs by 50 percent and help more than 1 million people get access to care
1391000 nearly three decades into the epidemic most young people in heavily affected countries lack basic knowledge about hiv in countries with concentrated epidemics most populations at greatest risk of exposure to hiv do not receive even basic hiv prevention services
1391001 for years the debate has raged over how to best spend dollars to combat the global scourge that is hiv aids treatment or prevention
1391002 as the 17th international aids conference opened last night in mexico city scientists clinicians and activists alike were stressing that aggressive treatment not only allows those who are infected to live longer and be more economically productive it makes sufferers less infectious which can help slow the spread of the epidemic that realization has placed a renewed focus on marginalized groups such as men who have sex with men sex workers intravenous drug users women and children who are front and centre at the conference this year
1391003 the u s centers for disease control and prevention revealed this weekend that it has markedly underreported the number of new hiv cases occurring annually the cdc said the number was about 56 300 in 2006 not 40 000 as it reported previously the agency said that about 1 1 million americans are living with hiv aids
1391004 new infections are dropping in some groups but not in others infections among men who have sex with men have been steadily increasing
1391005 twenty seven years into the epidemic that started in this group gay and bisexual men still account for more than half of all new cases
1391006 the data really confirm that the most severe impact of the epidemic continues to be among gay and bisexual men of all races and among black men and women
1391007 data from the cdc show that 70 percent of new hiv diagnoses among teenagers and 65 percent of hiv infected newborns are black about half of all aids cases in the united states are among african americans and the hiv prevalence rate among black men is three times the overall rate in the united states clinton said
1391008 their infection rate is seven times that of whites infections among hispanics are three times higher
1391009 that experts say is where more hiv prevention money needs to be spent
1391010 cataloguing the clutter and everyday items that make up the contents of a family house is an unenviable task
1391011 since january 2004 national trust staff and volunteers have been faced with just such a daunting project at tyntesfield a grade i listed victorian property in north somerset near bristol bbc panoramic tour here
1391012 the cataloguers have just recorded their 30 000th item and expect that by the end of the painstaking process which is likely to last another year they will have recorded the details of more than 40 000 objects so far the project has thrown up everything from the mundane the plastic bags of

1391047 theres no credible evidence that children of lesbian and gay parents grow up in any developmental way physical intellectual or social thats different from other children
1391048 and given that three million children of heterosexuals are growing up in this country in single parent households it is odd that lord tebbits attention isnt turned to them
1391049 where lesbian and gay parents are adopting theyre often bringing up severely disabled children
1391050 those selfless parents should be being lionised not demonised by lord tebbit
1391051 the concerns being expressed this evening are primarily about sodomy rather than about sexual orientation that is doing not being
1391052 is it not possible for such a person to hold the view that it is wrong for the state to compel him to refrain from arguing that sodomy is a social ill or to conscript him or his children into aiding and abetting it if that is the right expression
1391053 a childs life prospects are better if it grows up in a family with a father and a mother than if it lacks either of them in general these are indisputable facts

1391136 if you allow yourself to be affected by the star status thing then thats when your difficulties begin
1391137 you can only achieve success when the players want to please you and not the other way around some people fall into the trap of trying to keep players happy all the time and allow powerful personalities in the dressing room to rule the roost but thats not management it doesnt matter whether youre managing east stirling or manchester united you have to remember two things firstly youve got to have them trying their utmost to win for you and secondly youve got to have control and discipline over them anything else and youre fighting against the wind

1391171 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1391172 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode

1391177 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1391178 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1391179 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1391180 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1391181 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized

1391207 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
1391208 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
1391209 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
1391210 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
1391211 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
1391212 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
1391213 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
1391214 anyone serving more than 10 years at a football club these days is exceptional
1391215 especially with freedom of contract the bosman rule and agents its very difficult to get players to stay for that length of time particularly when theyre not from your country which i think is even more difficult it is difficult to say where people are going to be in two weeks time let alone two years and i certainly would not want to talk about what is likely to happen at this club it is not my domain
1391216 if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club
1391217 the important thing is we should also protect the player im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
1391218 i dont know i think so its normal because when there is speculation they believe in what they read
1391219 i am very happy here reports which suggest i have threatened to quit are rubbish
1391220 i love the club and the fans we have a great set of players here with a fantastic team spirit
1391221 i am a footballer i have a three year contract at arsenal but as you know a lot of clubs are interested in me
1391222 at the moment we are just going to sit down and talk and decide what to do nothing has been decided yet we will decide next week
1391223 i had a dream of playing for arsenal and arsenal are one of the loveliest clubs in the world
1391224 but now i have a chance of playing with one of the biggest clubs in the world i havent had a chance to speak to the manager yet but we will sit down next week and decide what is good for my career we will have to meet with the manager before anything can be decided but as you know better than anyone a lot of teams want me to play for them
1391225 if theyre going to get 50million for me and they bought me for 10million everyone is getting the benefits
1391226 barcelona have made a good financial offer and there is also the chance to play alongside great players
1391227 yes i am still under contract to arsenal but its up to the directors to satisfy my demands or ill leave if my good form of last season has increased my value my employers have to take account of that
1391228 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
1391229 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
1391230 i grew up through the arsenal youth team but its not a problem for me all my heart is at tottenham and all my passion will be tunnelled into doing well for tottenham
1391231 i have never wanted to leave the club and i dont intend to i have everything i want in life where i am right now for the past six years my life has been my family and chelsea football club some players can say that and it sounds clich d or fake i can say it because it is absolutely true i am very proud i play for chelsea and of what i have achieved as part of the team im very happy at chelsea theyve been the best days of my career
1391232 for the moment i am here on holiday with my family my future at chelsea i dont know anything yet
1391233 theres always speculation that im going here there and everywhere but im very content with my life and with my time at spurs
1391234 i will continue to play there for as long as i am happy and for as long as i am wanted its good to have a summer off but then i look forward to going back to spurs next season
1391235 but this is a new chapter in my life and one that i am looking forward to i had six great years at spurs and thank them for that there are players leaving spurs but there are also good players coming in i can only focus on robbie keane and what is good for me

1391713 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

1391730 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning

1391736 transmitting from france the soulighters guitars woodwinds keys and percussion offer a stumbling drunken clatter and drone that settles itself upon the listener like a blanket of warm confusion and guides the ear deep into a thick forest of drawn out pulses and reverberations ultimately manifesting itself in a ritualistic ambience with serpentine flashing and circular hum like church music if god were not only real but serious about his head

1391764 still we were surprised by the extent of operations of the laboratory
1391765 we thought it was just a small laboratory maybe with production of merely a hundred kilos or less we did not expect that it was a laboratory which could produce tons of shabu

1391828 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1391829 following a review in july of the companys ongoing regulatory capital requirements hm treasury has committed to a significant strengthening of the companys capital base

1391833 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal

1391835 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring

1391838 i was thinking that we had a great chance to win the national championship last year and in the back of my mind i began to think about maybe keeping a journal about the season something that would help me remember everything as it happened
1391839 we didnt end up winning obviously and there were many more twists and turns in the road than i had anticipated but the book is a lot like the blogs i wrote for the courant during the ncaa tournament its about what we did every day some inside information about the program id call it a fun look at what we do here
1391840 sometimes my teammates would see me writing on the road and ask me what i was doing

1392008 the restoration of a family friendly neighborhood park with fun functional playground equipment sturdy competitive fields clean well maintained bathrooms and a safe welcoming atmosphere for young and old
1392009 its in proximity to hundreds of families who could use a safe functional park space on the east end
1392010 but it started getting more and more rundown most of the equipment is at least 40 years old and the newer equipment is not really in compliance with current standards
1392011 there is a real diversity of people interested in the park
1392012 ive been really pleased from the very beginning because young families and older people are involved in the group

1392112 mr obama linked the arizona senator to president bush and mr mccain compared his opponent to paris hilton
1392113 it s too convenient and too condescending to dismiss the voters as fascinated by personality and uninterested in policy

1392121 i think it is wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
1392122 i think lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong the law is supposed to discriminate sometimes in some respects it is supposed to discriminate against social order and anarchy

1392128 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1392129 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1392130 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1392131 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1392132 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1392133 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1392134 nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
1392135 victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat for it is momentary
1392136 you dont need to try so hard next time sinn acts smart in field remind him of his infamous orange dallas hairdo that should do the trick ive done a bootcamp with t ive seen his pickups and kiss closes they are fast and solid this dude is nothin but a horn dog
1392137 the agent said swimming tickets are hard to get even harder than the opening ceremony
1392138 we regret to inform you that our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy
1392139 i have my daughter competing in the olympics and thats really great
1392140 its that i planned for two years for this trip spent tens of thousands of dollars to be there spent vacation time and now instead of packing my camera for the opening ceremony all i can do is go there and read a newspaper
1392141 the real harm here is this girl has spent eight years of her life getting ready to be on the world stage and she needs to be thinking about that and instead shes thinking about how her mom and dad got screwed out of tickets thats not right
1392142 i am going to have to tell my son next week that we will not be able to go to the olympics basketball game to cheer his stars kobe labron that i had promised to take him to
1392143 telling him this is going to be harder for me than losing the money
1392144 i really dont know what im going to do in china
1392145 the international olympic committee knew about this in march and didnt do much
1392146 a lot of people can still be accommodated if there were some adjustments to the transfer rules
1392147 the risks of a sharp downturn should dissuade the mpc from raising rates although we doubt that a cut will be forthcoming until next year
1392148 what happens next does it make it all better if i get one in my head does it make it all better if im found in the street
1392149 now after the third hung jury the idea now that suddenly in tampa there is new information previously unknown about this kid who has been investigated ad nauseam for at least the last five years or so doesnt make any sense to me
1392150 we expect another quarter of lackluster guidance for the fiscal first quarter
1392151 commentary so far this earnings season indicates that corporate it spending remains muted
1392152 a very high probability that the company will not provide any formal guidance on the coming fiscal year
1392153 investors will undoubtedly come out of the earnings call with a heightened degree of caution
1392154 i think most of us realize that its probably going to be a little bit longer than the one to two quarters that some people had hoped for
1392155 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating

1392192 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
1392193 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
1392194 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
1392195 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
1392196 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
1392197 its a little bit rude when your neighbors are fighting next door for you to go over and ask what happened its nobodys business
1392198 as a pitcher unless my arm falls off im probably not going to say anything
1392199 de kans dat andere kinderen elkaar op straat treffen is sinds de jaren 50 echter sterk afgenomen
1392200 het aantal kinderen van 0 12 jaar is sterk afgenomen de kans dat kinderen elkaar spontaan treffen is daardoor een stuk kleiner geworden en daarmee is een groot deel van de aantrekkingskracht van het buitenspelen verloren gegaan daarnaast durven ouders hun jonge kinderen niet zomaar naar buiten te laten gaan ze zien meer gevaren het straatbeeld is ook veranderd door het verdwijnen van buurtwinkeltjes al die verschillende ogen zijn verdwenen ouders zijn nu de enige toezichthouders geworden op straat tot slot is het binnenspelen gemakkelijker geworden omdat de gezinnen in het algemeen kleiner zijn met veel kinderen is er binnen meer ruimte

1392206 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
1392207 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling

1392212 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort
1392213 our country faces a critical challenge because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis is eating into the budgets of families across north dakota
1392214 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us
1392215 anybody who says we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1392216 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
1392217 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
1392218 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
1392219 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1392220 require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1392221 the polar ice caps are shrinking causing sea levels to rise extreme weather is wreaking havoc across the globe droughts are becoming more severe tropical diseases are migrating north and numerous species are being threatened with extinction
1392222 senator obama has no plan to address the energy challenges we face as a nation he has said no to offshore drilling no to domestic drilling and no to nuclear energy he has no plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1392223 the plan senator obama is announcing today is a much better approach while not perfect senator obamas proposal is a serious response to our nations most pressing energy problems it includes support for plug in hybrid vehicles a national renewable electricity standard and a low carbon fuel standard among other solutions senator obama should focus on continuing to advocate real solutions and avoid yielding to oil companies and allowing more offshore drilling
1392224 we are only a few months away from the expiration theres a lot of anxiety disappointment and frustration
1392225 the viability of solana is predicated on passing the extension of this itc investment tax credit
1392226 we do feel fairly confident that it will be addressed
1392227 but at some point we cant just keep going forward unless we know this subsidy will be there
1392228 i dont know what it will be but i think they will get there
1392229 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump
1392230 yeah 10 years from now two cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
1392231 consumers want to buy vehicles that get more than 30 miles per gallon
1392232 after looking through the long list of links slowly thoughtfully and falling in love with the
1392233 every single customer we have is able to take that tax credit
1392234 projects have to be finished and operating before they can take that tax credit
1392235 no commercial entity that weve done would touch it without the tax credit its a huge amount of money they save
1392236 our industry on a large scale is being harmed by the fact republicans and democrats cant seem to get on the same page whatsoever
1392237 i clearly understand the major role that renewable sources of energy must play in our national energy policy unfortunately we could write a blank check to the renewable fuels industry today and still not meet our countrys massive need for energy
1392238 oil companies have been subsidized for many years while continuing to make record profits
1392239 this is what the government said we would do before the election
1392240 we said we would bring forward water purchasing and thats what were doing
1392241 so we are simply rolling out the water purchase program as we were elected to do and as we committed to do prior to the election
1392242 we actually purchased high security water as well as general security and low security water so we did purchase high security water in the murray
1392243 we assessed the offers put to us by sellers on the basis of value for money which included an assessment of how environmentally valuable they would be so well approach this new purchase in the same way
1392244 the same lynx buses that help preserve our environment every day by taking thousands of cars off the road will soon be fueled with a cleaner carbon neutral energy source
1392245 i am committed to developing florida as a green technology business hub and investment in the production of ethanol and other biofuels will strengthen floridas economy and help us to meet our goals to reduce greenhouse gases
1392246 floridas clean energy future will benefit floridas economy environment and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1392247 while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
1392248 i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term position

1392371 siti masih belum menetapkan tentang sambutan itu tetapi insya allah majlis ulang tahun itu tetap akan diadakan tidak kiralah sama ada secara kecil kecilan atau besar besaran
1392372 sambutan ulang tahun memang tengah difikirkan cuma siti dan suami belum duduk bersama untuk berbincang lebih lanjut tentang perkara ini
1392373 selalu berdoa kepada allah supaya siti dan suami diberikan kesihatan yang baik serta kebahagiaan berpanjangan apatah lagi kami sering menempuhi banyak dugaan dalam kehidupan
1392374 siti rasa kekok sikit semasa latihan sebab sudah lama tidak nyanyi lagu tradisional perkara ini tidaklah teruk sangat siti cuma nak biasakan lentur dan lenggok suara saja
1392375 alhamdulillah suara siti agak biasa dengan lagu tradisonal jadi masalah itu tidaklah terlampau merisaukan saya
1392376 ayie bagaimanapun menolak dengan baik tawaran itu dia kata tak apa dan tidak mahu terlibat dengan program berkenaan
1392377 lantaran itu siti teruskan dengan dua beradik lain untuk jayakan program ini dengan menampilkan pelbagai kelainan buat tatapan audiens
1392378 siti harap sangat rancangan hari raya dengan nyanyi lagu tradisional ini dapat membiasakan diri untuk masuk studio rakaman bagi album kontemporari dan fusion siti kelak
1392379 tak sabar rasanya siti nak buat rakaman album baru kalau boleh hendak rakam awal sebelum puasa ini tetapi siti kena tengok dulu jadual dan tarikh kelapangan siti
1392380 siti memang harap ia dapat dilaksanakan secepat mungkin kalau boleh album ini dapat dipasarkan sebelum penghujung tahun ini
1392381 kalau ikut perancangan siti akan tunaikan umrah bersama suami dan ibu mertua pada awal bulan ramadan ini
1392382 saya tahu ramai yang menantikan album tradisional daripada siti buat masa ini siti sudah pun mendapat material yang diperlukan dan siti sedang menunggu masa untuk masuk studio kalau boleh siti memang mahu merakamkan secepat mungkin dan keluarkan album itu dalam tahun ini juga
1392383 selain lagu yang siti terima sewaktu program anjuran macp dulu siti ada juga minta lagu daripada komposer lain seperti pak ngah
1392384 jadi kata orang sebelum saya merakamkan lagu untuk album ini saya gunakan peluang mengadakan program hari raya ini untuk mengasah kembali kebolehan saya menyanyikan lagu tradisional
1392385 maklumlah siti memang sudah lama tidak menyanyikan lagu seperti ini risau juga kalau lenggok serta patah lagu nanti berubah sebab sudah lama tidak berlatih terus terang siti memang teruja dan rindu untuk menyanyikan lagu tradisional harap rindu peminat juga akan terubat ketika menonton konsert ini
1392386 pada permulaannya penerbit program ini akan menyatukan siti saida saerah dan abang siti ayie tapi ayie terpaksa menolak dan tinggallah kami bertiga menjayakan program ini memang seronok kerana inilah kali pertama kami bertiga tampil dalam sebuah program bersama dan inilah juga pertama kali saya berduet dengan saida untuk lagu tradisional
1392387 siti juga menyanyikan kembali lagu ku mahu yang siti ubah suai muziknya menjadi pop tradisional konsert ini siti sifatkan sebagai lain dari yang lain kerana ia bukan saja memberi variasi dalam genre tradisional tetapi susunan muziknya juga ada sedikit perubahan kerana siti menggunakan khidmat pemuzik pengiring yang masih muda dan segar
1392388 siti masih belum tetapkan apa apa untuk mengadakan sambutan ulang tahun kedua perkahwinan siti cuma apa yang siti harapkan agar rumah tangga yang dibina ini berkekalan dikurniakan kesihatan yang baik serta sentiasa bersabar atas segala dugaan yang mendatang
1392389 mungkin kami akan mengadakan kenduri mengenai hadiah apa yang ingin diberikan itupun siti tak fikir lagi
1392390 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1392391 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1392392 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
1392393 saya sendiri sudah lama tidak muncul dalam mana mana program televisyen yang menampilkan lagu lagu tradisional jujurnya saya sendiri takut dan gusar sewaktu menjalani latihan untuk program ini
1392394 masakan tidak sudah lama tidak menyanyi lagu tradisional takut juga kalau tidak mampu membawakannya malah untuk persembahan juga lagu tradisional agak jarang dibawakan alhamdulillah selepas beberapa kali berlatih semuanya berjalan lancar
1392395 apabila menggandingkan kami tiga beradik di atas pentas memang seronok setidak tidaknya ia memberi peluang kepada saida dan saerah untuk menonjolkan bakat mereka dalam lagu berentak tradisional
1392396 muzik yang ditampilkan bukanlah irama tradisional semata mata tetapi ia lebih kepada fusion iaitu menggabungkan yang lama dan baru yang pastinya memberikan sesuatu yang baru terhadap rancangan sebegini
1392397 selain itu juga kami turut menampilkan barisan pemuzik muda yang berbakat besar dalam irama tradisional untuk menonjolkan bakat mereka
1392398 malah buat pertama kalinya juga kami tidak menampilkan datuk suhaimi mohd zain pak ngah sebagai pemimpin muzik tetapi sebaliknya faizal uzir yang diberi mandat menggalas tanggungjawab berkenaan
1392399 buat masa ini saya masih lagi berbincang dengan penerbit dan komposer yang telah menyumbangkan lagu untuk album ini biasalah setiap komposer mahu mewarnakan sendiri lagu ciptaan mereka
1392400 apa yang saya harapkan semuanya akan berjalan lancar dan semoga peminat sabar menanti
1392401 saya juga sentiasa mendoakan agar kami berdua memperoleh kesihatan yang baik tentang sambutan ulang tahun pula sehingga kini tiada sebarang perancangan setakat ini kami akan tetap menyambutnya mungkin bukan secara besar besaran tetapi sudah memadai dengan kehadiran keluarga dan teman rapat
1392402 saya bangga jadi rakyat malaysia bagi saya taiwan dan malaysia sama saja kemenangan ini sebenarnya begitu mengejutkan kerana menyangkakan ia akan menjadi milik penyanyi pujaan saya datuk siti nurhaliza
1392403 malah saya sendiri akui kurang popular di malaysia melainkan di kalangan orang cina dan peminat di taiwan kejayaan ini saya lihat sebagai batu loncatan untuk me lebarkan sayap ke peringkat yang lebih luas masa terdekat ini saya akan jayakan sebuah drama di taiwan
1392404 diharapkan dengan kemunculan album kedua nanti selain berjaya di taiwan bakat saya juga diiktiraf di negara ini apapun saya gembira dengan kemenangan ini dan ia peng iktirafan terbesar pernah saya terima
1392405 kalau dibandingkan kami dengan peterpan atau padi siapalah kami untuk bersaing dengan mereka namun kami bersyukur kerana peminat begitu mendukung kerjaya kami buktinya malam ini kami menang
1392406 jika album pertama dulu penghasilannya agak rumit namun saat meluncurkan album ketiga kami sudah bersedia dengan pembaharuan yang dibawakan
1392407 nyata usaha ini tidak sia sia kerana penjualan album ketiga kami mencatat jualan yang cukup membanggakan dan ter tinggi jika dibandingkan dengan album pertama serta kedua
1392408 kombinasi antara kami menjadikan lagu itu cukup kuat meskipun ia sebuah lagu yang dihasilkan secara suka suka namun kami tidak menyangka menjadi hit dan digemari ramai
1392409 no matter how good how honest how decent and how hard they have worked
1392410 people who hear these things suspect where theres smoke theres fire and back away from really good people
1392411 what ive been told is that its a slap in the face not to have a latino represent the district

1392413 the people of the peace camp in israel pushed us forward in our decision to continue with the suicide bombings
1392414 your debate about the future of the settlements and about the necessity of the presence in the territories just served to strengthen us to continue with the terrorist attacks the people of the peace camp in israel those who spoke of the end of the occupation and of retreat pushed us forward in our decision to continue with the suicide bombings

1392443 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1392444 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1392445 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1392446 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1392447 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1392448 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1392465 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1392466 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1392467 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama

1392506 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1392507 while the reliability of the key stage 2 results has to be treated with a massive pinch of salt there is no evidence of a decline in standards despite this years chaos primary schools are doing well

1392516 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role

1392729 i thought project porchlight would be a cool way to give back
1392730 i have a lot of friends who have asked me about project porchlight
1392731 its become part of my life answering questions from my friends who had never heard about cfls
1392732 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling
1392733 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1392734 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1392735 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1392736 saying that obama supports drilling is like saying that the manufacturers of peanut butter support insect parts and animal hair
1392737 but with senate democrats undercutting him what choice does he have

1392740 this does seem to be an example of systematic planned doping and under the new wada code that would mean an expanded ban of four years
1392741 the federation have done a very good job in revealing a very bad doping story which is just frustrating to find
1392742 its sad and very disappointing that this type of planned cheating is still going on
1392743 there is a due procedure for the russian federation to follow but the data is convincing and the dna analysis is 100
1392744 if the urine is proved to not be theirs then they certainly have a case to answer

1392755 klaus pietsch verantwortlich f r den bereich produktsicherheit beim kba sagte auf anfrage die beh rde sei im januar dieses jahres nach einem unfall aktiv geworden im juni seien die untersuchungen dann abgeschlossen gewesen und der verdacht habe sich erh rtet
1392756 bemerkt der fahrer diesen unbeabsichtigten bremsvorgang nicht rechtzeitig ist im extremfall ein selbstverst rkungseffekt bis zur vollen verz gerung am vorderrad nicht auszuschlie en bei motorr dern mit abs erfolgt dann eine geregelte vollbremsung bei motorr dern ohne abs oder abgeschalteten abs kann das vorderrad unter umstanden blockieren
1392757 an modellen die nach oktober 2007 gebaut wurden soll das problem nicht mehr bestehen hier werden andere handprotektoren verbaut so probst
1392758 ich w rde mir einen solchen im gespr ch ungef hr so vorstellen meine

1392776 the trust has identified a total of 19 new cases of clostridium difficile in july 2008
1392777 this is a reduction of four on the previous month and the trend shows a continuing fall in the rate of new infections this is the lowest number of new infection cases in the trust for more than 12 months
1392778 we are however seeing an increase in the number of relapsed cases
1392779 this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment
1392780 all of these patients have low levels of immunity to infection
1392781 in recent months the trend was in the right direction and in june the belfast trust was meeting its targets for c difficile
1392782 in july however this trend reversed and we had 58 cases recorded this compared with 27 in the previous month
1392783 today the figure is 28 patients with symptoms associated with c difficile infection
1392784 it is our intention to deliver a knockout blow to c difficile in belfast hospitals
1392785 we are building on the measures we have already put in place and drawing on the experience we have now accumulated and i am also asking the public to help us in the drive against c difficile
1392786 furthermore each change to packaging materials requires new validation trials which are time consuming and costly

1392819 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1392820 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems

1392875 i had a phone call from a friend saying st felix was on fire it is a huge blow i wouldnt be surprised if it was an arson attack
1392876 it is just lucky that the school was out as 400 people could have gone up in one foul swoop which doesnt bear thinking about
1392877 this is very sad and i feel physically sick this fire could threaten our home as i dont have any other way to pay the mortgage
1392878 this is a sad day for the whole of newmarket we didnt realise the fire was quite as bad as this i cant believe what has happened
1392879 we just thought it was a little fire but it is in fact a terrible inferno it is just a blessing that everyone was on their summer holidays at the time
1392880 st felix is a school which has a lot of things going for it a lot of youngsters in newmarket and the surrounding villages have grown up and gone to the school and i feel for the staff parents and children who currently go there and will have their education disrupted
1392881 i am gob smacked by what has happened as the school is an integral part of the town and you always expect it to be there i just hope the grim predictions about not being able to save the school turn out to be wrong

1392886 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
1392887 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1392888 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1392889 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1392890 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1392891 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1392892 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1392893 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1392894 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1392895 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1392896 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1392897 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1392898 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1392899 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1392900 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1392901 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1392902 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now lets trust the truth
1392903 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1392904 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1392920 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1392921 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1392922 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1392923 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1392924 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1392925 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1392926 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1392927 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1392928 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1392929 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well

1392931 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1392932 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1392933 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1392934 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1392935 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1392936 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1392937 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1392938 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1392939 just because we didnt win the gold medal doesnt mean we didnt have a great team this group made the summer a most enjoyable experience
1392940 you have to give korea all the credit they played a very good game they put pressure on us all day their pitching was outstanding we arent used to not scoring runs they also executed their offense to perfection overall they just played better than us
1392941 you have to credit their pitcher he limited our offensive production
1392942 that was real tough to recover from when korea built a lead it didnt slow down one bit they did it all very well today

1392946 for the past three years he had been a proper family man and a great dad to his children
1392947 he was really making a go of things and spending as much time with his children as possible
1392948 the last saturday he was with us he went to withernsea for the day with his three youngest children digging in the sand and having a good time
1392949 he would take his mother sheila and his children out regularly and they will miss the precious times they spent together

1393024 however there has been considerable damage done to us and in my part of the world what was somebody elses problem has become ours
1393025 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary
1393026 this turned into our problem when it shouldnt have been
1393027 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china
1393028 there will be though a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over

1393057 in addition the components that were used for overclocking were vital and we found that asus hardware and all other components from the different sponsors of aocc were exceptionally stable and top notch in terms of quality overclocking is increasing in popularity back in china and we think that 1 2 percent of the whole population are currently overclocking today

1393063 this is one small thing we can do to both improve the quality of air and reduce the amount of gas that we use
1393064 if we can do that well do that and try and be careful with taxpayer dollars
1393065 all of these cars are all turned off so they arent taking up any gas
1393066 the city has recognized in this policy that there really does need to be some exceptions for public safety
1393067 all of these police vehicles including vehicles from fire public works airport police all of them have emergency equipment that for public safety need to be operating at times and sometimes they need the engines to run that equipment

1393071 we have obtained seven sketches of suspects who could be involved in jaipur bomb blasts we are studying them for any link with ahmedabad serial blasts

1393079 its of no importance to me what anyone thinks of my participation
1393080 whats important is awareness of the facts and issues itruly believe when people have access to information for the most part they will make wise decisions
1393081 it was naive of me not to realize that of course and unfortunately short sighted greed and opportunism would step right up to the plate as usual and heavily invest in going down a bad road
1393082 its almost inconceivable that some would choose to do things like burn rainforests in malaysia to plant palm plantations or make biofuels that compete with basic food supplies
1393083 we absolutely need biofuels to play a part in solving our energy crisis demands but its essential to make them sustainably
1393084 im glad the message is finally getting across but i was not prepared for the enormous amounts of dollars and energy that has gone into producing bio fuels in an unsustainable manner

1393090 verr definito risponde il ministro nellambito del comitato di ordine pubblico quello che vogliamo sviluppare una situazione sinergica su tutto il territorio e per questo mi aspetto una serie di ordinanze specifiche che poi valuteremo nei contenuti per definire eventualmente delle linee guida
1393091 non vado la cina non ha fatto nulla per il dalai lama
1393092 il presidente berlusconi ha scelto di non partecipare e mi sembra un segnale positivo ha detto meloni poi mi sarebbe piaciuta una decisione comune da parte dellunione europea che mancata ci non toglie che non si possa anche essendoci porre dei problemi
1393093 penso che ciascuno di noi in patria e a pechino ha ribadito meloni possa fare un qualunque gesto da indossare qualcosa di simbolico a ricordare certi valori quando intervistati non partecipare alla cerimonia inaugurale uno degli strumenti bisogna ricordare che si rappresenta litalia che ha certi valori non un gesto che chiedo solo agli atleti ma a tutti i tifosi
1393094 capisco la partecipazione del ministro degli esteri in rappresentanza di berlusconi in quanto ci sono anche ragioni di solidariet europea per cui non solo non contesto ma capisco comprendo che gli atleti che si preparano per anni debbano e vogliano partecipare non mi unisco anche se non condanno chi crea pressione perch capisco le ragioni dellappello
1393095 io ha precisato il ministro ho deciso di non andare a pechino bench sia stato invitato per un motivo ben preciso se il governo cinese avesse fatto un atto di buona volont invitando il dalai lama

1393110 do people along the chain have responsibility for knowing where key ingredients are coming from the answer youre going to find in an era of globalization is yes
1393111 all you have to show is that the product was defective
1393112 over the past century americans images of china have fluctuated wildly from victim to heroic fighter to communist fanatic we have loved them and feared them and now as sara bongiorni shows in vivid personal terms we are in a new phase where it is a little of both china has become an economic giant that can step on our toes but that we must embrace
1393113 when the writer resolves to forgo chinese imports for one year she leads her lively family in a fascinating experiment that requires surprising feats of will power and ingenuity the familys adventure through the maze of modern americas consumer life is both thought provoking and delightful to read those little made in china labels will never seem the same again
1393114 breaking up is indeed hard to do as sara bongiorni proves in this winning memoir of her households one year boycott of chinese products equal parts erma bombeck and economics a year without made in china is that lively miracle a crash course in globalization that is also consummately entertaining
1393115 a funny and engaging story about one familys experiment in our global economy the bongiorni family does without sneakers sunglasses and printer cartridges but develops a dogged creativity and much needed sense of humor the myriad moral complexities in the relationship between american consumers and chinese factory are evident in each shopping trip
1393116 you will never go shopping the same way again its impossible to read sara bongiornis book and not be captivated by the complexity and challenge of her task and to then try it yourself for a day and fail miserably at it by lunchtime this is the rare book that makes you think about how big global issues actually hit home and it will have you discussing those issues with your friends

1393120 after reaching a very high level with the previous engine we raced we had to put considerable efforts into the development of the direct fuel injection unit in order to significantly improve performance and efficiency
1393121 in order to achieve revs of up to 11 000 with dfi technology it meant stepping into totally new territory
1393122 we had already recognized the advantages of this technology at the start of the rs spyder project and adapted them to the very special requirements of motorsport always in close consultation with our colleagues in the standard development department the methods and insights we obtained from our co operation are of considerable value for future development projects involving dfi technology
1393123 thanks to the substantial increase of energy efficiency theres no rise in the absolute fuel consumption despite the significant hike in performance on the contrary were even a bit lower
1393124 competition in the lmp2 class is at an extremely high level and it gets tougher race by race
1393125 therefore now is exactly the right time to race the new engine
1393126 the tyres have very good grip this years and are very consistent
1393127 the enormous torque produced by the tdi engine and the relatively high weight of a twelve cylinder make great demands of the tyres
1393128 we drive just a little bit quicker than the computer calculated
1393129 road america is one of the few tracks where you see the results on the stop watch if you risk something
1393130 this is an opportunity they cant get elsewhere and an opportunity to serve in the army
1393131 this is an attempt on the armys part to get at the educational deficit that could be out there for young people who made a choice early in life to drop out of high school
1393132 they now recognize the value of education and the army is able to provide them that education
1393133 if they dont meet our physical standards or educational standards successfully they go back to their hometown with no prejudices
1393134 were confident that we can capture their imagination and give them the quality of education the drop out rate will be very small
1393135 they are soldiers from the day they walk in and arrive at the reception station for in processing
1393136 they will be embraced by the cadre at the army prep school where they will immediately begin testing in their classes they will go through standard physical training are subject to usmj will learn customs and traditions but their focus will be to get their education
1393137 if it hadnt i would still be working a dead end job
1393138 pvt rucker went to three recruiters looking for ways to get in the army
1393139 because of education requirements there are high quality motivated citizens who cant join
1393140 the aps gives them an opportunity to serve their country
1393141 i have always wanted to join the army and help the country
1393142 i like this course because i would rather get into the army life rather than waiting around until i got my ged on my own
1393143 today only 28 percent of the 17 to 24 year old population qualifies to wear a military uniform the other 72 percent fail to meet minimum standards on education character and health
1393144 we will not lower our training standards so were faced with helping to raise the health and education standards for our young people who want to serve
1393145 road america happens to be one of my most favorite circuits the difficulty of elkhart lake is that it is so long in length obvious but a fact the circuits design is one of the most difficult to setup for very long straights with very slow corners that follow very heavy braking periods all things that create high fuel consumption so unless it rains which it always might after all we are in wisconsin or we have lots of caution periods which can always happen i look for a fuel consumption type of race
1393146 road america is a great fast track it reminds me a lot of europe it is a little like spa franchorchamps in belgium and this is what i like the biggest challenge is of course to stay out of trouble in the race and to score as many points as possible but also a big challenge is to drive quickly this track is a little like mosport quick and dangerous the quick corners and hard braking zones will require a lot of courage
1393147 i learned the track so now i know it but every time you come to a track you have been to you learn new things and secrets about the track
1393148 it is a priority to get points a dnf would be very bad for us especially now with the battle between us and the lizards so maximum attack but no risk that is the plan
1393149 for sure road america is a very demanding and challenging track with run offs and so on it still has the charm of an american race track and is also very close to our nordschleife i do very much like it i am just very happy that this track is on the calendar the biggest challenge is to stay concentrated for the whole lap because of the length of the track you can loose time easily everywhere
1393150 the trick this year will be to stay out of trouble the last races have shown that there are five cars that are fast and this will be the case at road america as well we are on a very good way to improve our self step by step even if it gets harder and harder we will keep improving we get all the support of all our guys michelin and ferrari which makes me really feel good
1393151 we as a team are fighting for the title and it is still early in the season so our main target will be to finish the race as high as possible because we need to collect the points i am very much looking forward to the race
1393152 road america has everything to offer in a road course in terms of turns straightaways and elevation changes the greatest challenge of road america as a driver is not to bite off more than you can chew last year i had the luxury of driving in the rain which made for a long and dark stint with little visibility i have to say in those conditions i learned quite a bit about patience and attrition
1393153 i approach this event more as a sprint race we need to be up front and not take a chance of being split by the lead prototype when a caution comes out

1393156 i am so thrilled to be playing for ulster and alongside a lot of big international rugby names i arrived on saturday and was met at the airport by a number of my team mates including isaac clinton and robbie who showed me where i would be staying and then held a bbq to welcome me it really made me feel less homesick as i was very sad on the journey over after saying goodbye to my family and friends i already feel part of a great team
1393157 the thing i miss and will continue to miss most is my family this is the first time i have been so far from home but i am keeping in touch daily through e mail a few of my family and friends now live in london and i have a fellow fijian police officer living in holywood so i will meet up with them and it will feel like being back home fijians like to watch and support their fellow fijians when they play so hopefully my family and friends in the uk will come to ravenhill to support me this season i have also been told the ulster supporters are very passionate just like at home and i am looking forward to performing well for them this season
1393158 the hardest thing for me to get used to so far is the weather i dont mind the cold although as this is summer i wonder what i will think in winter hopefully i will be used to it by then training in this type of climate is good for me i have to really push hard to get a real sweat up and so i am training harder and harder at each session im so proud that matt has given me the chance to play at ulster and i want to make him my family back home and my team proud
1393159 my style of rugby is very tactical and fast i prefer to use my speed and run with the ball around players rather than tackle them i learnt my style from my late uncle who also played wing for fiji in the 70s he was a real inspiration to be growing up and i am hoping to do him proud by giving my best to the team
1393160 im really looking forward to playing in the heineken cup a lot of my fellow fijians play for european teams so i know about the cup and what a big deal it is magners league i am not as familiar with but the guys tell me that it is a hard competition especially when we play against the two big irish sides leinster and munster and there are a lot of old rivals on the pitch the friendlies will be a great chance for me to get into my game before the real season starts i am looking forward to the queensland game and the chance to play a southern hemisphere side i think that will be a really great fast paced match all the guys are talking about the bath game as their former captain has now signed for the side they are all looking forward to that one

1393176 i was stuck behind alonso and then once he came in we could use the speed we had the speed but when you are stuck behind when you start in a bad place you cannot use it its a disappointing weekend but we got most of the points of the first three guys
1393177 im still in a good position but we need to sort out the qualifying and then once we start at the front we definitely have the speed in the races we need to be able to use it straight away in the first laps
1393178 thats the only thing that is hurting us saturday i went off the circuit it was my own mistake we just need to get the car like we want for qualifying after that if we can start at the front to win the race but when you start behind the people you cannot use the speed
1393179 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

1393182 the outcome of this summit will define our future prevention strategy and drive our way ahead for the campaign we will launch
1393183 the effort is intended to change behavior change influences on behavior and over the long term change the culture of our organization so our folks are adopting the traditional values we hold key to this institution we call the army
1393184 its not only for our professional military education but also our first responder training
1393185 and we are looking at training from the earliest possible point we can engage from senior rotc to junior rotc to the academy to the new recruits even before they hit the ground
1393186 one of the things that have become apparent to us is that the cohort of soldiers that we bring in the army every year has changed
1393187 societal norms and negative influences have changed in this population their norms are not like their fathers or grandfathers norms of what is acceptable behavior in this society
1393188 a young soldier 18 or 19 years old comes into the army and has been in an environment with his peers and with the influences upon him where he believes that inappropriately touching a female is acceptable
1393189 she may have not complained about it because of her influences and her social norms where in high school this happens all the time but in the army that is sexual assault
1393190 you take the opportunity to reeducate based on the army values respect
1393191 we use the army values as a benchmark and show that what was normal to them doesnt fit with our value system and again we work to change peoples attitudes and influence their behavior
1393192 were not going to be able to cut soldiers off from those influences
1393193 but that is not our intent our intent is educating them what were driving towards is for soldiers to be educated and have an understanding of what this crime is and isnt there are a lot of myths out there
1393194 we see things like the recent story where the young ladies did the bullying action the assaults then posted that on the web site
1393195 what they are looking for is validation are their actions acceptable are they going to be held accountable by their peers we know with our youth market that is coming in the army that they are driven by peer to peer accountability that is their largest influencer we have to look at that as we move our program forward
1393196 through our research and feedback soldiers are telling us how best to communicate with them we are looking at social networking whether it is a social networking site like youtube or face book a lot of the communication among people in that age group is anonymous
1393197 they feel validation through their anonymous ability to communicate with and maintain friendships with folks online

1393199 pfizers decision to locate their biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center in mission bay is a significant win for san francisco and is a clear indication that mission bay is one of the nations premier life science centers

1393202 if we want to defend islam from the negative image that it is acquiring around the world we cannot go on like this we must positively show that islam is a religion of peace and dialogue
1393203 dialogue represents an authentic quranic methodology and a prophetic tradition through which the prophets communicated with their people
1393204 dialogue is one of the most important mediums of spreading islam throughout the world
1393205 madinah society that was established by the prophet is the optimal model of positive coexistence of the followers of divine messages
1393206 deals with challenges and offers solutions to humanitys problems which are seen as the result of abandoning religion and estrangement from its principles
1393207 religion is accused of being the cause of violence religion is not the cause of violence the cause is its violent use by its followers
1393208 support and defend the right causes in relation to human rights violations
1393209 learning to know people of other faiths and other cultures and establish common principles that allow for peaceful coexistence and provide human society with security
1393210 mutual cooperation in spreading ethical values truth benevolence and peace to challenge hegemony exploitation moral degenerations harm to the family and other evils that threaten society
1393211 to take part in agreements between humanitys civilisations to protect peace in the world
1393212 interaction and communication with the followers of different islamic schools of thought to reach the unity of the muslim ummah and weaken fanaticism and antagonism
1393213 dialogue based on love and truth is the best path to bring happiness and harmony to the peoples of the earth
1393214 we have made our rich traditions and thoughts to the members of the other communities to which we belong
1393215 is imperative that religious freedom include the possibility of believers to actively take part in the public debate by being given social political and cultural responsibilities
1393216 i dont mean that all religions are equal but that all those who seek god have equal dignity

1393222 pumalakpak pa ako ng sinabi niyang 50 sentimos na lamang ang text mula globe papuntang smart
1393223 sabi ng dating opisyal kapag nasa loob ka ng malaca ang lalo pa sa lugfar ni arroyo madali ka mawala sa realidad
1393224 ang mga taong kausap mo ay sasaibhin sa iyo ang akala nila gusto mong malaman kahit na hindi yun ang katotohanan
1393225 sabi ni commissioner sarmiento hindi raw nila sinabi kay arroyo na promo lang ang 50 sentimos kaya pala nasa ibang mundo nga siya

1393228 human security act of 2007 which is popularly known as the
1393229 the milf leadership which is the central committee of the milf has an official position that the memorandum of agreement on the bangsamoro ancestral domain has been signed
1393230 our position is that after initialing both parties initialed the moa that is a signing
1393231 ceremonial and a formality in a way to announce to all throughout the world that a memorandum of agreement has been signed but actually the signing actual signing was done
1393232 so its a done deal as far as the milf is concerned
1393233 we want to be proud of it we want to announce it throughout the world that there is a memorandum of agreement between the moro islamic liberation front and the government of the republic of the philippines
1393234 that is a hypothetical question we will answer that if that comes not now
1393235 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1393236 the act of initialing the moa ad agreed text between the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf it was done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1393237 nothing this is not even a setback to the milf we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1393238 it is the arroyo administration which is shamed in the eyes of the international community there were so many ambassadors already in the malaysian capital to attend the signing ceremony only to be told that it was cancelled at the last minute
1393239 go through a constitutional test and this will be good in the long term in our work for peace

1393258 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
1393259 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
1393260 knowing that people are working hard to beat me it makes me want to work so hard to become unreachable and untouchable
1393261 it feels great to hold it and i dont want to let it go
1393262 i had the best time ever and it made me want to go back
1393263 we found chow my coach now and he said the complete opposite

1393273 the republican party sometimes can be too cynical negative and needs to be more hopeful and optimistic and energetic
1393274 you actually have to have some ideas that are relevant and meet the needs and concerns of people
1393275 i think the republican idea factory has been a little fatigued lately we need to have some new ideas
1393276 the brand name is damaged things need to be rebranded in some fashion
1393277 its got to be more than a slogan there has to be some programmatic proposals about what to do

1393292 i dont keep track of what faculty members and my colleagues in this office give
1393293 ive seen them write checks but i dont look over top of the desk to see how much the check is
1393294 theres a fine line between making it easy and available for employees to be good citizens versus applying pressure to give to a specific cause
1393295 giving is a very personal act its your hard earned money and you are making a social investment with it and you have a right to and should want to pick and choose how you do that
1393296 he was afraid that they would feel compelled to do it rather than doing it for their own reasons

1393372 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1393373 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1393374 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1393375 theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

1393389 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1393390 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1393391 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times
1393392 hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1393393 hes offering a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer and hes offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states

1393403 if you want to go somewhere in the evening here there are so many choices that you dont know what to do first
1393404 nothing in the city is more than ten minutes away
1393405 we have great hidden treasures here not just in the bank accounts
1393406 i know how much the auto industry and the auto workers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
1393407 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but right here in the state of michigan
1393408 we know that team sa has done everything to prepare for their participation at the olympic games and we hope that this incentive will simply motivate them a little further in striving to attain the dream
1393409 our flight lh4853 was parked with the brake on when another aircraft came by and just touched the tip of the wing
1393410 no one was hurt and all the passengers are now safely back in the terminal building we are hoping to be able to fly them all on to germany today if possible
1393411 the passengers on board would have felt some kind of bump but it hasnt caused any serious structural damage to the aircraft
1393412 friends and family dry run last night i was a little skeptical
1393413 why ask me i only saw a second i had to pee
1393414 with a backpack full of natty boh and a drunken smile on my face clipse played a set that compared to past performances left me wanting more
1393415 i was real stoked to see clipse close out artscape 08 and i was not disappointed well not too disappointed

1393417 i cant think of anyone i know whos less like morgan freeman than you
1393418 ive been reading his stuff for a while and the truth of the matter is that
1393419 robert has been with us for more than three years and is i believe now fully conversant with the very special demands associated with running a club of our size and stature
1393420 deere lard if this is how i am with a dog and leaving it at the vet it can only get worse when i become a mother and have to leave my kid at daycare or school in general
1393421 so then i start thinking of me glad im not a mother id so leave my kid someplace
1393422 branding best practices a guide to effective business and product naming
1393423 effective naming is becoming more important than ever due to the saturation of brand names the high failure rate of new products and the growing understanding that a breakthrough name can improve marketing efficiency and reduce future marketing investment
1393424 we knew that we had to join a major organization to guarantee our future at the same time we had the desire to protect our family heritage only bmr le groupe could fulfill both needs
1393425 partly a sentiment index if things are not getting as bad at a slower rate it can feel like improvement
1393426 qualitatively it changes nothing about our assessment of the economy growth is at best weak and inflation pressures remain elevated
1393427 will put us in an advantageous position for more profitable long term opportunities
1393428 demand for our energy efficient cost saving and high performance products remained strong in the second quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment
1393429 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1393430 the management team at norampac has a solid track record when it comes to restructuring and we have every confidence that they will deliver on this important objective
1393431 in q2 aggressive cost cutting and restructuring measures throughout our business groups together with increased selling prices were not sufficient to offset the negative impact of sharply higher costs in all sectors and difficult market conditions in our boxboard operations
1393432 so excuse the clich but what is a nice girl like you doing in a place like this
1393433 whats wrong what can i tell you nothing and everything it is just that we usually dont get such pretty girls around here
1393434 a friend of mine from the bank told me about this place he said they have good cheap drinks a good atmosphere and old time rock and roll he did however warn me about the kind of characters that hang out around this place would you happen to be one of those characters
1393435 well i am not sure if i am one of those characters but like most people i am a character know what i mean
1393436 sorry john but i dont give my number away to men that i meet in bars especially not a bar like this one
1393437 the whole world is a very narrow bridge and the main thing is not to be afraid
1393438 but in peru in the andes there is no indian culture left everyone has become christian and before we became jews we also were christians who went to church
1393439 we found a small river between trujillo and cajamarca and everyone immersed in it we took the people from lima to be immersed in the ocean and then we also had to remarry them all in a jewish ceremony according to the halakha jewish religious law
1393440 we laid down that condition because in the remote areas where they live there is no possibility of keeping kosher and it was important for us to ensure that they would live in a jewish environment in fact there was no need for the condition because they were in any case imbued with a love of the land of israel in a way that is hard to describe
1393441 because we saw their enthusiasm for the land of israel we understood that conversion was part of a complete process including aliyah immigration to israel so we told them just as you live in a community here you should join a community in israel too
1393442 rabbi mamo and i both live in gush etzion a group of settlements south of bethlehem and we believe that when it comes to community oriented settlements there are none that can compare with alon shvut and karmei tzur both in gush etzion which said they would be willing to absorb the new immigrants
1393443 we as the jewish agency bring to israel anyone who has been defined as being entitled to aliyah that is anyone who has been recognised as a jew by the chief rabbinate or the interior ministry
1393444 generally the potential immigrants are in touch with our aliyah emissaries and are given very reliable information about housing employment and education possibilities in israel but in peru we do not have an emissary there is only a small jewish community of about 3 000 people there so we only have an office in lima that is staffed by a local woman therefore the jewish agency was not involved in any way in the decision about where these new immigrants would live or what kind of work they would do all the decisions on those subjects were apparently made by the rabbis
1393445 the community in lima consists of a certain socio economic class and did not want them because they are from a lower level there was a kind of agreement that if they were converted they would not join the lima community so there was no choice but to lay down the condition that they immigrate to israel
1393446 now thank god we live where the patriarch abraham the number one jew roamed
1393447 and since he was in peru many jews have been born there
1393448 they always say that about him in peru and he visited many places in peru and left jewish blood everywhere
1393449 there are also a lot of christian sects that obey the commandments since then when we were christians we also observed all kinds of commandments such as pascha sic and shavuot
1393450 no in peru everyone is a mixture of natives and all kinds of conquerors but there was a great deal of jewish influence through the marranos jews living during the spanish inquisition who secretly kept their faith despite converting to christianity and through columbus when we were still christians and went to the church we observed some commandments such as shabbat and holidays
1393451 because every year in the 1990s a rabbi named miron sover mendel came to peru at passover and he would always spend a few days in trujillo and a few days in cajamarca and a few days in lima and teach us judaism he died about half a year ago so when they asked me at the conversion about a name i asked in his memory that my surname be changed to mendel
1393452 the absorption ministry told us to go here and thank god they sent us here
1393453 this is the land of the patriarch abraham and the people here are very nice
1393454 the idea that there are palestinians here at all is a lie the palestinian people never existed and only when the jews leave their country the arabs come in and try to take over and prove they have a right here but we cannot agree to that because the lord gave the land to abraham isaac and jacob for all time and all the jews will be united and love the lord with all their heart and then all the problems will be solved
1393455 in peru i thought that all the jews in israel were religiously observant
1393456 it was only when i came here that i heard that almost 30 of the jews are not religious and that broke my heart
1393457 yes the majority but not everyone but if they all become fully religious and unite the messiah will come and the problems with the palestinians will be solved because they will get out of here
1393458 it will be the most wonderful day in the world when all the arabs will become jews and observe the commandments and love the lord and when the messiah comes there will be no one in the land of our fathers who does not love the lord and judaism with all their heart
1393459 but god said that whomsoever becomes a jew with a full heart and observes the commandments only to a jew like that will he give the land for generation unto generation
1393460 we knew we were coming to a place that is called territories because people we know immigrated earlier and are living in the settlements in the territories but i have no problem with that because i do not consider the territories to be occupied territories you cannot conquer what has in any case belonged to you since the time of the patriarch abraham
1393461 because i wasnt in the army in peru and that is something i lack and also because i want to defend the country and if there is no choice i will kill arabs but i am sure that jews kill arabs only for self defence and justice but arabs do it because they like to kill
1393462 the arab has the instinct of murder and killing like all gentiles and only jews do not have that instinct that is a genetic fact
1393463 maybe it was there but it makes no difference because now we are all jews
1393464 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
1393465 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
1393466 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
1393467 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
1393468 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
1393469 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
1393470 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
1393471 im too rich thus naive to bother myself with cutting ends
1393472 are at least as brainwashed by multiculturalism and political correctness as they ever were with communism
1393473 we let our guard down after the fall of the berlin wall and never properly denounced the ideology behind it
1393474 10 books that screwed up he world and 5 others that didnt help
1393475 the descent of man and selection in relation to sex
1393476 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1393477 how do you remain assertive and yet be considered a team player
1393478 how do you become a great leader and yet still be humble
1393479 im just about out of patience with the red tape endless committees and approval processes around here to get things done
1393480 how often do personal or individual agendas get in the way of progress on your team
1393481 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1393482 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1393483 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1393484 es cr ticamente importante para linux tener una forma f cil para que los desarrolladores puedan escribir c digo para una distribuci n n sea red hat ubuntu o novell
1393485 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1393486 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1393487 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1393488 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1393489 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1393490 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
1393491 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
1393492 i dont remember anyone talking about knowing they were being videotaped in those meetings but if you have the khadr videotape and this statement that seems pretty clear the question is did the u s destroy everything
1393493 interrogators from recognized human rights abusing regimes onto the u s military base
1393494 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist and that contrary to what the military says it was absolutely sop
1393495 i would be shocked if they had not been destroyed
1393496 i think theres no question if you invite someone in and they threaten them the person who invited them in should be held accountable
1393497 we will request any and all videotapes by u s and foreign intelligence services to find out what was being done to them and what threats were made against them
1393498 two thirds academic stuff im working on and one third politics
1393499 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
1393500 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
1393501 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
1393502 the last wave was this past week and now it got very quiet
1393503 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous
1393504 we always have human review before turning off an active blog
1393505 people invest so much time into their blogs to treat it with anything less than the utmost respect is criminal
1393506 im not sure i want a darkie leading this nation
1393507 what gives the pharmacist the right to refuse to fill her prescription
1393508 why should a birth control clinic be forced to employ a nurse who wont give out the pill
1393509 why cant she go to another drugstore or come back to the clinic another day
1393510 any procedures including prescription drugs that result in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
1393511 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1393512 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received
1393513 if you cannot engage young people and give complete horizons to their expectations and their dreams i dont know that there would be any future for palestine
1393514 we had hoped to complete our studies especially after we were granted the visas we were packing our bags
1393515 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this companies that have made big investments around the world
1393516 if his conviction stands the enron prosecutions were a success if it doesnt prosecutors will have a hard time convincing the public that they took the right approach
1393517 but its clear that the law is evolving in this area
1393518 whenever a court rules as the 5th circuit did regarding this issue we listen to that ruling
1393519 to be clear we vigorously oppose the defendants every accusation of prosecutorial misconduct
1393520 the bush team knew that if it failed to move aggressively on enron there would be a huge political price to pay
1393521 convictions a prosecutors battle against mafia killers drug kingpins and enron thieves
1393522 the enron business records were so voluminous and hard to decode we thought it could take years to determine what evidence was relevant
1393523 it would take the six of us more than a decade
1393524 we tried as hard as we could to do a thoughtful and conscientious job in a very difficult case
1393525 should not be read to suggest that no dishonest fraudulent wrongful or criminal act has occurred
1393526 the book is not finished as many of these issues continue to work their way through the courts
1393527 theyre trying to avoid being attacked for what some may call the excesses of the enron and other earlier corporate fraud matters
1393528 the government was very aggressive and they may have gone too far in their prosecution theories
1393529 we regulate very loosely then we have a crisis and we react strongly then we grow complacent again
1393530 beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental united states

1393532 if you dont calm down we will have to force you to calm down you dont want that do you
1393533 i asked you nicely now it is time to have a little enjoyment
1393534 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1393535 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1393536 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
1393537 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong
1393538 the next los angeles the struggle for a livable city

1393542 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
1393543 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
1393544 in todays culture is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was for those who brandished it most seriously a symbol of violence rhetorical political and literal against the united states it was the high sign for a racist militia the black panthers which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with americas enemies
1393545 the greatest threat to the internal security of the country
1393546 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
1393547 according to shiite tradition the twelve imams descendants of the prophet muhammads cousin and son in law ali ibn abi talib were endowed with divine qualities that enabled them to lead the shiite believers and to function as allahs emissaries on earth however when the twelfth imam muhammad al mahdi disappeared in 941 ce his connection with the shiite believers was severed and since then the shiites are commanded to await his return at any time
1393548 immediately upon assuming the presidency ahmadinejad began to assert his belief in the imminent return of the mahdi as the basis for his political activities
1393549 if there were just a hint more thinking like this in washington prosecuting and decisively winning the war on terror would not be the controversy some choose to make it at the cost of national security
1393550 the smart boys over at vital perspective always have their ears to the ground picking up the latest news in the middle east

1393556 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1393557 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1393558 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

1393568 going live with the a330 fleet is just one step in our move toward fleet wide implementation of the maintenix software
1393569 with quicker sign offs and features such as real time records and execution users were extremely receptive in a direct testament to the maintenix benefits seen by our a330 maintenance personnel the mechanics who work on other fleets have been asking when they will have maintenix too
1393570 the roll out of the maintenix software on klms a330 was quite smooth
1393571 a major factor in this success was the level of involvement by the klm team this was a very collaborative implementation we are looking forward to continuing our work together

1393687 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1393688 john mccain hes been in washington for 26 years and as gas prices soared and dependence on oil exploded mccain was voting against alternative energy against higher mileage standards
1393689 barack obama hell make energy independence an urgent national priority raise mileage standards fast track technology for alternative fuels a thousand dollar tax cut to help families as we break the grip of foreign oil a real plan and new energy
1393690 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1393691 hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1393692 and while senator mccains plan wont save you at the pump anytime soon it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars
1393693 so to sum up under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1393694 thats the choice we face in this election we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling thats what senator mccain is offering
1393695 or we can choose a new clean energy future that gets us where we need to be we can make a different bet a bet on the ingenuity industry and determination of the american people thats what im offering

1393699 well before senators barack obama and john mccain rose to the top of their parties a partisan shift was under way at the local and state level for more than three years starting in 2005 there has been a reduction in the number of voters who register with the republican party and a rise among voters who affiliate with democrats and almost as often with no party at all

1393826 mac users think that they dont need to worry about viruses and spyware
1393827 this is the one area where the mac doesnt have an advantage in security
1393828 significantly fewer mac users were using anti phishing technologies but they were pretty much identical to windows users about giving personal information

1393831 it could be because theres less of it out there or more people could be using security software or better software

1393887 today s youth spend untold hours playing violent video games
1393888 this addictive behavior is not confined to economic class or race it fosters dependence and social isolation
1393889 aside from the violence obscenity and negative themes the larger and greater problem lies in the fact that video games control many people s hearts and minds creating a monotonous zoned out new reality

1393895 eu acho que um filme inteiramente diferente mais uma hist ria de aventura do que um coment rio social eu diria que se existe uma maior dire o emocional que determina no filme tem a haver com o conceito de vingan a e o dano que o desejo de vingan a pode causar e eu tenho sido sempre interessado nisso como uma preocupa o eu acho que n s temos visto em nosso tempo v rias fac es pol ticas v rios l deres pol ticos que querem se vingar pelo que eles sentem ter sido atacados injustamente e o ciclo vai se repetindo se repetindo e n o para algu m tem de dizer vamos parar com isso porque estamos destruindo um ao outro ent o eu acho que de fato sigo o filme com este conceito

1393914 i bailed out wall street and all i got was this crappy mortgage
1393915 when scott almeida walked out of federal prison and into the mortgage business he took a gamble he admitted on his license application that he had been convicted of cocaine trafficking
1393916 people need to be aware of this and banks need to have better security
1393917 have some money left for a hammer and some paint
1393918 weve got to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
1393919 maybe the world is not as flat or small as it once seemed
1393920 companies looking to keep prices low will have to move some production closer to consumers
1393921 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
1393922 we are all saddened that the search efforts of the coast guard fire department police and marines came to this tragic end

1393925 this is a step in the right direction for the recovery of the sierra nevada bighorn sheep
1393926 the bighorn is a majestic creature threatened by extinction it desperately needs the safety net that critical habitat provides especially in light of growing threats to its survival including climate change domestic sheep grazing and damage from off road vehicles
1393927 with critical habitat in place the fish and wildlife service and forest service must now address these remaining threats
1393928 this designation places a clear mandate for the government to protect these lands for the recovery of the bighorn
1393929 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence
1393930 the woman is a ph d is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1393931 if she was carrying fluids and was considered dangerous then why was she left unattended in a room behind a curtain and this dangerous hardened criminal picks up a gun and misses
1393932 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1393933 everyone loved them and they are going to be missed so much
1393934 every person she was around their life was affected some way by her
1393935 if you didnt know mrs v there is no way you can possibly put to words what a great person she was

1393939 the side effects bible the dietary solution to unwanted side effects of common medications
1393940 this could be a big reason why we have what we call the walking wounded and why so many people on drug therapy are having so many problems
1393941 its very simple most doctors consider vitamins and nutrients a waste of time
1393942 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
1393943 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
1393944 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
1393945 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
1393946 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1393947 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1393948 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1393949 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1393950 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1393951 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
1393952 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
1393953 is love meant only for individuals who have a choice who can make decisions as they seem fit
1393954 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues
1393955 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1393956 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1393957 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1393958 her recovery will be a long process and she is getting all the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step of the way
1393959 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1393960 i think some of it is regional it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
1393961 to keep american women from having access to basic birth control
1393962 trying to use the guise of an existing conscience requirement to achieve
1393963 redefine abortion to include some of the most common forms of birth control
1393964 who expect their employees to give women full reproductive care
1393965 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
1393966 merely because the agency has an obligation to enforce existing conscience rules
1393967 allow employees to refuse to dispense birth control pills to women
1393968 religious right has only six months left in president bushs term to continue its war on science and its war on women
1393969 the latest sneak attack has been exposed congress has a duty to beat it back
1393970 bouncers and public health authorities there is wide acknowledgment that drug addiction and sexual activity are common among women who perform
1393971 theres a lot of drug use lots of oral vaginal sex going on in the clubs
1393972 its easy to lose sight of the fact that the news on aids is more good than bad
1393973 anger that the u s government seems more interested in fighting the disease overseas than among african americans at home
1393974 aids advocates have a tough time acknowledging good news because they dont want donor nations to get complacent
1393975 d onors and recipient countries are still doing plenty of things wrong
1393976 doing plenty right too and for that they deserve more credit than they usually get
1393977 this card opens up the conversation for people to talk about it
1393978 our goal is to make it easy for people to get this done
1393979 we have to fix this hiv aids epidemic with this we can start
1393980 storage of cord blood as biological insurance should be discouraged
1393981 eleventh hour intervention of aids activists and educators with the assistance of a few state lawmakers
1393982 stronger infrastructure of community based organizations vying for the funding
1393983 when you look at the proportion of services on the south side of hartford compared to the north side it doesnt break out evenly
1393984 we dont have a strong african american based agency advocating for services in the north end all that is going to rest on the entire community to take action
1393985 if it werent for the few watchdogs that we have the african american community would definitely fall off the radar there is a disparity in the accessibility and its our fault too there was a national mandate by the
1393986 im just duh eyeing to know which disney princess you are
1393987 so how do you categorize people who are divorced gay or lead not so perfect lifestyles
1393988 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1393989 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1393990 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1393991 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1393992 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1393993 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1393994 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1393995 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1393996 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1393997 i believe this process can help tens of millions of allergy asthma and sinus sufferers improve their health to my knowledge it is the first major breakthrough in treating indoor air quality problems and allergies in decades
1393998 we cant talk about that you must understand if we talk about it the police will come and arrest us
1393999 finding solutions no matter how extreme they may be is not an act of cowardice but its the right and the most practical way to approach the one element which people like us are most lookng for and that is
1394000 i was ready to just pay the bill and book them again lets try again next week when somebody said well i guess we better go cut something we ended up spending most of the night in there and got this album cut that night with the exception of a few songs

1394002 open question pisces asks for tips on how to organize
1394003 i dont see why people cant have their own ideas
1394004 he doesnt know thats ws truck you tell him elsa you tell these better than i do
1394005 the blue streak was an old military 2 seater truck he had he got it at an auction and thought he was all cool it was all rusted out around the windows just a big ol clunky truck with ripped seats and a double cab i dont mean space behind the seat i mean two actual full size seats four doors it was faded army colored with rust everywhere inside the cab outside too i guess
1394006 the truck was an abomination and w was teased at work which he got off on of course he left it that way until the novelty of the thing started to fade and this is when he decided to paint it with the leftover house paint
1394007 right well our mother was an artist and she knows paint so she tells him that you cant put house paint on metal never mind he plans to paint the truck with the paint brush
1394008 you mean hes going to paint the house and then walk outside and paint a truck with it
1394009 he was going to roll the paint onto the truck with a regular paint roller and then do the detail work with the paint brush but really the roller didnt work at all so he ended up painting the truck with the brush a muted light tan yellowish house paint color this is you could see the brush strokes all over the truck
1394010 so my mother comes out she can see him out there painting from her studio she tells him that the truck looks like shit she says it may help if he paints the bumper a different color so he obliges her by taking a can of spray paint and painting them red
1394011 so w comes home on friday night with three or five cans of blue spray paint he knows this works right spray paint works he says hes going to paint the truck again and this time hes going to do it right

1394013 thats what people ask him and thats what people ask me whats the matter with you people ask me that all the time and when they do thats when i know i am really me for sure
1394014 well he argued this in court he was stopped for going too slow on the freeway once and he went to court to fight the ticket he told the judge that although he was aware of the minimum speed on the highway he feared what may happen to his truck if he broke the rule so that is why he was going 43 mph and holding up traffic

1394019 over 95 of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
1394020 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
1394021 i think the new statistics are the most important aids story in the u s since the advent of the new treatments
1394022 stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with hiv and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
1394023 science based aids prevention means having access to accurate data about how many people are becoming infected
1394024 less and less money to actually get hiv prevention programs to the communities that need them
1394025 been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process
1394026 its important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects cdcs ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and secure a better understanding of the epidemic
1394027 fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected in the united states every year therefore these findings should be a wake up call that the epidemic in the united states is far from over
1394028 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
1394029 demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health
1394030 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
1394031 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
1394032 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
1394033 means little if it does not serve as the spark to inflame our collective anger about the deadly neglect of an acute emergency
1394034 there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies
1394035 confirm that aids in america is a black disease and has been neglected for far too long

1394040 social policy should probably be more orientated towards the problems associated with the fertility levels for specific groups rather than towards aggregate fertility levels
1394041 one for mum one for dad and one for the country
1394042 australia appears to be in a safe zone of fertility despite fertility levels being below replacement levels there is no fertility crisis
1394043 the report confirms the rudd governments commitment to ensuring payments and working arrangements support families choices
1394044 in the presence of even a small fraction of australias current net migration levels the sustainability of australias population is not at risk
1394045 indeed with current fertility rates australias population is projected to grow at the third highest rate among developed countries to 2051

1394050 this plan weakens tortoise protections and directs the service to study instead of stop the tortoises decline caused by threats like off road vehicles and livestock grazing
1394051 we already know what threatens the desert tortoise and the service should immediately act to reduce those threats this plan would speed up the tortoises slide toward extinction
1394052 under the proposed plan the fish and wildlife service is abandoning its legal responsibility to protect the desert tortoise by leaving the animals recovery up to local stakeholder groups that lack the scientific expertise to develop recovery strategies
1394053 desert tortoise recovery requires on the ground action but this plans focus is planning to plan the current recovery plan provides a science based roadmap to recovery but the administration has spent the last two years rewriting and weakening the plan because it finds recovery actions to be politically inconvenient
1394054 without an immediate course correction the administration is effectively pushing the tortoise to extinction
1394055 if an agent who was accredited by us encouraged and promoted a player to breach his contract and go overseas in similar circumstances to sonny bill wed probably go close to disbarring him and revoking his licence
1394056 it would be in breach of our code of conduct which requires all players to adhere to their side of the contract
1394057 we also had a university of nsw contract law expert deborah healey in who said facilitating a player breaching their contract that they too could be liable
1394058 the only way it could happen is if a private club owner over there thumbed his nose at the irb and the ffr
1394059 it would align us with the northern hemisphere wouldnt it
1394060 this company has a responsibility to provide prompt and accurate information about the chemicals it is storing
1394061 without this information state and local emergency responders cannot be adequately prepared to protect communities in the event of a chemical release
1394062 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1394063 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1394064 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein
1394065 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
1394066 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade
1394067 theres no question that rising gas prices are having a significant impact on the lives of consumers across the country
1394068 our survey shows the extent of the hardships consumers are experiencing as well as the concessions theyre making to off set these costs

1394070 i dont think its that i guess i look on it as there are very few opportunities like we have right now or the kerry campaign had found years ago so we just want to work every day to take advantage of that opportunity

1394076 continue to face discrimination isolation and criminalization for hiv transmission
1394077 the conference is a place to exchange opinion but now only those in power have a say
1394078 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1394079 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 percent of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1394080 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1394081 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 percent more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 percent of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 percent last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the u s economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1394082 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1394083 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1394084 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 percent during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 percent in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 percent this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150 percent
1394085 the impact of advanced technology on energy efficiency is even more dramatic
1394086 a recent independent study showed that computers have become nearly 3 million percent more energy efficient over the past 30 years
1394087 can cause hallucinations convulsions vomiting and in extreme cases death
1394088 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1394089 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1394090 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1394091 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1394092 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1394093 the idea of the caucus is to look at the refugee problem from a humanitarian perspective not to focus on why there are refugees but to look at solutions
1394094 the caucus is an attempt to conduct a dialogue with unrwa the un agency for palestinian refugees and not an attempt to force a solution
1394095 unrwa is performing a humanitarian task that we support even if there are some differences of opinion
1394096 by far the most protracted and largest of all the refugee problems in the world today
1394097 the unhcrs mandate does not extend to the majority of palestinian refugees by virtue of paragraph 7 c of the organizations statute which excludes persons who continue to receive from other organs or agencies of the united nations protection or assistance
1394098 because refugees have to be physically present in unrwas area of operations to benefit from its assistance stateless palestinian refugees living beyond that area get no assistance from the agency unrwa
1394099 the refugee agency does not deal with palestinian refugees in israel and the surrounding states a task handled by the u n relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east unrwa
1394100 it is more than a tad hypocritical for johnson to cite decision making transparency as the reason for airing opposition memos while he is dodging congressional subpoenas
1394101 reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries has been the focus for the international community since the united nations climate change conference in bali last december but this is also an issue for australia
1394102 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1394103 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the c02 released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the carbon stored in natural forests is a larger and more reliable stock than the carbon stored in commercially logged forests and plantations
1394104 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal
1394105 just as important in most countries stigma against people living with hiv remains a grave challenge
1394106 they are wonderfully courageous and motivated people and should serve as an example to us all on how to act with dignity in the face of adversity
1394107 that they should be discriminated against including through restrictions on their ability to travel between countries should fill us with shame
1394108 this is cause for encouragement but not cause for complacency nor for declaring victory
1394109 because the end of aids is nowhere in sight every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral treatment
1394110 some of the nuclear weapon free zone treaties have not yet entered into force several signatories have yet to complete the ratification or accession process whole regions have been unable to establish such zones including the middle east and some nuclear weapon states have not concluded the relevant protocols
1394111 clearly there is still much work to do before we achieve our shared goal of a nuclear weapon free world
1394112 id leaks a surprising source is your government at work
1394113 only a small portion of data breaches get publicized and with government data breaches even fewer get identified because the government unlike business doesnt have a financial incentive to do so
1394114 its very important that the government view citizens as their customers and place more value on sensitive information
1394115 these guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further recognising the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us
1394116 it is an important step forward in improving the coordination between military actors and humanitarian actors
1394117 we hope the guidelines will in the future avoid misunderstandings and the neutrality of humanitarian actors is better respected
1394118 oef forces are not routinely involved in development projects and therefore are not required to approve this guideline the majority of us forces are assigned to isaf nato and are in compliance with this guideline
1394119 we have no idea about these guidelines and were never part of the process which produced them we only respect truly neutral and independent aid organisations which do not work at the behest of american and western forces
1394120 government and humanitarian actors have the primary role of providing humanitarian assistance and the military is primarily responsible for providing security and if necessary basic infrastructure and urgent reconstruction assistance limited to gap filling measures until civilian organisations are able to take over
1394121 all humanitarian actors military actors and other security actors should at all times be respectful of international law and afghan laws culture and customs
1394122 humanitarian assistance must not be used for the purpose of political gain relationship building or winning hearts and minds
1394123 as all actors who have taken a proactive stance in support of the goa government of afghanistan including the un the eu european union isaf and other security forces are currently targets of armed opposition groups in afghanistan a distinction must be retained between the identities functions and roles of these entities and those actors who seek to preserve neutrality
1394124 a distinction must be retained between the identities functions and roles of the different actors to preserve our neutrality
1394125 the story is one of abject failure on the part of the institutions that have been charged with leading the response to hiv aids at local national and international levels
1394126 men who have sex with men continue to have little or no access to hiv services of any kind and as a result are plagued by high rates of infection
1394127 these epidemics are happening in countries where men who have sex with men are hidden highly stigmatised populations it is not just family and community stigma it is also legal stigma
1394128 more than 80 countries still have laws criminalising these behaviours at least nine still have the death penalty for same sex behaviour
1394129 there is an urgent need to respond to this yet there is endless denial out there that these epidemics exist and as a result they are seriously underfunded
1394130 none of the men who tested positive to hiv during the study knew they were positive
1394131 is reminiscent of what was happening in western countries such as the us and australia in the 1980s
1394132 in just about every major asian city for which we have data theres been a significant increase of hiv among men who have sex with men
1394133 for the 1 million people newly on treatment there were 2 7 million newly infected thats nearly 7500 people infected with hiv every day
1394134 we need to keep focused on injecting drug users and sex workers but we also need to increase resources to men who have sex with men
1394135 in most concentrated epidemics we shouldnt be spending too much money on the general population who are at low risk
1394136 globally we have been a bit slow to realise that
1394137 over the last few decades younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having these postponed babies so called recuperation
1394138 recuperation has almost certainly been a major driver of the increase in fertility
1394139 there is no current or looming impending fertility crisis in australia
1394140 i play a character who checks out customers at the register
1394141 i face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation

1394144 before you settle in it seems there is a problem we have never had a high official from malaysia you see so were not sure what to do with you
1394145 well id like to but i have orders from higher up what well do is have you spend one day in hell and one day in heaven after that you can choose where to spend eternity
1394146 really i have made up my mind i want to be in heaven
1394147 well then youve spent a day in hell and another in heaven now choose your eternity
1394148 well i would never have said this before i mean heaven has been delightful but i think ai yam better off in hell
1394149 yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse and we ate lobster and caviar drank champagne danced and had a great time now theres just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable what happened
1394150 yesterday we were campaigning just like you did during a malaysian election today you have voted
1394151 there are no more excuses internet service providers can no longer drag their feet when it comes to protecting children and purging this deplorable and illegal material from their servers
1394152 we are sending a message in long island and across the nation that companies who do not adopt these sensible reforms and make a commitment to fight online child pornography will hear from my office
1394153 the insurance department has directed cdphp and ubi to contact all members who were denied claims in situations where the companies failed to provide explanation of benefits eob notices or provided inadequate eob information
1394154 these notices are required by law and they give consumers important information regarding coverage under insurance policies for example an eob spells out how a claim has been processed what costs are covered by the insurer what costs must be paid by the member and specifically what steps a consumer can take to appeal the denial of a claim
1394155 the right to appeal the denial of claims is one of the most important protections that consumers have today but it isnt as meaningful if people are not told of their rights by the company this is yet another example of how important it is for vigorous consumer protection in the private insurance marketplace we also support the insurance department in its efforts to reinstate prior approval of health insurance rates

1394202 now whether they are drilling on the coast of cuba or offshore less than 60 miles from florida
1394203 it doesnt change the fact that the communists in china understand the laws of supply and demand more than the democrats

1394209 comparing the dpj to the nazis is a verbal abuse that completely lacks common sense
1394210 i only tried to raise a question about the absence of proper discussion in the upper house
1394211 i was trying to explain that there have been many such cases in the past after parliamentary discussions were boycotted
1394212 there were similar cases before world war ii and thats what i used as an example
1394213 in the past germany invited tragedy by letting the nazis take power
1394214 the best country in the world would be a country where the richest jewish people would want to live

1394252 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1394253 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1394254 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1394255 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1394256 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1394257 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1394258 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1394259 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1394260 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1394261 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1394262 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1394263 we are not happy with the verdicts we will appeal
1394264 being here is great but this wasnt the real show

1394271 our goal in the olympics is to try and beat new zealand

1394279 borrowed from a bioweapons lab that fall freeze drying equipment that allows scientists to quickly convert wet germ cultures into dry spores
1394280 the drying device known as a lyopholizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1394281 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1394282 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
1394283 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual
1394284 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way

1394320 during a down economy and particularly when combined with the foreclosure crisis and rapidly rising energy costs both managers and employees may be feeling increasing stress
1394321 under these circumstances tempers may be shorter and statements may be interpreted in ways that confirm pre existing fears

1394326 i recently worked with a team where the manager was perceived as getting colder when in fact the director was just pushing for more output but wasnt messaging it properly

1394466 day after day we were trained for rushing forward and attacking the enemys tanks loading up large numbers of bombs with our bodies as i was already certain of japanese defeat i knew how senseless it was i was always seeking ways to survive though of course i never uttered a single word about it i and my comrades never wanted to die for the emperor even though we respected him i just wanted to listen to violin music played by heyfetz

1394476 when new moms suffer in silence with depression often for a long time before getting help everyone loses
1394477 patients dont always recognize they are suffering from ppd and may think its a normal part of pregnancy and becoming a new mom symptoms such as mood swings anxiety and depression are common symptoms of ppd unfortunately even if they do recognize theres a problem moms dont always know where to turn for help our goal with ppd screening is to provide support and awareness to mothers and families as well as to identify risks and refer them for clinical evaluation at earlier stages when needed
1394478 as more health plans and employers begin offering matrias new ppd screening services to their members and employees we look forward to the opportunity to positively impact the lives of moms suffering from this treatable but often ignored medical condition
1394479 hell be different to michael because hes a different man michael had his style and that was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important
1394480 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1394481 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1394482 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1394483 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1394484 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team
1394485 to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area

1394500 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1394501 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1394502 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1394503 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1394504 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1394505 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1394506 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1394507 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1394508 why are we paying good money for a training system over which we have no control
1394509 i looked out the window and saw the car flipping head over end
1394510 i think what you have here is you have the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa florida
1394511 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1394512 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this
1394513 i told him it was something i wanted to do and he supported it it was a great relief
1394514 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1394515 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1394516 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1394517 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
1394518 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1394519 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1394520 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1394521 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1394522 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1394523 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1394524 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1394525 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1394526 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1394527 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1394528 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1394529 i dont believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook cleaner or shopper and i dont believe the man must be the breadwinner i wouldnt mind staying at home while catherine works
1394530 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence
1394531 the woman is a ph d is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims

1394550 most of these non profits such as 995 hope and hope now are funded by lenders and servicers so how can they possibly have the consumers best interests at heart
1394551 over 80 of the mortgages we audit have predatory lending and legal violations
1394552 if these violations are found then the borrower may be eligible for complete relief of the predatory loan or a very favorable loan modification
1394553 the most common option is just to mediate the loan with your lender and fight for an affordable based on the legal violations on the loan we have had rates approved as low as 2
1394554 the homeowner has their loan fixed and may have their principle balance may be reduced also the lender does not lose their shirt because they have mediated the matter without employing their full legal staff on the file and wasting precious operating expenses

1394622 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention

1394666 northern rock said they wouldnt offer me a new deal and if i couldnt find one at another bank id go on to their variable rate
1394667 i think the brand as an entity is dead why would you invest in northern rock if you have similar product in another high street bank were seeing fewer and fewer customers going to northern rock the future does not look good for the bank
1394668 northern rock has to be the safest bank in europe if not the world its backed by one of the worlds largest economies so if safety is what you seek northern rock is the place to be
1394669 i believe the mortgage book the retails book and a variety of other assets will be sold because there is value within this organisation there is just no value within the brand itself
1394670 it looks quite scary at a first glance but theyve actually paid back 9bn which is impressive
1394671 northern rock could have closed but it didnt it is still in business even when they make the 1 300 redundancies later this month there will still be something in the region of 4 000 employed and another 12 000 to 15 000 people whose incomes rely on their spending power this is a big deal for the north east
1394672 im impatient to get things done and i dont suffer fools gladly
1394673 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
1394674 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
1394675 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
1394676 more than 70 percent of the worlds purchasing power is outside the united states
1394677 through our combined resources we recognize that we can more effectively promote u s exports and improve the countrys competitive advantage in global trade
1394678 one county is in favor of it one county is against it
1394679 weve had letters saying were going to drop you as members of the wisconsin towns association the next one wants us to support it
1394680 our first place ranking amongst the largest airlines for on time performance for the first half of 2008 validates the remarkable turnaround our airline has achieved over the past year
1394681 our customers tell us that getting to their destination on time is very important and our 35 000 employees are doing their part to make sure that happens
1394682 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1394683 it definitely was a high quality game but we still have a long way to go
1394684 tonight was a chance to see where we stand and i look forward to seeing them again
1394685 being here is great but this wasnt the real show
1394686 it was like an audition for the olympics we passed the pre olympic test but now were going to go and take care of business
1394687 this is rehearsal now were getting ready for the big game
1394688 i dont think there has every been a game when we played australia when it wasnt physical
1394689 ive been to three olympics games and this diamond ball is by far the best in terms of preparation
1394690 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1394691 this was a great tournament for us in terms of our preparation and i couldnt have asked for more
1394692 what motivates me the most is the chance to make history in brazilian football and win this first gold medal
1394693 we all know that if we win this medal we will make history its an unprecedented title
1394694 its a very important competition just as important to us the world cup and other big tournaments
1394695 very few players have an opportunity to participate in two olympics and im glad im having this chance to win what we let slip away in the past
1394696 every time a professional player changes teams and plays in an important competition its a new start
1394697 im very happy with these opportunities and im motivated to do my best
1394698 its a special moment in my career and i hope ill be able to do my best here
1394699 we need a good start to put us on the right track for the rest of the olympics
1394700 aku mengirimkan surat ini kepadamu karena aku merasa surat ini pantasuntuk disebar luaskan sebab surat ini menjelaskan sampai sejauh mana bencana yang menimpa sebagian gadis di bawah slogan emansipasi dan pacaran
1394701 aku dulu hidup dengan penuh kebebasan sampai sampai aku memiliki hubungan dengan para pemuda tetangga dan aku membujuk mereka untuk berbicara denganku dan aku berlemah lembut kepada mereka
1394702 the rising of phenomenon of men using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families
1394703 the destruction of the entrance deprived those inside the tunnel of oxygen
1394704 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1394705 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1394706 im sure this will be the most spread of medals that weve ever seen at an olympic games
1394707 traditionally a lot of time at world championship level its been between australia and america but i dont think thats going to be the case this time were going to see a lot of other counties step up
1394708 weve got to remember that there are so many other countries theres japan were here in china they have a strong contingent and certainly europe that are going to eat into that medal tally
1394709 i think we had a really really strong team this year
1394710 were focusing on ourselves and what we need to do as a team and make sure that individually we get the performances
1394711 what any other team may be doing and what treatment they get is not a worry nor a focus for us
1394712 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1394713 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1394714 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1394715 its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1394716 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1394717 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1394718 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1394719 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1394720 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1394721 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1394722 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1394723 in the future we need to be more hands on and pro active on issues that engage our image and credibility
1394724 it is heavily image based we cannot allow to be hijacked by pressure groups and vested interests
1394725 the games must be read within the context of each nation
1394726 we are being hosted by the chinese the ioc and the olympic movement should not be expected to resolve issues which are not related to the athletic competition we would compromise our mission and responsibility if we tried to resolve all problems unrelated to the games
1394727 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1394728 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1394729 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1394730 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1394731 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1394732 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1394733 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1394734 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight

1394801 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1394802 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1394803 ta da here are the perfect standards for reconciling the goals of privacy and information sharing
1394804 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law

1394812 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1394813 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1394814 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1394815 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1394816 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1394817 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1394818 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1394819 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1394820 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1394821 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1394822 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

1394827 columbus ohio a death row inmate scheduled for execution says hes too fat to be put to death claiming executioners would have trouble finding his veins and that his weight could diminish the effectiveness of one of the lethal injection drugs
1394828 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1394829 cyclists have equal rights but in fact a lot of motorists think they should get off the road
1394830 when were used to seeing more cyclists we will treat them better
1394831 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1394832 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1394833 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1394834 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1394835 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1394836 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1394837 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1394838 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1394839 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1394840 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1394841 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1394842 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1394843 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1394844 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

1394846 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

1394848 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

1394850 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1394851 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1394852 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

1394856 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1394857 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1394858 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

1394861 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1394862 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1394863 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1394864 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1394865 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1394866 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1394867 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1394868 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1394869 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1394870 so pena de verse abocado a la misma situaci n que sufri el irak de sadam husein
1394871 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1394872 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1394873 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1394874 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1394875 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

1394917 dan janganlah kamu mendekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu adalah suatu perbuatan yang keji dan suatu jalan yang buruk
1394918 di dalam larangan dari mendekati zina dengan cara melakukan pengantar pengantarnya terdapat larangan dari zina secara utama karena sarana menuju sesuatu jika ia haram maka tujuan tentunya haram menurut konteks hadits
1394919 allah tidak menghendaki menyulitkan kalian tetapi dia hendak membersihkan kalian dan menyempurnakan nikmat nya bagi kalian supaya kalian bersyukur
1394920 jika datang seorang lelaki yang melamar anak gadismu yang engkau ridhoi agama dan akhlaknya maka nikahkanlah ia

1394923 diantara berkahnya seorang wanita memudahkan urusan nikah nya dan sedikit maharnya
1394924 makna ucapan ini dibencinya memperbanyak mahar hubungannya dengan kondisi calon suami
1394925 ingatlah jangan kalian berlebih lebihan dalam memberikan mahar kepada wanita karena sesungguhnya jika hal itu adalah suatu kemuliaan di dunia dan ketaqwaan di akhirat maka nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam adalah orang yang palimg berhak dari kalian
1394926 ada tiga orang yang wajib bagi allah untuk menolongnya orang yang berperang di jalan allah budak yang ingin membebaskan dirinya dan orang menikah yang ingin menjaga kesucian diri
1394927 agama adalah mudah dan tidak seorangpun yang mempersulit dalam agama ini kecuali ia akan terkalahkan
1394928 permudahlah dan jangan kalian mempersulit berilah kabar gembira dan jangan kalian membuat orang lari
1394929 kalau sekiranya manusia mencukupkan dengan mahar yang kecil mereka saling tolong menolong dalam hal mahar yakni tidak mempersulit dan masing masing orang melaksanakan masalah ini niscaya masyarakat akan mendapatkan kebaikan yang banyak kemudahan yang lapang serta penjagaan yang besar baik kaum lelaki maupun wanitanya
1394930 syirik itu adalah seorang meyakini bahwa selain allah ada yang mencipta memberi rezqi menghidupkan mematikan mengetahui perkara gaib mengatur alam atau seorang mengarahkan sejenis diantara jenis jenis ibadah kepada selain allah seperti ruku sujud menyembelih bernadzar berdoa dan lainnya syirik seperti ini mengeluarkan pelakunya dari agama
1394931 itulah petunjuk allah yang dengannya dia memberi petunjuk kepada siapa yang dikehendaki nya diantara hamba hamba nya seandainya mereka menyekutukan allah niscaya lenyaplah dari mereka amalan yang telah mereka kerjakan
1394932 andaikan para nabi alaihish sholatu was salam berbuat syirik sekalipun mereka memiliki keutamaan dan kedudukan mereka tinggi maka amalan mereka akan hancur mereka akan sama dengan yang lainnya dalam kehancuran amalan amalan mereka disebabkan gugurnya pahala amalan itu
1394933 sesungguhnya yang paling bertaqwa dan paling mengetahui allah di antara kalian adalah aku
1394934 sesungguhnya rasulullah shollallahu alaihi wasallam biasa melakukan shalat malam sehingga telapak kakinya pecah pecah
1394935 kenapa anda melakukan hal ini wahai rasulullah bukankah allah telah memberikan ampunan kepadamu atas dosa dosa anda yang telah lalu dan yang akan datang
1394936 apakah aku tidak senang menjadi seorang hamba yang banyak bersyukur
1394937 dan sesungguhnya telah diwahyukan kepadamu dan kepada nabi sebelummu jika kamu baerbuat syirik niscaya akan terhapuslah amalanmu dan tentulah kamu termasuk orang orang yang merugi
1394938 dan barang siapa yang menyekutukan allah maka seolah olah ia jatuh dari langit kemudian ia disambar oleh burung atau diterbangkan oleh angin ke tempat yang jauh
1394939 barang siapa yang meninggalkan keimanan maka ia ibarat sesuatu yang jatuh dari langit besar kemungkinan ia mendapatkan penyakit dan bala entah ia disambar burung lalu ia tercabik cabik berantakan demikian seorang yang berbuat kesyirikan jika ia tak mau berpegang dengan keimanan maka ia akan disambar oleh setan dari segala sisi setan akan mencabik cabiknya dan akan menghilangkan agama dan dunianya
1394940 ingatlah hanya kepunyaan allah lah agama yang bersih dari syirik
1394941 sesungguhnya allah akan memutuskan di antara mereka tentang apa yang mereka perselisihkan sesungguhnya allah tidak menunjuki orang orang yang pendusta dan sangat ingkar
1394942 katakanlah wahai muhammad apakah akan kami kabarkan kepadamu tentang orang orang yang paling merugi amalannya yaitu orang orang yang telah sia sia perbuatannya dalam kehidupan dunia ini sedangkan mereka menyangka bahwa mereka telah perbuat sebaik baiknya mereka itu orang orang yang kufur terhadap ayat ayat rob mereka dan kufur terhadap perjumpaan dengan dia maka terhapuslah amalan amalan mereka dan kami tidak mengadakan suatu penilaian bagi amalan mereka pada hari kiamat
1394943 dan apakah orang yang sudah mati kemudian kami hidupkan dan kami berikan kepadanya cahaya yang terang yang dengan cahaya itu dia dapat berjalan di tengah tengah manusia serupa dengan orang yang keadaannya berada dalam gelap gulita yang sekali kali tidak dapat keluar dari padanya demikianlah kami jadikan orang yang kafir itu memandang baik apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
1394944 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni selain dari dosa syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendakinya
1394945 tak ada khilaf di antara kaum muslimin bahwa seorang yang berbuat syirik jika ia mati di atas kesyirikan maka ia bukanlah termasuk orang berhak mendapatkan ampunan yang allah anugrahkan kepada orang yang tidak berbuat syirik sebagaimana yang dituntut oleh kehendak nya
1394946 dan ingatlah ketika luqman berkata kepada anaknya diwaktu ia memberi pelajaran kepadanya
1394947 aku bertanya kepada nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam dosa apakah yang paling besar di sisi allah
1394948 kamu menjadikan sekutu bagi allah padahal dia yang telah mencipatakan kamu
1394949 sesungguhnya orang yang mempersekutukan allah maka pasti allah akan mengharamkan baginya surga dan tempat kembalinya ialah neraka tidalah ada bagi orang orang yang dholim itu seorang penolong pun
1394950 tatkala kesyirikan kepada allah meniadakan maksud penciptaan ini maka syirik menjadi dosa besar yang paling besar secara mutlak allah telah mengharamkan surga bagi setiap pelaku syirik dia halalkan darah harta dan keluarganya bagi orang yang bertauhid allah halalkan orang bertauhid menjadikan mereka sebagai budaknya karena mereka tidak melaksanakan tugas peribadahan kepada allah allah subhanahu enggan untuk menerima amalan seorang yang berbuat syirik enggan menerima syafaat atau menerima doa mereka di akhirat enggan menerima maaf mereka
1394951 dan penduduk neraka memanggil penduduk surga tuangkanlah air kepada kami atau dari apa apa yang allah telah rezkikan kepada kalian
1394952 sesungguhnya allah telah mengharamkan keduanya bagi orang orang yang kafir

1394961 most of the individuals approached by private insurers were existing lic customers but ask them what made them buy insurance and the reply is for tax purposes the need for insuring ones life after evaluating the growing requirements over a period of time was never felt
1394962 today it is observed that either most of the prospects we have approached are underinsured or the risk covers bought by them do not suit their needs
1394963 instead of pushing policies down the throat we educate the customer and offer guidance on how much insurance the individual needs an approach that is slowly paying off

1394979 r ather we opt for a more flexible approach that seeks to achieve substantial justice in light of the realities of the relationship it is the promise to support expressed or implied coupled with a marital type relationship that are indispensable elements to support a valid claim for palimony

1394983 the only question at the end of the day is how much money will debra opri be paying me

1395000 this album is me getting through a divorce getting dropped from a label and dealing with all of that frustration and pain
1395001 when i put this album together i wasnt going to let anybody tell me what to put on it or what not to put on it this wasnt going to be an album i did for commercial purposes it was going to be an album to reach that guy that was going through the same things i was
1395002 its a throwback to back when waylon and those guys were all doing their spontaneous albums
1395003 he lives out there on the edge a little bit but i remember when i worked for mel tillis he told me that if a songwriter wasnt crazy he didnt want him in his office
1395004 i was ready to just pay the bill and book them again lets try again next week when somebody said well i guess we better go cut something we ended up spending most of the night in there and got this album cut that night with the exception of a few songs
1395005 man it was a spiritual thing for all of us
1395006 i was in the throes of that divorce through the whole process of working that first single
1395007 it just got out of hand and i probably wasnt paying attention to the things that i needed to pay attention to one of those things was my family thats the sad reality
1395008 im not sure it would have worked out any better had i come off the road and just worked on putting my family back together id probably still end up without a record deal and without my family so i think i did the best i could do given the circumstances sometimes that is not in gods plan i dont regret my time at rca one bit
1395009 they really put me on their backs and carried me through a dark period in my life
1395010 they kept my name out there on the radio they kept my music out there and they kept me wanting to do it
1395011 i was having success as a songwriter but i had failed as an artist and as a husband
1395012 i felt like i was in the middle of a tornado or just on the tail end of one and it just went through destroying everything that i had
1395013 at the same time heres a blessing in the midst of that
1395014 man i just watched the songs having the success that they did and i thought somebody out there wants to hear what i have to say about something especially in this time right now going through the things that i am so i just started to put the pen to paper well if you like give it away heres the next level and heres the next level and it just kept going through one emotion after another until finally i had felt like i had covered the whole process
1395015 i guess it just kind of focused everything down to the basics for me
1395016 i really didnt need a big place i didnt want 4 000 square feet of lonely just a little 800 square feet was probably about all the lonely i could stand
1395017 i think this album shows you that too it starts off really dark almost morbid and immediately cuts away to a vacation song and then some anger and frustration
1395018 as you go along through the album you go along through the whole process with me until by the end of the album everything is all good again and were back out on the road doing our thing

1395034 christ was begotten by an immortal father in the same way that mortal men are begotten my mortal fathers
1395035 god the father is a perfected glorified holy man and immortal personage and christ was born into the world as the literal son of this holy being he was born in the same personal real and literal sense that any mortal son is born to a mortal father there is nothing figurative about his paternity he was begotten conceived and born in the normal and natural course of events for he is the son of god and that disgnation means what it says

1395066 in june there were 12 000 more workers in alberta bringing total gains for the province during the past six months to 47 000 2 5 first half of 2007 occurred in a number of industries including trade business building and other support services construction and natural resources the employment gain in june the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3 8 as more people entered the labour force the participation rate for the province at 74 2 attained a new record in june and continued to be above that of all other provinces
1395067 alberta posts the best job gains in 25 years it is absolutely phenomenal performance what were looking at here is the best jobs performance in this province in 25 years whats even more astounding is that every one of these jobs were full time positions these were all top quality jobs 11 000 new oil and gas jobs 13 000 new professional science and technical positions and more than 10 000 new construction jobs in alberta in 2006
1395068 this is the best spot to invest to ensure albertas success diversification is the key and that is being recognized in 1985 36 of the gdp was dedicated to the energy sector in 2004 the same sector represented only 24 of the gdp
1395069 were simply running out of conventional oil the conventional wells are just going dry so the only game in town is non conventional and as a result we are seeing firms shifting in the oil patch to the oil sands

1395080 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself

1395095 aku pernah mendapatkan dalam sebagian kitab kitab suatu ungkapan yang berbunyi
1395096 ungkapan ini tak benar dari segi maknanya karena allah dialah sang maha pencipta segala sesuatu dan pemiliknya

1395106 tak akan baik akhir ummat ini kecuali dengan sesuatu yang memperbaiki awalnya
1395107 tak ada aibnya orang yang menampakkan madzhab salaf dan menisbahkan diri kepadanya dan mengasalkan diri kepadanya bahkan wajib menerima hal itu darinya menurut kesepakatan ulama karena madzhab salaf tidak ada kecuali benar
1395108 apa pekerjaan pokok yang menyatukan mereka dan dengannya mereka dikenali
1395109 jawab tugas utama mereka adalah mengklasifikasikan manusia berdasarkan hawa nafsu dan was was itulah yang menjadi kesibukan di setiap majelis dan tempat tempat berkumpul mereka 14 serta menjadi pekerjaan rutin mereka dengan segala kesungguhan dan potensi diri yang dimiliki tanpa memandang orang selainnya itu baik

1395120 orang orang yang bersilat lidah demi mengingkari naqd bantahan terhadap kebatilan walaupun sebagian diantara mereka nampak kesholehan tapi semua ini adalah bentuk lemahnya semangat kurang memahami kebenaran
1395121 orang yang terdiam dari kebenaran adalah setan bisu orang yang berbicara dengan kebatilan adalah setan yang berbicara
1395122 kita bersatu dalam perkara yang kita sepakati dan saling memaafkan dalam perkara yang kita perselisihkan
1395123 apakah para pelaku kebatilan itu mau diam afar kita juga bisa diam ataukah mereka menyerang aqidah di depan mata dan pendengaran kita lalu kita diminta diam ya allah ini tak mungkin
1395124 kamu kira mereka itu bersatu sedang hati mereka berpecah belah yang demikian itu karena sesungguhnya mereka adalah kaum yang tidak mengerti
1395125 mereka satu sama lain selalu tidak melarang tindakan munkar yang mereka perbuat
1395126 oleh karena ini jika anda melihat ada orang yang membantah
1395127 manusia masing masing memiliki kemampuan dan bakat 29 sedang membantah kebatilan adalah wajib bagi setiap orang pent walaupun bagaimana tingkatannya setiap muslim berada dalam batas pertahanan agamanya
1395128 jika kau diam dan aku juga diam maka siapakah yang akan memberitahukan seorang yang jahil bahwa ini yang benar dan ini yang sakit salah
1395129 seandainya allah tidak menolak keganasan sebahagian umat manusia dengan sebagian yang lain pasti rusaklah bumi ini tetapi allah mempunyai karunia yang dicurahkan atas semesta alam
1395130 dan sekiranya allah tiada menolak keganasan sebagian manusia dengan sebagian yang lain tentulah telah dirobohkan biara biara nasrani gereja gereja rumah rumah ibadat orang yahudi dan masjid masjid yang di dalamnya banyak disebut nama allah sesungguhnya allah pasti menolong orang yang menolong agama nya sesungguhnya allah benar benar maha kuat lagi maha perkasa

1395133 ia ibn sina adalah pemimpin para filsuf islam dan sejak kematian al farabi tidak pernah ada lagi yang semisal dengannya maka alhamdulillah atas keberkahan islam dan sunnah
1395134 aku tidak mengetahui ia memiliki riwayat apapun dalam ilmu islam dan jika pun ada tidak diizinkan meriwayatkan darinya karena ia adalah filsuf sesat yang menyimpang

1395151 dan tiadalah yang diucapkannya muhammad itu menurut hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanyalah wahyu yang diwahyukan
1395152 maka ilmuilah bahwasanya tiada sesembahan yang berhak disembah selain allah dan mohonlah ampunan bagi dosamu
1395153 ilmu itu jika ditegakkan sebelum ucapan dan amal maka akan diberkahi pelakunya biarpun perkaranya itu kecil adapun jika ucapan dan amal didahulukan sebelum ilmu dan bisa jadi perkaranya itu sebesar gunung namun itu semua tidaklah di atas jalan keselamatan dan sungguh amalan yang sebesar dzarah setitik namun didasari ilmu maka ini lebih besar nilainya daripada amalan laksana gunung tanpa ilmu dan bahwasanya ilmu itu tujuan puncak yang terpenting dan harus diutamakan dari segala sesuatu khususnya ilmu yang dapat memperbaiki ibadah meluruskan aqidah memperbaiki hati dan yang bisa menjadikan seseorang itu mudah dalam kehidupannya untuk meniti jalan di atas bukti nyata yang mencocoki sunnah rasul bukan hidup di atas kebodohan
1395154 al imam al bukhari berdalil dengan ayat ini muhammad 16 atas wajibnya mengawali dengan ilmu sebelum berkata dan beramal dan ini merupakan dalil atsari yang berdasarkan periwayatan yang menunjukkan atas insan bahwa berilmu terlebih dahulu baru kemudian beramal setelahnya sebagai langkah kedua dan juga di sana ada dalil aqliyah yang telah diteliti yang menunjukkan atas ilmu sebelum berkata dan beramal hal itu karena perkataan dan amalan tidak akan benar dan diterima sehingga perkataan dan amalan tersebut mencocoki syariat dan manusia tidaklah mungkin mengetahui bahwa amalnya mencocoki syariat kecuali dengan ilmu
1395155 al imam al bukhari memaksudkan dengan kesimpulannya itu bahwa ilmu merupakan syarat atas kebenaran suatu perkataan dan amalan maka suatu perkataan dan amalan itu tidak akan teranggap kecuali dengan ilmu oleh sebab itulah ilmu didahulukan atas ucapan dan perbuatan
1395156 ilmu yang wajib ain untuk dituntut adalah yang akan menegakkan agama seseorang beliau ditanya contohnya seperti apa jawabnya yaitu yang seseorang tidak boleh jahil bodoh tidak tahu dalam urusan shalatnya puasanya dan sejenisnya
1395157 dan allah mengeluarkan kamu dari perut ibumu dalam keadaan tidak mengetahui sesuatupun dan dia memberi kamu pendengaran penglihatan dan hati agar kamu bersyukur
1395158 siapa yang menempuh sebuah jalan dalam rangka untuk mencari ilmu maka allah akan memudahkan baginya jalan menuju jannah surga
1395159 niscaya allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman di antaramu dan orang orang yang berilmu beberapa derajat
1395160 siapa yang allah kehendaki kebaikan baginya allah akan memfaqihkannya memahamkan dalam agama
1395161 cukup derajat ini menunjukkan satu kebanggaan dan kemuliaan dan martabat ini adalah martabat yang tinggi dan agung sebagaimana tidak ada kedudukan yang tinggi daripada kedudukan nubuwwah kenabian begitu juga tidak ada kemuliaan di atas kemuliaan pewaris nabi
1395162 katakanlah ya muhammad apakah sama orang orang yang mengetahui berilmu dengan orang yang tidak mengetahui jahil
1395163 apakah orang yang mengetahui bahwasanya apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari rabbmu adalah al haq kebenaran sama dengan orang yang buta tidak mengetahui al haq
1395164 allah subhanahu wataala menolak disamakannya ahlul ilmi dengan selain mereka sama halnya sebagaimana allah subhanahu wataala menolak persamaan penghuni al jannah surga dengan penghuni an nar neraka
1395165 tidak sama antara penghuni an nar dengan penghuni al jannah

1395185 the artists invited for this exhibition are characterized not only by their strong personal vision and artistic practice but also their strong understanding and exploration of the world around them it is this understanding that imparts the clearer understanding of the gap that gives irony to their works that provide a truer vision of the world

1395187 it is a subterranean dualism between that which receives the action of the idea and that which eludes the action it is not the distinction between the model and the copy but rather between copies and simulacra pure becoming the unlimited is the matter of the simulacrum insofar as it eludes the action of the idea and insofar as it contests both model and copy at once
1395188 affairs quantities qualities are contrasted with an extra being which constitutes the incorporeal as a nonexisting entity the highest term therefore is not being but something insofar as it subsumes being and non being existence and inherence
1395189 it is a two sided entity equally present in the signifying and the signified series it is the mirror thus it is at once word and thing name and object sense and denotatum expression and designation etc
1395190 the technocrat is the natural friend of the dictator computers and dictatorship by the revolutionary lives in the gap which separates technical progress from social totality and inscribes there his dream of permanent revolution this dream therefore is itself action reality and an effective menace to all established order it renders possible what it dreams about
1395191 events are ideal the distinction however is not between two sorts of events rather it is between the event which is ideal by nature and its spatio temporal realization in a state of affairs the distinction is between event and accident events are ideational singularities which communicate in one and the same event they have therefore an eternal truth and their time is never the present which realizes them and makes them exist rather it is the unlimited aion the infinitive in which they subsist and insist 61 thus the time of the present is always a limited but infinite time infinite because cyclical animating a physical eternal return as the return of the same

1395219 an attempt has been made to give a bible which is more relevant for india there is nothing added or subtracted from the text of the bible which has been reproduced as such
1395220 we cannot simply have a re reproduction of the bible people must be able to assimilate and appreciate the bible the texts of the bible must come alive
1395221 but actually for us christ is the light we can use it as a prayer of divine light which illumines the human mind
1395222 for so many centuries we have not been able to read the text of the sacred scripture without indian traditions at the background our sacred text also must become meaningful to indians of different religions it will help to project our bible in their context
1395223 one of the most painful aspects of muslim demographic warfare is the open attempt by muslims to grab non muslim girls to use them for their own demographic ambitions meanwhile also inflicting a good dose of humiliation on the accursed kafirs

1395270 while we have seen very little benefit from these prices thus far in 2008 due to lower priced contracts that were signed in 2006 and 2007 we believe that our shareholders will begin to see the benefits during the remaining months of 2008 and a much greater benefit beginning in early 2009

1395278 the stakes in this election are bigger than any one person and voters in our district deserve to have a democratic candidate on the ballot this november who can overcome the politics of personal attack

1395300 blogs are a good way to make things happen indirectly
1395301 ad sales is a very different business than content production
1395302 it was fun to play and its extremely supportive but distracting to the primary mission of rocketboom and our teams talents
1395303 every moment we spent on ads was a moment lost on the content we wanted to interface with ads in some way but why not leave this job up to people who have a passion for it
1395304 risking everything to make this the best distribution and advertising deal ever
1395305 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there

1395331 amen meaning so be it is of hebrew origin the hebrew word amen derives from the hebrew verb aman a primitive root this triliteral root mn means to be firm confirmed reliable faithful have faith believe popular among some theosophists and adherents of esoteric christianity is the conjecture that amen is a derivative of the name of the egyptian god named amun which is sometimes also spelled amen there is no academic support for this view

1395335 your wife is a disappointment to her parents because she did not stand up for what is considered the faith of her father
1395336 their rules have no bearing on me why would parents be so cruel to their daughter for not following their strict religious rules their allah doesnt even exist anyway
1395337 god is always good even when it doesnt seem that way to us
1395338 science is just as factual as many religions i mean both evolution and islam are based on mans ideas and experiences are they not
1395339 you people have every right to make fun of those who believe in a creator but dont you think its kinda silly
1395340 why do you come so strongly against people believing in god

1395347 there is a lack of sensitivity here that could come off as a bit juvenile and petty
1395348 oh great way to scare him back into his christian burrow
1395349 it may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad but by people being fundamentally people
1395350 that is no way to have people listen to you to me this should be a place where christians and exchristians alike can come and talk faith an open forum where doubting christians can come without fear of mocking attacks or being made the villian
1395351 come on in tell your stories be honest here we know that you came from a place where you feared that if others knew the real you you would be hated oh and by the way you cant say anything that might offend someone so sorry
1395352 to me this should be a place where christians and exchristians alike can come and talk faith an open forum where doubting christians can come without fear of mocking attacks or being made the villian
1395353 it will only perpetuate the myth of the pious that without christianity we are just assholes waiting to happen with no tact or sensitivity toward others
1395354 to put it another way anybody stupid enough to believe a tale about a flying zombie god and his band of cannibals is beneath my respect
1395355 remain as respectul as possible with the content you can control
1395356 some content could easily keep a christian who is doubting his faith from taking a further look into what you have to offer
1395357 your constant references to god and jesus offend me could you please refrain from talking about them and all things spiritual in my presence
1395358 you are the way you are just because youre not good enough
1395359 mr x and mr y are homosexuals they are in sin and they will not repent no one from this congregation is to have anything to do with them and they will no longer be allowed on church grounds

1395362 kwartist99 said wayne thanks for that ill cut and paste it to remind me of the person i hope to never be regardless of a belief in a higher power way too lose it for no fuckin reason
1395363 paul mentions some of these evidences of true christians the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control galatians 5 2 23
1395364 if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not take him into your house or welcome him anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work
1395365 watch out for false prophets they come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves matthew 7 15
1395366 i suppose you dont have to respect me it is your choice but i am going to give my two cents on your reply

1395376 those who regularly post acidic angry rhetoric may be banned from posting
1395377 posters agree not to use this blog to post any material which is knowingly abusive vulgar hateful
1395378 personal hate campaigns and acidic angry rhetoric are okay as long as they are directed at christians im not against freedom of expression im not against
1395379 allowing ex christians to express their frustrations in a virtual atmosphere of anonymity gives those who are hurting the chance to clear the air vent meet others with similar experiences and in time analyze reassess and heal from the abuse
1395380 i dont get it how does bad mouthing christians encourage ex christians
1395381 how did that guy get away without your strangling him
1395382 when a christian starts inanely preaching about hell sin and the need to repent it can be like pushing a button or emotional trigger in the de convert such insensitivity on the part of the christian will likely be viewed as a personal attack and could very well be met with exasperation resentment or even aggressive resistance
1395383 try it just once more maybe youll like it this time
1395384 ive left the faith and my parents are concerned they shared this illustration with me whats the best way to respond
1395385 i dont get it how does bad mouthing christians encourage ex christians
1395386 how did that guy get away without your strangling him
1395387 try it just once more maybe youll like it this time
1395388 i do get a bit concerned when newbies try to tell exchristians how they should behave
1395389 then say that up front and quit advertising the site as a place of encouragement
1395390 would you laugh off someone calling your wife sister mother fill in the blank a child fucking pedophile
1395391 when al qaeda claimed responsibility for americas 9 11 tragedy well those were just words right
1395392 only until theyre aimed at you or someone thing you care for
1395393 when al qaeda claimed responsibility for americas 9 11 tragedy well those were just words right
1395394 but i thought we were talking about words isnt that what you said
1395395 sticks and stones can break my bones but names will never hurt me
1395396 im not telling people what to do im just asking questions
1395397 the idea is to concentrate on god and not his alleged flock
1395398 if thats what christians are i dont want to be one
1395399 you are responsible for the deaths and suffering of millions i hope youve got a good excuse
1395400 the idea is to concentrate on god and not his alleged flock
1395401 there is not one word in scripture to support nor validate this stupidity on the part of hagge amp his flock
1395402 yahweh jehovah of armies the god of fire and war makes this very clear and ordered or enacted more murder than hitler and stalin combined
1395403 the idea is to concentrate on god and not his alleged flock
1395404 you seem concerned that people leave the church because of what they see in other christians their behaviors their manifest attitudes their expressed stated beliefs
1395405 if thats what christians are i dont want to be one
1395406 christians are the only manifestation there is for their religion christians spend a great deal of time and energy explaining the false prophets the were still sinners too the he she is still forgiven rev pyle
1395407 yeah im sorry your mom died thirty years too soon and your dad was a womanizing manipulative liar and your best friend died in a head on collision god must have a plan for them
1395408 the idea is to concentrate on god and not his alleged flock
1395409 look at me god lives in me my actions are good join us
1395410 hes drawn a line between himself and his nuttier co religionists
1395411 as a nondenominational minister i am disturbed and enraged by the fact that many people who leave the church do so because of the dumb actions of certain believers the idea is to concentrate on god and not his alleged flock
1395412 my point is that many christians who arrive here do not obey the dictates of their own religion they post on this site with beams in their eyes howling at dave to remove the speck in his they claim a loving god and can neither give a convincing argument for the claim based upon the contents of their faith nor the example of their own behavior they call dave hateful and promise him nothing but hell
1395413 take this gift and then make yourself a mental and emotional slave to me for the rest of your life or ill roast your sorry ass in hell for eternity
1395414 god jesus the holy spirit and salvation are very very easy to understand little children can grasp the concept
1395415 what do i have to do to save my life and avoid suffering and death
1395416 love me say that you love me but believe in your heart that you do my gift to you will be life if you love me if you deny me the attention that i need then you will surely die i am very jealous and i need to to be all mine if not i will snap your neck and put a bullet in your head
1395417 i thank you for your time gloria in explaining to us how stupid we really are i must have over read the bible
1395418 a free gift work your ass off false sense of security and well being wasted hours panic attacks
1395419 this gift says take this gift and then make yourself a mental and emotional slave to me for the rest of your life or ill roast your sorry ass in hell for eternity
1395420 just replace the snapping of the neck and the gunshot with hellfire and brimstone and there ya have the gospel message in a nutshell
1395421 true christians dont write hateful e mail they do not condemn people to hell
1395422 god jesus the holy spirit and salvation are very very easy to understand little children can grasp the concept
1395423 so we do our job and we torture an kill him which finally makes him happy except for those folks that cant believe in the absolute insanity of the whole concept
1395424 my point is that many christians who arrive here do not obey the dictates of their own religion they post on this site with beams in their eyes howling at dave to remove the speck in his they claim a loving god and can neither give a convincing argument for the claim based upon the contents of their faith nor the example of their own behavior they call dave hateful and promise him nothing but hell
1395425 i look upon death to be as necessary to the constitution as sleep we shall rise refreshed in the morning
1395426 you dont have a god who gets things done you have a religion that explains why he doesnt
1395427 you mean that jar it seems kind of cramped to me
1395428 how do we handle it when someone we know and care about dies
1395429 welll friends i do hope you will take my advice and see if there are any hard facts in the areas of geology archaeology biochemistry etc to back up what the bible says
1395430 i found that there is an abundance of evidence for god and as one would expect from a reasonable god he has not left himself without testimony far from it
1395431 also lots of churches dont accept what the bible says and dont understand it
1395432 for instance if evolution is true then the bible is not simple
1395433 maybe the real god of the bible isnt to be messed with
1395434 welll friends i do hope you will take my advice and see if there are any hard facts in the areas of geology archaeology biochemistry etc to back up what the bible says
1395435 at least have a look to see then you will not after all be sincere will you
1395436 real god of the bible isnt to be messed with
1395437 well friends i do hope you will take my advice and see if there are any hard facts in the areas of geology archaeology biochemistry etc to back up what the bible says
1395438 yknow its a real drag getting up early on sunday morning i think ill reject the whole ball of wax and sleep in
1395439 breathing through the nostrils genesis says all the animals who had the breath of life in other words all that breathed i am quoting both times the king james
1395440 there is nor ever has been any such thing as a simple life form this is a simple untruth all life is and always has been complex
1395441 the fossil records show a sudden appearance of complex lifeforms with no preceeding type
1395442 lets consider what is being proposed that by random chance processes mutations over aeons of time complex life came from simple life ok is this rational
1395443 it is proposed that ultimately we are descended from a rock from goo being hit by lightening etc now some things we do know and are fundemental laws of nature we do not get order from chaos ever
1395444 all systems always degenerate or devolve they do not go to higher levels of complexity by themselves ever
1395445 the whole question of the bible authority rests upon the creation is it rational in the light of what we know about biochemistry for instance to suppose that life originated by accident of course not
1395446 prior to the flood it had never rained at all
1395447 anyone can google this stuff just type proof of noahs flood or problems with radio dating etc
1395448 it is he who sitteth on the circle of the earth
1395449 if it is true that the earth is spherical in shape then the bible is not true
1395450 the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth
1395451 after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
1395452 once again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory
1395453 i have noticed this technique a lot especially with reference to noahs ark and the flood for instance noah did not have to take every living thing but only those that breathed through their nostrils and only the kind not every variant and yet despite this scoffers produce huge lists of the millions of creatures ignoring what the bible says on the matter
1395454 anyway yes i feared god from what i learned and truly repented and gladly took the salvation offered but the start was realizing that first and foremost he was the creator with sovreignty over the earth and life did not come by accident
1395455 i have to bend my understanding to what it says
1395456 as far as i know all observed changes involve a loss of information never a gain which is precisely what is required for evolution to take place
1395457 evolutionary thinking contributes nothing to these areas in fact i would argue that it hinders progress and as you may know the founders of modern science such as
1395458 hey the sun rises in the east not the west
1395459 i stand by what i said about so called simple life forms this is a total cop out by people who presumably want to explain away the complexity of living organisms
1395460 the fossil record can be equally and in my view more satisfactorily explained by hydrological sorting weight and mobility in the light of a flood and of course it is catastrophic there is a general sorting yes certainly but its not uniform it is catastrophic and jumbled
1395461 point being i have to bend my understanding to what it says rather than the other way around
1395462 i would like to point out that noah preached and warned about the flood
1395463 to cover the entire planet to the summit of chomolungma a k a mount everest 29028 feet above sea level in the alleged forty days it would have to rain at a rate of 30 2375 feet of rain per hour im sure she is right if that were the case but the water from the flood did not come from the rain only some of it genesis says the fountains of the deep were broken open this suggests some form of water storage underneath the upper crust of the earth
1395464 all systems always degenerate or devolve they do not go to higher levels of complexity by themselves ever
1395465 the whole question of the bible authority rests upon the creation is it rational in the light of what we know about biochemistry for instance to suppose that life originated by accident

1395486 he has laboured mightily that we can have an escape from judgement
1395487 i now believe that to teach a theory as fact is lieing
1395488 gentrys opponents will always fight his evidence because his conclusions are entirely unacceptable to them although they cannot disprove him
1395489 creationists have disputed these conclusions often citing analysis posted on the answers in genesis website that says that this phenomenon was evidence that
1395490 i now believe that to teach a theory as fact is lieing also that the naturalistic philosophies of evolution are harmfull as i can see reading on this site
1395491 jim arvo what price yer uniform fossil record now shouldnt the clams be somewhere else like the bottom of the fossil record instead of the top
1395492 fossils are jumbled up dead seacreatures with dead land creatures why so they inhabhit different environments there is no way they should be found together
1395493 the uniform fossil record is an evolutionist fantasy it does not exist in the real world
1395494 dr john morris is an oil company geologist said certain spatial patterns have been noted but they fit just as well if not better into a catastrophic flood framework as they do into a uniformitarian evolutionary concept
1395495 dave8 jimarvo i think it is self evident that all and any life form is extremely complex from a single leaf or cell to a complete creature in my view there are in consequence no simple life forms

1395497 developmental psychology also known as human development is the scientific study of progressive psychological changes that occur in human beings as they age originally concerned with infants and children the field has expanded to include adolescence and more recently adult development aging and the entire life span this field examines change across a broad range of topics including motor skills and other psycho physiological processes problem solving abilities conceptual understanding language acquisition moral understanding and identity formation developmental psychologists investigate key questions such as whether children are qualitatively different from adults or simply lack the experience that adults draw upon two important issues concern the nature of development one concerns whether development occurs through the gradual accumulation of knowledge or through shifts from one stage of thinking to another the other concerns whether children are born with innate knowledge or figure things out through experience a third significant area of research examines social contexts that affect development

1395507 this is the opposite of what would be produced from random chance processes over aeons of time any computer scientist will tell you that or a creationist jerk
1395508 how do we get those wavy rock formations and layers curving around and the polytrate fossils like tree trunks going through layers that are supposed to be seperated by vast periods of time
1395509 even the profesional evolutionists have given up trying to prove it on the fossil evidence and are now trying to do it at the cellular level but thats going to be even worse for them
1395510 god says there are no races and we are all of one blood from adam
1395511 there is no state religion in australia the establishment of which is prohibited by the constitution nearly two thirds 64 of the population claim at least nominal adherence to a christian based religion but nearly one third 30 do not identify with any religion 1 the remaining population is a diverse group that includes fast growing islamic and buddhist communities
1395512 in the uk almost everybody believes in the bible literally and those that dont learn to keep their mouths shut by gosh
1395513 with over 170 distinct religions counted in the 2001 census the religious make up of the uk is diverse complex multicultural and surprising less than half of the british people believe in a god yet about 72 told the 2001 census that they were christian and 66 of the population have no actual connection to any religion or church despite what they tend to write down on official forms between 1979 and 2005 half of all christians stopped going to church on a sunday religion in britain has suffered an immense decline since the 1950s and all indicators show a continued secularisation of british society in line with other european countries such as france
1395514 but they wont give up so we keep their dangerous ideas out of science journals etc lucky for them we live in such a tolerant society but i guess we will have to lock em up one day as they are such a menace to logic and reason and our way of life
1395515 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well
1395516 creationist claptrap to logically infer from complexity and coding that there must be a designer
1395517 that language requires an agreement between sender and receiver yes how deluded of me
1395518 i just cant imagine how there can be x without a god to design it
1395519 ok since you are puter man tell me how banging away on a keyboard is gonna produce a functioning program
1395520 in the uk almost everybody believes in the bible literally and those that dont learn to keep their mouths shut by gosh
1395521 natural variation is true of course we can observe that but to say that this produces an entirely new kind of animal no theres no proof of this esp in the fossil record as there are no transitionals and there should be many

1395523 my assertion that life is complex is based upon what even a layman can learn about information dna and cell reproduction which is found in all living things

1395525 if complexity causes life forms today then complexity always causes life forms
1395526 beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them otherwise you have no reward with your father who is in heaven
1395527 so waht if miy speling and comas are shot check some of the other contributions on this post filthy language arrogance not to mention your own contribution now i think about it how hypocritical is that
1395528 and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
1395529 point being i have to bend my understanding to what it says rather than the other way around
1395530 not really dave i suppose that complex life and the infromation in it indicates order and a designer rather than complexity being an end in itself it is indicative
1395531 if a causes b today then a always causes b
1395532 if complexity causes life forms today the complexity always causes life forms
1395533 if a designer causes complex life forms then a designer always causes complex life forms
1395534 i can test the assertion that water is hot by pitting my finger in it if i am not sure the first time i can do it again yep its hot if i didnt trust my own judgement i can ask a friend
1395535 you are right god does not love you you are his enemy
1395536 have i started with beliefs and then searched for evidence
1395537 he believes that animals evolved but humans did not they were created
1395538 that is if your assumtion is that there was only one single cell of one type
1395539 which could explain a kind of mutation by converging with each other too
1395540 regardless i dont know is not a bold answer it is just plain honest even if i studied the science of evolution in depth
1395541 boy that was one delicious leopard i wonder if there are any more around here
1395542 that was close that old jack russell nearly had me
1395543 here monkey hop on my back and see whats going to happen to that conniving canine
1395544 wheres that damn monkey i sent him off an hour ago to bring me another leopard s amp s but the theory has been held tenaciously and i suspect that is because of the
1395545 secondly you are employing the very argument that some of us admonished you to not use and that for your review is that attempting to shoot holes in the current leading scientifically based hypothesis for the origins of life
1395546 jesus was the jewish messiah that fulfilled the old testament prophesies
1395547 this imo is a poor analogy if it is meant to illustrate a parallel to believing in
1395548 the search for peace and the search for truth are often times two entirely different things in other words the two might not necessarily yield the same results
1395549 are you telling me that having the blood of your former and now deceased
1395550 to me it has to do with why the invisible and the non existent look so much alike
1395551 just didnt really believe and i was confirmed in that when prayers didnt get answered
1395552 duuude you dont hafta prove to those clowns that you exist dude like yur god dude
1395553 how you would know with absolute certainty that this alleged bearded and youthful being that you heard didnt hear is the christian deity and not thor or allah or ebenezer scrooges ghost
1395554 close encounters reported over the years there should be ample evidence of extraterrestrials and since i have not seen any myself nor heard of any credible evidence its too inconclusive to make a final call on it
1395555 im not looking for evidence ive found what im looking for why would i continue to look for evidence besides god reaches me in a way that is far superior to physical evidence
1395556 who would want to seek fools gold when a treasure has already been found
1395557 just because there is no physical evidence that evolution is true doesnt mean its not true
1395558 just because there is no evidence that the old pagan gods ever existed that doesnt mean they dont exist
1395559 close encounters reported over the years there should be ample evidence of extraterrestrials and since i have not seen any myself nor heard of any credible evidence its too inconclusive to make a final call on it
1395560 foi interessante para mim e duro para todos encontrar um caminho para essa conven o do filme de n o ter nomes foi dif cil n s nos demos conta de qu o forte a identifica o que temos com os nossos pr prios nomes
1395561 they have faith in god to get them through their grief
1395562 well maybe god spared him his suffering and caused him to die
1395563 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
1395564 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
1395565 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
1395566 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
1395567 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
1395568 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
1395569 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
1395570 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
1395571 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
1395572 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
1395573 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
1395574 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
1395575 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
1395576 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
1395577 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
1395578 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
1395579 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
1395580 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
1395581 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
1395582 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
1395583 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
1395584 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
1395585 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
1395586 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1395588 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1395589 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades
1395590 it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1395591 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1395592 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1395593 army offering six figure bonuses for arabic speakers after kicking out dozens under dadt
1395594 well can i go and kill people today because they are not following the will of god
1395595 no you cant go out and kill people because they arent following gods will
1395596 christian nation that shit comes out of the xristians overheated imagination the xristian mind is a fetid breeding ground for fantasy
1395597 i simply have come to the conclusion that i cannot buy into the club
1395598 im currently trying to find out what is the truth in this world
1395599 well can i go and kill people today because they are not following the will of god
1395600 im afraid to leave because what if im wrong and go to hell
1395601 and to eris discordia i dont know if you read or understood much of what i said wish thinker wishful thinking do you not understand that is that whats important to you how in the world did you come to the conclusion that im not for reading or for seaching or for progress because im not for questioning all the parts of christianity if youre still searching for what you want in christianity then youre the one whos quit searching for anything real i love new ideas i just dont like old wrong ones and please tell me what else is it that ive been faking
1395602 admitting their possibility makes me no less of an atheist if it does in your eyes suprenova amp aubreydawn then you dont know what atheism is go elsewhere if you cant appreciate the scientific method
1395603 i would think it better for those who have their beliefs to follow them and if they wish to share make information available to those that want it not force it on everyone and drive them to places like this out of spite
1395604 i consider biblegod to be so extremely unlikely that im 99 999 sure that it does not exist
1395605 and those that do not believe in god because they do not feel god in their lives as christians a fundamentally flawed reason to not believe in god
1395606 the fact that it gets to you that you dont see miracles happen in your life means that you want god to make them happen and that shows that you do believe in him
1395607 what if there isnt any god out there listening to me
1395608 atheism is supposedly the lack of belief not in just god but in anything other than science
1395609 science cannot explain all things it cannot explain love it can explain the process of love but it cannot explain the emotional connection you feel with someone
1395610 i mean fundamentally why is it that when two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom form a covalent bond that the substance we know as water is produced why is it not something different
1395611 why does it have to have the properties it does
1395612 the theory of evolution basically says that a random mutation occurs and if the mutation is a favorable trait the mutated branch of a species lives and those with unfavorable traits die
1395613 really though isnt the fact that you have to believe that spontaneously for absolutely no given reason
1395614 who is to say that the mutation of a gene is not the work of god
1395615 the more we delve into science the more mysteries we find
1395616 im not saying i dislike atheists or think badly of a person simply because they are but i think atheism is sad people who are so driven to not believe in god and to create an anti religion which ends up becoming yet another religion yes i believe atheism is a religion fundamentally atheism is the disbelief in god inversely atheism is a belief a belief that god does not exist saying that you are a group of people who do not believe in god who try to get others to not believe in god
1395617 we dont know whose fault it was there will be a full investigation by the air accidents investigation branch
1395618 our flight lh4853 was parked with the brake on when another aircraft came by and just touched the tip of the wing

1395620 we are hoping to be able to fly them all on to germany today if possible
1395621 god doesnt give it to me to put in the bank he entrusts me to do with it what he would want me to do
1395622 you know im always careful and i know what im doing
1395623 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1395624 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1395627 ok its not what i thought but i can be happy with the transcending bueaty of nature the world and the universe
1395628 what i thought was god was only a human concept to explain the unexplainable such as overwhelming emotions and nothing more
1395629 you dont want to be an atheist it is far too lonely and nobody understands why you are doing it anyways trust me on that one i converted to atheism 2 years ago and all it did was help me to lose friends and make people think i was a weirdo
1395630 if it wasnt for agnosticism i wouldnt know what to believe
1395631 we dont need you we have the book and so quit bugging us
1395632 the reason i said i am still a christian is because i still believe in the god of the bible
1395633 why are all of the churchs answers rhetorical and mystical when confronted with critical questions
1395634 i refuse to believe in a god who i cannot experience or understand i will not be a deist
1395635 atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud atheism is an attitude a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively fearlessly always trying to understand all things as a part of nature
1395636 gods genocide of the amelkite infants is just demonstrating his love for us
1395637 jacinta declares that our ladys dress goes down only to her knees our lady can only appear dressed obviously in the most decent and modest way the dress would have to come down to her feet any other way constitutes the most serious obstacle to the supernaturalism of the apparition and makes us think that it is a mystification prepared by the spirit of darkness
1395638 obviously a virgin mary dressed in such a scandalous way could not have been the mother of god but possibly a vision sent by satan himself the image of the virgin had to be cleaned up to go along with orthodoxy
1395639 today few people know about this detail just as few know how l cia was practically kidnapped at the age of 14 by the church hierarchy and held incommunicado in convents for the rest of her life or that francisco and jacinta tortured themselves in the name of religion before they finally died
1395640 god still testifies today as he did 2000 years ago by using the supernatural
1395641 i think he reveals himself as he does to keep everyones free will open to reject him
1395642 since 1986 jesus has been in communication with a person named vassula ryden
1395643 i hope that 2 peter 2 20 22 never happens to you
1395644 said can someone then explain to me why she mary then failed to
1395645 you really think that mere children would pass on water and food just because of their imaginations
1395646 many of you will one day repent and return to your father
1395647 since 1986 jesus has been in communication with a person named vassula ryden
1395648 although she claims to be married to jesus she refers to him as father and he supposedly calls her daughter
1395649 the claimed private revelation to vassula ryden is very clearly and thoroughly shown by the above examples to be false
1395650 maybe animals will live eternally and god could combine a hell for human beings with a heaven for mosquitoes
1395651 a diverse range of topics from the paranormal and the ufo phenomenon to cryptozoology and ancient mysteries
1395652 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
1395653 science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one
1395654 death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
1395655 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved
1395656 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1395657 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor
1395658 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1395659 do i not fill heaven and earth saith the lord
1395660 you can still measure heat and light you still cant measure god or the lack thereof
1395661 would some of you comment on this so i can give them some logical answers to whatever this is trying to say
1395662 mr x and mr y are in sin and they will not repent they are homosexuals and they will not repent no one from this youth group is to have any contact with them whatsoever they will not be allowed to enter the church grounds anymore
1395663 apparently the ones running the site dont think that mindless name calling is appropriate
1395664 after all who chooses what they think is the second or third best way to behave we all do what we do because we think thats the best
1395665 my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1395666 you know folks if we accept that st nick gives us the choice to be good or naughty
1395667 i suppose im surprised at how many people never learned this but i guess high school level physics isnt necessarily common knowledge
1395668 have fun christians and other believers with your gods and credit everything good to them i on the other hand will keep looking for the good in people and give them credit for their heroic deeds and their unselfish actions for kindness altruism and a helping hand
1395669 the natural material of which things are comprised erets exists hayah formless tohu as an empty void bohu obscured in darkness chosek along with the presence of the inaccessible and mysterious depths

1395671 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties and needs no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
1395672 spend eternity in the lightless abyss the place where god is not
1395673 the more you give to god the more he will give to you

1395769 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1395770 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1395771 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1395772 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1395773 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1395774 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies

1395839 the concept of networking sites provides an opportunity for individuals to communicate quickly and efficiently via a convenient online platform
1395840 as the concept matured business professionals realized that such a forum could be used beyond keeping in touch if applied to business as an indispensable tool that can actually help to produce measurable results
1395841 the trend is part and parcel of what the internet can provide namely an alternate more broad based interface with like minded individuals
1395842 when you couple that with the failure of traditional support systems for small business the burgeoning of our community is not surprising
1395843 anyone striving to narrowcast to a high caliber group of decision makers in the business community can effectively reach their target audiences by way of this very captive space

1395849 says iran is renowned for using diplomacy as a stall tactic
1395850 i dont think that anybody really does believe that theres a diplomatic solution the iranians are well known for attrition and wearing down their opponents with never ending negotiations that can go on and on this is their strategy and has been their strategy forever
1395851 iran is a country which is openly committed to destroying israel is committed to performing another holocaust i think that whats happened in israel the third generation after the holocaust has sort of gone back to a holocaust mentality sense that yes this could happen again the statements coming from iran have exacerbated that feeling

1395867 the pressurized nitrogen is there to push the hydrogen peroxide out of the other two tanks the hydrogen peroxide runs through a pipe and hits a silver mesh catalyst when it hits the silver the hydrogen peroxide immediately turns into oxygen and water the water flashes into high pressure steam because of the heat of the reaction the steam is then directed out two nozzles to create thrust
1395868 how do you get more range from the same amount of fuel you have to use some kind of engine to move a whole lot of air rather than using direct rocket like thrust there are two ways to move a lot of air propellers and jet engines
1395869 would you play for more money overseas or less in the nba

1395877 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1395878 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1395879 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1395880 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1395881 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1395882 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1395883 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1395884 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1395885 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1395886 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1395887 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1395888 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1395889 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1395890 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1395891 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1395892 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1395893 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1395894 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1395895 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1395896 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1395897 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1395898 maliki iraqi president and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia
1395899 while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1395901 youd go up to hit and they were in your eyes and ears and mouth
1395902 the chances of any normal human being taking the time to add incredibly valuable meta data to the great wads of digital data they create daily approximates zero
1395903 most people would prefer root canal work than the utter tedium and ambient feeling of futility that accompanies meta data creation besides everyone is too busy oh and besides that again it always seems to be more fun to create new stuff than to create stuff about old stuff
1395904 any gadget technique or service that adds even vaguely useful meta data without requiring significant human intervention will find a very receptive market out there

1396034 the anc has arrogantly claimed that the duty of parliament is to simply implement the policy of the ruling party even if it runs counter to the will of the people
1396035 they have no mandate to implement such a controversial policy of national importance without first holding a national referendum on the issue
1396036 i accept the correctness of the reports and i am bound by the observations but im not bound by the deductions made by the state pathologist
1396037 the line about killing civilians i believe is an unfortunate one we sometimes hear it in europe we should not fall prey to that argument that somehow were killing innocent civilians it is the taliban that is doing that

1396047 there were similar cases before world war ii and thats what i used as an example
1396048 in the past germany invited tragedy by letting the nazis take power

1396051 obama cant repudiate the artists in the hip hop industry for fear of alienating a large part of the african american demographic
1396052 if ludacris cared about obamas campaign he would shut up i printed out the lyrics and used them to line the birdcage
1396053 ludacris is ludicrous who cares what that cretin has to say
1396054 bill you are always defending obama subtle begging is ludicrous doesnt speak well for you and wont get you the interview youre dying to get with him
1396055 ludacris very well may have accomplished one of the main things mccain needs most to get elected mobilize the lukewarm conservative white vote
1396056 i think ludacris gave obama the chance to make a good impression by answering immediately with that statement obama has demonstrated he wont tolerate this stuff even from a supporter
1396057 your report took the lyrics completely out of context if you listen to the song in its entirety it is clear that ludacris is encouraging black americans to get out the vote

1396066 your attack on exxon mobil is outrageous it makes less than 10 profit on its sales substantially lower than many industries their volume of business is so huge you assume something sinister is afoot
1396067 wise up the government is more culpable for high oil prices than exxon mobil their second quarter missed expectations and a lot of regular folks got hurt when its stock prices took a dip today
1396068 cleary 12 4 billion is just too much money to make in one quarter congress should outlaw it
1396069 oil companies such as exxon mobil should be applauded for turning any profit at all in this type of environment they are taxed so heavily their contribution to u s coffers is enormous

1396263 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently

1396285 i have a commitment to the architectural heritage of this city but theres not one environmental planning lawyer that believes the present plans can sustain a court challenge
1396286 the council was being advised by experts at the time of the original decision on plan change 163 its difficult for me to see while theres been no real change to the houses how the council could have shifted in its position so markedly
1396287 what thats saying is well give a little bit back and that might make you feel better
1396288 what were saying is we want the whole of residential 2 protected
1396289 we dont want it watered down we want the council to stand up to what was agreed to two years ago
1396290 i think the controls should stay and people who dont want them can apply to have them removed
1396291 we want to acknowledge the family are cooperating with us
1396292 the parents are at their sons bedside and we are working with them
1396293 the injuries suffered by this baby boy are a tragedy and our condolences and sympathies go out to his family and loved ones
1396294 we as a club have an asset so its that delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the players and the demands of the football club
1396295 you are never comfortable with your resources as a manager
1396296 we as a club have an asset so its that delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the players and the demands of the football club
1396297 weve got to remember that brett emerton and steven reid reidy can play down there i think david dunn dunny has also played there in the past
1396298 its an advantage to anybody whos played a tournament of that intensity
1396299 theyre not forced to play it right from the tips but they probably will do
1396300 i think theyll probably set it up equally as tough
1396301 i dont want anyone touching me im tired of everybody touching me
1396302 your friend is the man who knows all about you and still likes you
1396303 the only way to have a friend is to be one
1396304 no i cant there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat there is no place here for you
1396305 i cant help you love you are all wet and might damage my boat
1396306 oh love i am so sad that i need to be by myself
1396307 because only time is capable of understanding how valuable love is
1396308 after i hurt you you wrote in the sand and now you write on a stone why
1396309 when someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away but when someone does something good for us we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it
1396310 now i have 4 wives with me but when i die ill be alone how lonely ill be
1396311 i loved you most endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you now that im dying will you follow me and keep me company

1396315 at the very most i can only send you to your grave
1396316 bray says the problem with hfcs is not only that it is sweeter than other forms of sugar but also that it does not affect appetite fructose adds to overeating because it does not trigger chemical messengers that tell the brain the stomach is full and no longer hungry like food and drinks that contain regular refined sugar do
1396317 our members chose the albums that have consistently excited record buyers over the years and those that have the potential for continued success based on enduring popularity some of them are recognizable landmark albums while others are very new by contemporary artists we have pop country r amp b rock rap punk jazz soul reggae and more hopefully the inevitable debate about the 200 must own albums will underscore just how much the music and the art form mean to everyone
1396318 we have one more new song to play and then well go on the downward slope into the past
1396319 roger and i have been through here doing other things visiting holes in the ground and maybe seeing a couple of blondes
1396320 first came here in 67 it was a one horse town literally i was taken riding in the desert with a native american and it only took 15 minutes to get to the desert now it will take about three hours
1396321 we have short term goals and long term goals our short short term goal is to do everything we can to make sure the process is respected for hillary at the convention
1396322 we are phoning and emailing and lobbying to make sure there is an open roll call and vote and her name is placed in nomination
1396323 never in the entire history have any two candidates come to what amounts to a tie in the primaries yet senator clinton has been ask over and over to drop out of the race surely others have taken their case to the convention and with far less pledged delegates as senator clinton
1396324 i know my polish language is very difficult to learn so i wanted to try another difficult one
1396325 i just want to be able to say hello or say the food is very good i know in polish thats not easy to learn
1396326 the air is not so bad it could be worse
1396327 this is my first olympics and i didnt know what to expect but its better than i thought
1396328 we all had some breathing problems when we arrived but its gotten better day to day
1396329 i can say the food tastes good and the quality i think its ok for sportsmen
1396330 we did have someone come in for psychological treatment but that was a chinese who was apparently under too much stress on an olympic job
1396331 my deal was i felt like you left it to me a little bit
1396332 and then what got me was jimmie johnson theyd committed to coming so i was like well well go ahead and come but if bob would have said stay out thats what we would have done but i think we were both about 51 percent on the come in side and neither one of us were going to argue but the argument came when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming he said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea so thats where the argument came
1396333 we can be brutally honest with one another and thats really valuable
1396334 theres no beating around the bush if bob feels a certain way about something he tells me and i tell him and to me thats really valuable
1396335 carl and i i dont know what the perception is but we argue on a regular basis
1396336 yes sometimes it doesnt and when it doesnt we say ok we argued through it
1396337 ill look at carl and ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1396338 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1396339 matt kenseth and robbie reiser did a great job and matts doing a great job with chip bolin right now they and carl and bob are in the same place with the best of the best and unless youve got that maturity of wisdom and presence and experience gives you that within the organization and having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it because when things go bad youre going to disintegrate and carls going to be ready to do that this year and im real confident
1396340 i dont believe in momentum so much but i tell you what the confidence could lead to some momentum
1396341 seeing how happy my guys were to me thats the most important part because 10 points at the end of the day is great thats wonderful but i think the championship is probably going to be settled by more than that and i feel like my guys having that little step in their walk is good
1396342 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1396343 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1396344 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1396345 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1396346 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
1396347 zitto zitto non lo dire hush hush dont you say that
1396348 oh please you shut up do you want the car to break down do you want anything bad to happen to us
1396349 as i well knew the gods are envious creatures and it is
1396350 beware polycrates such fortune being not allowed to humans get rid of whatever is most precious and dear to you in order to escape from gods wrath
1396351 is something who is so envious worth being cared for
1396352 why would the god s not want men to be happy
1396353 i would really be interested to hear the greek thing
1396354 modesty and virtue are now powerless lawlessness rules and men do not strive any more against gods envy

1396359 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1396360 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1396361 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1396362 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1396363 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1396364 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1396365 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1396366 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight

1396387 its wrong of the islamic council to wait for the
1396388 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law the council wasnt able to deal with the question of homosexuality this time but it thinks that subject is quite relevant and wants to look at the matter more
1396389 its very important to have the european fatwa council with us in difficult matters like this i am not in favour of the death penalty but there are islamic texts that various people understand differently this is why we need to know the attitude of the authority before we make a decision
1396390 and big shaker why is it surprising that they should look to a fatwa council

1396475 bulgaria have always had a technically strong underage set up and coupled with two away fixtures it is invaluable experience for the team to adapt to the climate and facilities which they may not be accustomed to

1396493 china lost its status as the worlds cheapest country for manufacturing some time ago

1396495 searching for countries with lower wages or returning production to germany
1396496 the companies that are most likely to return to germany are those that outsourced production out of cost considerations including the consumer goods industry and textiles which both produce in mass quantities
1396497 manufacturers of high quality goods are also looking at china with a more critical eye
1396498 a dip in quality for these companies could damage their reputation

1396500 innumerable times a while christian community has broken down because it had sprung from a wish dream the serious christian set down for the first time in a christian community is likely to bring with him a very definite idea of what life together should be and try to realize it but gods grace speedily shatters such dreams just as surely as god desires to lead us to a knowledge of genuine christian fellowship so surely must we be overwhelmed by a great disillusionment with others with christians in general and if we are fortunate with ourselves by sheer grace god will not permit us to live even for a brief period in a dream world
1396501 every human wish dream that is injected into the christian community is a hindrance to genuine community and must be banished if genuine community is to survive
1396502 god hates visionary dreaming it makes the dreamer proud and pretentious the man who fashions a visionary ideal of community demands that it be realized by god by others and by himself he enters the community of christians with demands sets up his own law and judges the brethren and god himself accordingly he stands adamant a living reproach to all others in the circle of brethren he acts as if he is the creator of the christian community as if his dream binds men together when things do not go his way he calls the effort a failure when his ideal picture is destroyed he sees the community going to smash so he becomes first an accuser of the brethren then an accuser of god and finally the despairing accuser of himself

1396516 i for one am staying in kadima this is my home
1396517 there is no justification for allowing the 70 000 plus people who joined the party to not know if the candidates will be here after the primary is over
1396518 various sources in kadima ranging from knesset members to activists accuse each other of making shady deals dubious promises to voters and particularly conduct that is reminiscent of the grim days of the likud central committee
1396519 generous pledges to appoint people to various public service posts and deals with various union members
1396520 we know whos trying to taint our campaign and why we wont be dragged there
1396521 unfortunately the municipalitys promises to lower student housing prices have not been fulfilled
1396522 they continue to approve ghost buildings for foreign residents and unfortunately thoughts are only of money not of the students welfare
1396523 lebanese officials from the president down had always legitimized hizbullahs resistance as a national cause
1396524 this time a vehemently anti hizbullah government led by a majority that has significant western support has put its signature to a clause that allows hizbullah to take action in the fields listed without seeking government approval
1396525 it also puts an end to any dreams of disarming hizbullah it secures hizbullahs armed existence
1396526 the fight against israel should take place in lebanon and not anywhere else
1396527 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1396528 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1396529 prostate specific antigen screening is associated with psychological harms and its potential benefits remain uncertain
1396530 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1396531 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1396532 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1396533 what matters is what people feel and what people feel right now is verging on panic
1396534 people want to budget economize and save money but they want a reason to believe in their economic futures too

1396537 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1396538 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1396539 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1396540 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1396541 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1396542 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1396543 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1396544 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1396545 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1396546 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1396547 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1396548 the new facility will also support the use of camp butner as an alternate command post in the event the current facilities are rendered untenable by a disaster or terrorist attack
1396549 we rely on the north carolina national guard to protect and defend us around the world
1396550 and we turn to them for help during disasters here at home giving them the resources for training they need to do their job is the least we can do for them
1396551 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied sheba farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend the country using all legal and possible means
1396552 when mashiach comes well ask him what religion he is
1396553 thus we established the significant reality of 250 000 jews living a normal jewish life of faith and joy in yesha the ancestral and biblical heartland today more than all the distorted plans and roadmaps drawn up by foreigners we are sure that this reality will determine the future life of israel and its redemption process
1396554 get thee out of your country unto a land that i will show you
1396555 for all the land which you see i will give you and to your children forever
1396556 it is interesting to note that in this same period the israelite migration including the exodus from egypt and conquest of canaan was an era of migrations and conquests in the eastern mediterranean region
1396557 four principal migrations and conquests included the israelites overwhelming the canaanites the dorians overwhelming mycenaean civilization in greece the achaeans sardinians and lycoans overwhelming the mediterranean islands and the philistines overwhelming the coastal region of canaan
1396558 they are permanent and inalienable even unto the end of days
1396559 sihon king of the amorites who lived at heshbon and ruled from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and from the middle of the valley as far as the river jabbok the boundary of the ammonites that is half of gilead
1396560 the arava to the sea of kinneret sea of galilee eastward and in the direction of beth jessimoth to the sea of the arava the salt sea dead sea southward to the foot of the slopes of pisgah
1396561 og king of bashan one of the remnant of the rephaim who lived at ashtaroth and at edrei and ruled over mount hermon and salecah and all bashan the golan heights to the boundary of the geshurites and the maacathites and over half of gilead to the boundary of sihon king of heshbon
1396562 moses the servant of the lord and the people of israel defeated them and moses the servant of the l rd gave their land for a possession to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
1396563 and these are the kings whom joshua and the people of israel defeated on the west side of the jordan from baal gad in the valley of lebanon to mount halak that rises toward seir
1396564 and joshua gave their land to the tribes of israel as a possession according to their allotments in the hill country in the lowland in the arava in the slopes in the wilderness and in the negev the land of the hittites the amorites the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
1396565 these are the other kings defeated by joshua and whose lands were liberated including jericho ai which is beside bethel jerusalem hebron jarmuth lachish eglon gezer debir geder hormah arad libnah adullam makkadesh
1396566 bethel tappuach hepher aphek lasharon madon hazor shimron meron of achshaph taanach megiddo kedesh yokneam in carmel dor in naphath dor goim in galilee tirzah in all the territories of thirty one kings
1396567 i would willingly give away judea and samaria he called it the west bank and the eastern half of jerusalem
1396568 i will do my best to achieve peace with our neighbors our first priority should be the palestinians but there are some obstacles
1396569 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem to the worst of our enemies
1396570 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
1396571 if a land has a soul then jerusalem is the soul of the land of israel
1396572 biometric information on a certain individual that reaches a criminal could be used by the criminal for as long as he wishes
1396573 we are witnessing great achievements on the part of islamic resistance groups in lebanon and the strengthening of hamas in palestine while witnessing the weakening of our enemies more than ever before
1396574 we wont make a big fuss over the delayed response to our nuke offer what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the coming days
1396575 deeply embarrassing for those who claim there is no extremism in british universities
1396576 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
1396577 they believe the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
1396578 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1396579 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1396585 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1396586 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1396587 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1396588 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1396589 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1396590 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives

1396611 i really enjoy working with students and i think its important that teachers have experience in performance its a good chance to give back
1396612 im extremely proud of my achievements with forest forge but in any of these kind of jobs after a while you tend to get itchy feet the institute has an excellent reputation within the industry and the job sounded exciting and interesting
1396613 this decision has not been taken without a great deal of thought but it has become increasingly difficult to fill the home as more and more people seeking out support wish to go into residential care closer to where they live or near family and friends
1396614 and as people are now staying in their own homes longer they move into residential care when they need specialist nursing or dementia care facilities which ivor newton house cannot offer
1396615 we fully understand the mbfs position re the inevitable closure of ivor newton house our concern is for the current residents who do not want to be evicted against their will albeit to suitable accommodation it is important to express the concerns of a group of people in their eighties and nineties who have no other collective voice
1396616 they were frustrated things had not gone smoothly and they were keen to get going
1396617 they were very excited about the trip they werefrustrated and suffering anxiety because things were not going right
1396618 i suggested batten might have a little local cruise and sail with his mates i said if youre not ready dont go
1396619 in recent years the fringe has been behaving like it is in charge of us all and it is not it is the central linking body that brings us all together it is an association of interests not one where the parent is talking to the child they have been getting very dominant in recent years and that has very much come out of the egos of the directors that have run it
1396620 there are always problems at the fringe and this is the biggest one the fringe has had to face it was a really significant issue for all the arguments of the edinburgh comedy festival divorcing from the fringe i think the one good thing that has come out of this whole crisis is it has brought us back together again
1396621 the fringe developed their system separate to the system that we had all been developing essentially the two were going their separate ways and in some ways the fringe and the comedy festival were going their separate ways because of the box office systems
1396622 i arrived six weeks before the festival to find that we were running a system that wasnt supported technically because we hadnt made the decision about what system to get my first job as soon as the festival had finished was to start a process of deciding there was no choice but to make a change and to make it in one year

1396661 dont lose the character of christ when you are trying to do the work of christ
1396662 its amazing what we can do for god when we arent worried about who gets the credit
1396663 the world in which we live is based on the premise that we can take charge of our lives but that is not so
1396664 there will come a time in our lives when we will have no choice but to wait on god
1396665 but we do have a choice in how we wait

1396736 even though we had the extra man sometimes it works for you and sometimes it doesnt
1396737 i have to give credit to tourlestrane they put it right up to us at the end and their policy of carrying the ball nearly worked
1396738 you can never relax against a tourlestrane team there is always fight in them even with 14 men
1396739 games between eastern harps and tourlestrane are some of the best played in sligo there is great rivalry and competition between the clubs
1396740 weve trained something like 40 to 45 times in the last three and a half months and a tremendous effort was put in by all the players and they deserved what they got today sunday im delighted for them
1396741 we built up slowly in april and tried to reinstall confidence in the players through challenge games and a few victories and it mushroomed from there i suppose
1396742 we have a young team overall with the average age of the team around 23 we knew that croke park is such a fine big pitch that if we spread the ball quickly we would have a real good chance of beating louth

1396749 hes been holding back i didnt realize how good an athlete he was until i started working with him he has the one thing that you have to have to play well whether you are a manning or thaddeus lewis hes tough
1396750 its going to be a lot more exciting for fans to watch and hopefully a lot more exciting for us by putting more points on the board
1396751 im thinking about going for it on fourth down and going for two point conversions
1396752 the focus that we have right now is on earning the right to win

1396761 the hungarian weekend was quite disappointing for me the only positive thing is the result
1396762 i dont want to deny that the last races didnt go as i wanted
1396763 at the hungaroring i was stuck behind alonso who had a really good car for the last sector which was maybe the only point i could have tried to overtake again i had confirmed that its impossible to overtake at budapest
1396764 after the last pit stop i could push hard because i had a free track
1396765 felipe had a great race and demonstrated the potential we have
1396766 congratulations to heikki kovalainen for his first win in formula 1 he had his share of bad luck and now its his turn

1396780 when i was pregnant with my daughter frankie i had all kinds of questions including ones about immunization there is a wealth of misinformation about vaccines out there particularly in hollywood
1396781 my husband and i took the time to speak to several doctors about our concerns what became clear to us was that delaying vaccines could jeopardize our babys life i have teamed up with every child by two to help parents get the facts straight on this very important issue
1396782 my main message to parents is that they should not be taking medical advice from me or any other celebrity they should look to their pediatrician the aap and other experts
1396783 it requires a mandate in order to get people to do whats in their best interests sometimes its called change

1396787 pleased to have liv vodka join our list of corporate sponsors
1396788 its the worst vodka ive ever had and purchased for a more than premium price i might add i certainly hope the makers of this vodka dont expect to win any awards or theyll be sorely disappointed this vodka reeks of potatoes and impurities both in smell and in taste currently its wasting space in my freezer until i build up the strength to throw it away and the 35 i spent for it

1396794 online and virtual classroom learning may be cost effective methods for enhancing and expanding the educational system
1396795 the limited number of teachers and the excellent online and virtual classroom programs now available demand that new methods and tools for teaching be utilized
1396796 our teachers are good in providing online resources for students
1396797 a lot of teachers are not prepared to teach online
1396798 whether the online experience is comparable to the face to face environment
1396799 students could end up being surprised with the amount of work involved
1396800 its the more focused mature student who does best in an online environment
1396801 feel its important that students have the emotional and social support
1396802 increase teacher training to make better use of web based resources
1396803 seek out volunteers or non credentialed monitors to reduce the cost of operating computer labs
1396804 the auctions give a sense that most of the time most things will sell if people thought they couldnt resell or that if they died their heirs couldnt sell many wouldnt buy a thing

1396806 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1396807 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1396808 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1396809 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1396810 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1396811 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1396812 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1396813 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1396814 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1396815 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1396816 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1396817 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1396818 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1396819 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
1396820 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
1396821 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
1396822 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
1396823 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
1396824 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
1396825 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one

1396839 your skunking story was funny and i can relate last fall we must have had several families of skunks in our neighborhood even after being skunked my border collie todd ran outside one morning to find a baby skunk on my front porch trying to get out of the rain being that todds a border collie he herded that little rascal right through my front door where todd me and my entire house were skunked after lots of screaming cursing and calling animal control i finally threw an old towel over the baby stinker picked him up and deposited him on my sidewalk needless to say i missed work that day de skunking
1396840 my guess is that the dog wouldnt call his scrubbing a reward my son in law sears that he still smells skunky when hes wet

1396894 there is variety in our game but theres no driving for instance we didnt want to spend the time creating a racing game what ive found in the past is that if you do too much you can create a shallow experience as opposed to really focussing on the core gameplay
1396895 further down the line i guess driving might be considered but thats not what were doing with this game
1396896 production has not reached the critical stage the company is very reasonable thanks to my achievements in the past so although i do get pressurised thats not happened yet and thats something i feel gratitude for that the company gives us the opportunity to focus by giving us time

1396916 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1396917 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1396918 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1397103 there has definitely been an increase in the volume of harassment and now weve seen an increase in the stakes of the violence that theyre willing to spread in the name of this cause
1397104 but as far as who did it and whether theyre the same people thats something that only time and investigation will determine
1397105 we do have some viable leads that were working on
1397106 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing
1397107 this behavior is antithetical to the core principles of the humane movement

1397111 a billion pound fortune buys you many things it seems including as we learned last week immunity from prosecution for possessing crack cocaine and heroin
1397112 first there are tip offs these bust big shipments and generate wonderful headlines but barely put a dent in supply second are operations against street dealers they take weeks of police time and within hours of dealers being taken off the street others have replaced them what has been used and must be used again is co ordinated action to take out entire supply chains from import to street dealer ive seen it succeed in north london in an operation involving the former national criminal intelligence service ncis the security services the mets drug squad and local officers with the use of intelligence undercover officers and street coppering everyone from importer to street dealer can be identified and prosecuted
1397113 thats why im in favour of what i call smarter enforcement involving more intelligence more research and more dialogue
1397114 at what point do we start to look at legalisation as an exit strategy in a war we cannot win is it possible to turn drugs into a health rather than a crime issue or should we blame britains excess of tolerance for turning it into one of the most drug blighted countries in europe as one leading expert neil mckeganey of glasgow university puts it at what point do we stop regarding illegal drug use as human right and start seeing drugs as a destructive social cancer these are uncomfortable questions for both the left and the right but it is time we started asking them we have to accept that this is no longer an argument about drug availability this is about the existence of a drug culture that has spread to every corner of society the poor old police can plug away at reducing supply until they are exhausted but they cannot begin to address something that undermines them at every turn
1397115 is dedicated to men and women who are seeking answers to the most important question of our time how to keep our families and our country safe and secure
1397116 maybe its time that our own leaders look the problem squarely in the eye and ask if drug prohibition is really the right strategy after all the issue recalls another historical parallel the american prohibition of alcohol from 1920 1933 during alcohol prohibition there were powerful gangsters such as al capone and bugs moran who distributed the prohibited substances and fought with each other and with the u s government the argument for legalization is that at least it would take the big money out of the drug trade and drug addicts could be treated as patients and not as criminals legalization is not a perfect solution the real solution is that people dont abuse drugs but whether you have prohibition legalization or something in between its likely that there will always be drug abusers the trick is to stop these addicts from dragging down the rest of our societies with them
1397117 in short the law has essentially made itself irrelevant if anything the law benefits the business to a large extent the industry is profitable precisely because it is illegal all entrepreneurs take risks but if the risks include jail time only the boldest entrepreneurs will enter the business and theyll demand a premium for the extra risk the net result of our irrational drug policies is that we enrich the criminals and criminalize ordinary citizens we control tobacco and alcohol far more effectively than we control any illegal drugs if those are the results we want these policies are perfect

1397120 discernable continuity continues to be the critical issue in cold chain distribution for pharmaceuticals
1397121 previous environmental and temperature control concerns for legitimate products are now coupled with supply chain threats from expired adulterated and prohibited gray market and counterfeit merchandise the solution may rest in layered security intertwined with environmental control technologies and essential government industry partnerships
1397122 we have a firm belief that the most efficient value proposition for creating a safe and secure supply chain is the incorporation of both product quality and the actual product authentication at this very critical time the pharmaceutical supply chain is re evaluating its collective options regarding pedigree rules and counterfeiting as they relate to brand protection

1397134 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
1397135 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
1397136 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
1397137 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end

1397143 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own

1397145 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
1397146 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
1397147 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
1397148 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
1397149 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
1397150 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
1397151 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
1397152 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
1397153 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
1397154 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
1397155 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
1397156 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
1397157 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
1397158 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
1397159 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
1397160 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
1397161 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
1397162 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
1397163 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
1397164 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
1397165 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

1397177 i am convinced by the contents of the cd and i went by my conscience to give it to the speaker and release it to the media
1397178 like media i have a right to protect the identity of my source
1397179 it was later pointed out to me that the visual of somebody called sanjeev saxena entering argals house as shown in the cd was shot after july 22 if this is the case then the matter becomes all the more serious as it shows that both congress and bjp are united on the issue of nuclear deal
1397180 they both are pro us and therefore in favour of the deal had the government fallen they would have ensured that the deal comes through left is against the deal as it is anti us
1397181 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape
1397182 we have not been provided with the evidence that would show us that this is an impossibility nor does it answer the question of why arent we working on this for next time
1397183 the point is the law needs to be adhered to and the governor is saying we need to follow the law and if the controller is saying its inconvenient i think the controller needs to explain why inconvenience is a reason to ignore the law
1397184 its certainly not a language that is taught oftentimes you have to rely on retired annuitants to come back and help maintain the system until youre able to find a replacement
1397185 rss vhp bajrang dal and hindu mahasabha leaders form the core of the sangharsh samiti spearheading the agitation in jammu against revocation of land to amarnath shrine board and are backing the agitation they have the support of bjp
1397186 if the bjp is a responsible national party they should try and understand what the implications are for india
1397187 national parties do not realise that j amp k is a sensitive state this is like playing into the hands of those forces who want to weaken india
1397188 negotiations cannot be held in a vitiated atmosphere we are looking for an amicable solution acceptable to all

1397303 do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software
1397304 in recent years certain open source software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our license based software model
1397305 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products
1397306 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the european commissions decision issued on march 24 2004

1397312 the only limit on our involvement was prime minister malikis rightful concern that the operation was seen by the people of basra to be iraqi led
1397313 it is nonsense to suggest that this hampered uk support to the operation
1397314 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1397315 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1397316 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1397317 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1397318 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1397319 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1397320 we have worked for some years to develop the ability for our carebot msrs to intelligently listen and respond to spoken commands of the caregiver and or care receiver geckochat can be readily customized for words and phrases recognized and for words phrases and sentences that would be appropriate responses in affect the family can now create a unique personality for their family members by choosing the cadence tonality breathiness etc of the voice synthesis in addition to the various family anecdotes and colloquialisms specifically selected for the care receivers benefit geckochat continues the development of fundamental functional benefits needed to cost effectively provide utility to families for remote care taking of their members and other loved ones this will benefit all our stakeholders and improve roi for our investors

1397331 rupert murdoch announced the news corporation would invest 100 million in six regional television channels in india and he unveiled a new dow jones index to track indian stock markets
1397332 throughout the 2007 growing season we continued to see signs in support of that a severe drought in the southeast and the early mid september freeze in the upper midwest in early january the global meteorological society agreed that we had made a transition from el ni o to la ni a
1397333 the drought in australia that impacted wheat production last fall and the unusually high amounts of precipitation in southern california and arizona in december 300 percent to 600 percent of normal were very uncharacteristic of la ni as
1397334 there was not a great deal happening in terms of plant development and growth
1397335 by the beginning of june we were still seeing a crop far behind where it should have been for that time of year
1397336 typically we have some area of the state that has crop problems
1397337 but this year its not confined to just one area the flooding and the wet field conditions occurred all across the midwest but iowa is probably the hardest hit the western illinois and nebraska areas have the best crop outlooks at this time the poorest crop outlook is in central iowa north central iowa and eastern and southeastern iowa
1397338 due to all the rainfall we probably had the worst erosion weve had in years
1397339 its been estimated that 30 percent of the corn crop will not be mature by the normal frost dates and the ramifications of that will include a potential cut in crop yields and an extended timeframe for harvest higher than normal moisture content higher drying costs and the potential for lower grain quality
1397340 i dont think weve lost 10 percent in the river bottoms like weve heard and were just tickled to death to have what we have right now which is corn from 6 inches tall to 6 feet tall
1397341 it was starting to go to pot last year the farm to market roads turned to junk we have four semis that haul to the mississippi river and they have to use a lot of extra fuel to go many miles around its going to take months and months to get these roads back into the shape we need
1397342 it reminds me of the sharks that are still out there trying to get a bigger piece of the farmers pie
1397343 if we do that again this year our corn production costs could get to 5 per bushel since wall street doesnt seem to have much of a conscience and companies always have to beat the previous year in terms of profits were going to see fertilizer and seed go even higher than it has
1397344 farmers are just waiting for the next shark to show up and take another piece out of the pie were frustrated out there were thankful that no one in our area was killed in the flood
1397345 will help carry us through this situation well know more as the crops grow at this point we do expect to meet all our needs and still have a modest carryover at the end of the marketing year
1397346 trying to stay one step ahead of rust is getting to be quite an ordeal
1397347 i think over time we are going to have a continuing cyclical problem with rust and fungicides will help reduce losses during those times
1397348 we are anticipating it is going to show up this year or the next
1397349 to date we louisiana growers havent used all the allocation we have
1397350 there is not much sod farmers can do about this aspect of production
1397351 growers are optimistic but as the cost of production goes up some of the cost has to pass on to consumers
1397352 the business is tough at times but its been good to me and i would quit if i didnt like what i was doing

1397450 but it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places in relation to the housing market there is no doubt that a combination of peoples general mood and outlook and the fact that mortgage finance has been constrained is pushing prices down

1397502 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1397503 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1397504 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1397505 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1397506 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1397507 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1397508 the crowd is going to be huge for the chinese

1397541 i already play for the guy and here i am feeling like im trying out for him it was like i was trying to impress him
1397542 a lot of people in the nba are careful about what they say to guys because they dont want to get on their bad side roy said

1397547 he came back from working out and told me he wanted to take me to look at rings so he could get an idea of what i liked bardwell said
1397548 but he said he wanted to take a nap first after he woke up he said he wanted to eat before we left and so he went downstairs
1397549 then he sent me a text and said to look in his drawer in his closet he said if you find something you can have it
1397550 i sent a text back saying what are you talking about
1397551 im pulling out all these portland jerseys and then at the bottom there was a box bardwell said

1397561 we all get caught up in determining what position is everybody pritchard said
1397562 i mean do you call him a point guard because he is handling the ball i dont worry about whether a guy is a point guard or not i want to know if he is a playmaker because you are either a playmaker or you are not and brandon is definitely a playmaker
1397563 i like the way he plays his aggressiveness more than anything i like his attitude winning is an attitude and i think jerryd brings that i can tell by the way he plays that he wants to be the best
1397564 the reason why i see me playing with jerryd is because he can guard points roy said
1397565 he may not be a one but he can guard a one so then it fits into exactly what we want to do
1397566 hes a little bit smaller but hes tough and he guards and i think the biggest thing i like about him is he is confident in this league you gotta be
1397567 his confidence is more loud and mine is more quiet
1397568 but i like his game if he wants to be aggressive and he makes plays then i dont mind being the point and if im in an aggressive play making mode then im sure he doesnt mind being the point
1397569 blake he understands playing with good players he played with carmelo and iverson in denver and as the year went on he was able to help me roy said
1397570 there were moments when hed be on me saying this is your turn your time you cant be looking at everybody you cant be passive i thought that helped because it made me feel like the team wants me to do this and i didnt want to let them down so i had to become more aggressive
1397571 if sergio doesnt play well as the quote on quote backup point it wont hurt that bad because like last year roy handled the ball and blake or jack played shooting guard in crunch time
1397572 i dont think i would be where i am today without d
1397573 coming home is tough to deal with your friends there are so many requests i just get to the point where i hang out here home all the time
1397574 in portland i can kind of fly under the radar roy said
1397575 there is not as much family its easier to stay away in a bit the people in seattle act like they know me and people in portland are more like a fan like brandon its going to be great where the people here its like i have to be careful everybody wants to be my best friend

1397593 as any firm that has attempted to transform its workforce to meet changing conditions will attest the journey is difficult and littered with obstacles understanding key workforce performance challenges and identifying the leading practices companies are using to overcome them have become central focus areas
1397594 manufacturing is still more relevant to long term economic development than glitzy museums or massive sports stadiums
1397595 people in our business are getting older and we need to develop the next generation of leaders
1397596 given the departure of older employees the smaller number of generation y employees who will be replacing them and the increasing demand for talent around the globe attracting and retaining talent is likely to become more rather than less of a challenge
1397597 i saw the angel in the marble and carved until i set him free

1397601 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1397602 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1397603 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1397604 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1397605 from the time they step off the plane in beijing athletes visitors and members of the media will be protected by vesda throughout their entire olympics experience
1397606 vesdas unique ability to detect the earliest presence of smoke will protect some of beijings key buildings and critical parts of the mass transit systems and help preserve the safety of these historic olympic games
1397607 because they monitor web traffic and detect attacks web application firewalls should help developers find and fix flaws in production code but in reality the process is too tedious and costly
1397608 in contrast impervas web activity monitoring solution feeds alerts and reports to both security and development teams closing the loop between security operations and application developers
1397609 historically web application firewalls have focused on reducing threats to online applications while code review and vulnerability scanning technologies have focused on discovering vulnerabilities
1397610 with web activity monitoring securesphere closes this gap by blocking malicious inputs and capturing detailed information on how applications respond to live queries which allows developers to fix code level security holes

1397617 thats probably the single biggest thing people have got to get over is this notion that innovation is this very unique disruptive thing
1397618 if i have such a narrow view of innovation then what happens is that i dont do a lot of it
1397619 while microsoft battled linux and apple to hold on to the desktop google and open source walked away with the web a bigger prize

1397622 floridas clean energy future will benefit floridas economy environment and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1397623 every single customer we have is able to take that tax credit
1397624 projects have to be finished and operating before they can take that tax credit
1397625 no commercial entity that weve done would touch it without the tax credit its a huge amount of money they save
1397626 our industry on a large scale is being harmed by the fact republicans and democrats cant seem to get on the same page whatsoever
1397627 i clearly understand the major role that renewable sources of energy must play in our national energy policy unfortunately we could write a blank check to the renewable fuels industry today and still not meet our countrys massive need for energy

1397646 this is what the government said we would do before the election
1397647 we said we would bring forward water purchasing and thats what were doing
1397648 so we are simply rolling out the water purchase program as we were elected to do and as we committed to do prior to the election
1397649 we actually purchased high security water as well as general security and low security water so we did purchase high security water in the murray
1397650 we assessed the offers put to us by sellers on the basis of value for money which included an assessment of how environmentally valuable they would be so well approach this new purchase in the same way
1397651 vietnams illegal trade in wildlife continues unabated and affects neighbouring countries
1397652 hanoi is the cultural and political centre of vietnam where wildlife protection and conservation policies are issued and implemented
1397653 this suggests that the gap between policies and implementation of wildlife protection is still big
1397654 many high profile animals of global conservation concern such as tigers bears or rhinos can still be bought on the market provided prior notice is given and that the price negotiated is high enough
1397655 any type of medicinal animal if ordered sufficiently in advance
1397656 i realize my purpose is to console to personally wipe away tears through selfless love compassion and service
1397657 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort
1397658 our country faces a critical challenge because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis is eating into the budgets of families across north dakota
1397659 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us
1397660 anybody who says we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1397661 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
1397662 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
1397663 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
1397664 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1397665 require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1397666 the polar ice caps are shrinking causing sea levels to rise extreme weather is wreaking havoc across the globe droughts are becoming more severe tropical diseases are migrating north and numerous species are being threatened with extinction
1397667 senator obama has no plan to address the energy challenges we face as a nation he has said no to offshore drilling no to domestic drilling and no to nuclear energy he has no plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1397668 the plan senator obama is announcing today is a much better approach while not perfect senator obamas proposal is a serious response to our nations most pressing energy problems it includes support for plug in hybrid vehicles a national renewable electricity standard and a low carbon fuel standard among other solutions senator obama should focus on continuing to advocate real solutions and avoid yielding to oil companies and allowing more offshore drilling
1397669 consumers want to buy vehicles that get more than 30 miles per gallon
1397670 we are only a few months away from the expiration theres a lot of anxiety disappointment and frustration
1397671 the viability of solana is predicated on passing the extension of this itc investment tax credit
1397672 we do feel fairly confident that it will be addressed
1397673 but at some point we cant just keep going forward unless we know this subsidy will be there
1397674 i dont know what it will be but i think they will get there
1397675 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump
1397676 yeah 10 years from now two cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
1397677 a momentum is occurring growing numbers of people are interested in being peaceful the action of peace is being peace since we began in june 2008 weve already reached people around the globe in 44 countries and in every u s state
1397678 peace is fun when people are peaceful they laugh a lot they take care of each other they share resources and are open to new and diverse ideas peaceful life is good life its spontaneous generous and wildly creative its an art and skill
1397679 obama can call himself anything he likes but there is a clear requirement for one to qualify as a christian and obama doesnt meet that requirement
1397680 a bridge between god and man and one that i think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher
1397681 yeah although i retain from my childhood and my experiences growing up a suspicion of dogma and im not somebody who is always comfortable with that language that implies ive got a monopoly on the truth or that my faith is automatically transferable to others
1397682 the difficult thing about any religion including christianity is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize theres the belief certainly in some quarters that if people havent embraced jesus christ as their personal savior theyre going to hell
1397683 lord protect my family and me forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
1397684 a christian is a person who trusts in the redemptive work of god in christ and seeks to live that out
1397685 i do believe that there is an existential relationship with god that transcends even what we say
1397686 heres a special photo radiating abundant love hank harris zachariah daly is wearing a christening dress made by his maternal great great grandmother elizabeth and i both wore it and a coat made by her maternal great grandmother and the bonnet was worn by matt this blessing was done at sacred heart monastery in cullman al i have dear friends that are sisters there because elizabeth played these holy grounds as a child she wanted to have hank christened there
1397687 i want you to look in the mirror and say
1397688 megan meiers death was a terrible tragedy and there is an understandable desire to hold the defendant somehow accountable for it if defendants conduct was as alleged
1397689 but a dangerously overbroad construction of the cfaa would criminalize the everyday conduct of millions of internet users the novel indeed unprecedented in the history of the cfaa interpretation of advanced in the indictment cannot be squared with the plain language of the statute its legislative history and the constitutional requirements that criminal statutes provide citizens fair notice avoid vagueness and comport with the first amendment consequently amici urge the court to dismiss the indictment
1397690 serious encroachment on fundamental civil liberties including freedom of speech the first amendment assures the right to speak anonymously online
1397691 carefully identifying speech that falls outside of first amendment protection neither of those statutes appears to criminalize the
1397692 is when does access to a highly popular everyday website is without authorization or in excess of authorized access
1397693 the plain language of the cfaa does not criminalize an account holders use of a computer in violation of terms of service or tos but a trespassers access to computer systems or areas of computer networks without permission in other words the statute prohibits trespass and theft not improper motive or use
1397694 is a consensus bill aimed at deterring and punishing certain high tech crimes
1397695 legislative history confirms that congress intended the cfaa to criminalize intruders who trespassed on computers and computer networks and does not cover improper motive or use
1397696 run the risk that her continued use of the site could lead to criminal sanctions
1397697 the way she used her account if the allegations are true was reprehensible
1397698 but unless her hateful speech rises to the level of harassment or stalking it is not criminal and cannot be punished attempting instead to punish that speech under the cfaa merely because it took place on the internet in contravention to a private terms of service is improper
1397699 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning

1397722 all women should feel safe turning to the police for help without fear that such an encounter will result in injury
1397723 for a police officer to injure an innocent woman undermines both public safety and constitutional protections
1397724 we think that the police should be held accountable if they use strong arm tactics against individuals who do not need to be restrained and have not committed any crime
1397725 they should certainly know that they cannot detain someone without probable cause the court needs to hold them accountable
1397726 within the limits of a public highway without first obtaining the written consent of the chief of police
1397727 the statute makes no mention of traffic safety or any other purpose justifying the restrictions and sets forth no standards based on the characteristics of a proposed sign the states assertion that the statute sets forth clear standards is simply not supported by the plain language of the statute
1397728 ultimately allowing the statute to stand would be an endorsement of a trust me because i am the chief of police standard
1397729 when we forget how to turn the soil with our hands we forget who we are
1397730 i still dont know how it will play out with this one

1397759 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
1397760 t he experience was a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces
1397761 the drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequences of other economic changes
1397762 throughout the contraction the system had ample powers to cut short the tragic process of monetary deflation and banking collapse had it used those powers effectively in late 1930 or even in early to mid 1931 such action would have eased the severity of the contraction and very likely would have brought it to an end at a much earlier date

1397764 our officials will go to beijing we will definitely implement all good lessons learnt from the beijing olympics however let me say that we are very much on track for the commonwealth games thanks to the asiad in 1982 delhi already has a solid infrastructure for sports in place these are being refurbished delhis overall infrastructure is also being upgraded with a deadline of 2010 in addition to better metro connectivity we will have 5 000 to 6 000 modern buses plying in the city by then
1397765 today most of delhis infrastructure projects whether its the modernisation of the airport construction of metro link to the airport or the games village all are linked to the games its a global phenomenon such big sports events act as a stimulus for fast track completion of mega infrastructure projects overcoming routine political and bureaucratic hurdles
1397766 i think a lot of people are watching to see whether we will succeed
1397767 if we can do something they havent been able to do up to this point they may follow suit
1397768 if we can feel the love from the fans i would say its o k to leave it

1397973 we need to be asking ourselves some pretty tough questions about why almost 1000 kids are being chucked out of primary schools for behaviour that is just so bad that schools have got to the point where they wont even work with it
1397974 but its when you look deeper into those statistics and you start to tease them out that you get a different kind of view of the world

1398015 given the known gaps and variations in care for patients infected with hiv aids and hepatitis b and c it is imperative that the medical community begin to systematically measure itself at the individual clinician and system level to identify where improvement efforts are needed
1398016 the nqf process is instrumental for endorsing a single set of consensus standards that will help alleviate the multiple competing sets of measures for hiv aids and hepatitis against which clinicians are currently measured this supports our ultimate aim a uniform standard of care that every consumer can expect
1398017 all stakeholders including employers physicians and the government are looking for endorsed standards like these perioperative performance measures that are feasible reliable and valid
1398018 nqf is recognized as the principal body in the united states for the endorsement of healthcare performance and quality measures the newly endorsed perioperative performance measures on a clinical level will be the driving force for improvement in both processes and health outcomes for patients
1398019 nqf endorsement of these measures is important because patients healthcare needs are frequently complex and require treatment from an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals
1398020 nqf endorsement of these non physician measures is an important step forward in performance measurement and public reporting
1398021 for health plans nqf endorsed indicators provide a framework that can be used for measuring performance and then collaborating with providers to improve care
1398022 the new nqf endorsed measures for non physician professionals will help expand these activities to a broader group of medical professionals
1398023 by endorsing these measures nqf has taken a solid step forward toward ensuring evidence based practice that supports the needs of stroke patients across the continuum of care
1398024 as the third most common cause of death and the number one cause of adult disability stroke is a disease that commands our attention
1398025 the harmonization of measures achieved by the nqf committee will hopefully result in a more clear understanding of the utilization of these important vaccines
1398026 setting standards for how we measure vaccination rates will help us raise the bar
1398027 not only will we know how many people are accepting vaccinations but also how many are refusing them this way we can improve our strategies for vaccination set targets for improving rates and measure our success in addition the new health care worker standard is an important first step to increasing vaccination rates in this group which would reduce the spread of influenza in health care settings

1398062 the average household bin is one third food waste rather than send it to landfill or an incinerator we can turn it into a gas called biomethane and run our municipal vehicle fleet on it biomethane means virtually no carbon or noxious emissions so its good for the environment and for our air quality this seemed like a dream 18 months ago when camdens sustainability taskforce suggested it but now were trialling both food waste collections and biomethane in our vehicles its a sign that the council is serious about cutting the carbon out of camden
1398063 the gas we use to make the cbm for this vehicle comes from a landfill site in albury surrey which began production in june 2008 in creating and selling this fuel product we recover the latent energy stored in material discarded by society providing power particularly suited to vehicles operating in the urban environment

1398161 action on smoking and health ash a washington d c based national anti smoking group called banning smoking in homes the next front in the war on smoking and cited a new survey showing that a majority of people in ireland expressed support for a total ban on smoking in homes and cars
1398162 according to a new survey 57 of the people in ireland support a ban on smoking in all homes and cars
1398163 as politicians in many states continue to debate whether to ban smoking in restaurants bars casinos and other public places it looks like legislators are once again far behind the growing public sentiment for smoking bans and also far behind how far judges and regulatory agencies are willing to go says banzhaf since restrictions of smoking are one of the most effective and virtually the least expensive way to help smokers quit it is no surprise that there is growing support for smoking restrictions even if no nonsmokers health is being put at risk by the smoking smoking restrictions even if no nonsmokers health is being put at risk by the smoking
1398164 that would be a complete invasion of privacy and autonomy it would represent completely unenlightened paternalism public health practitioners need to remember that there are other important values that need to be preserved in society beyond merely getting people to stop smoking we also need to make sure that our interventions respect individual autonomy freedom and privacy banning smoking in homes to reduce smoking rates violates all three of these principles
1398165 what scares me most about ashs latest pronouncement is not merely ashs support for this policy i dont think that ashs support alone would be enough to convince policy makers to enact such policies
1398166 i must also say that ash is making the pronouncements of smoking ban opponents look good

1398532 novak djokovic o roger federer son los favoritos porque la pista se les da mejor despu s estamos el resto
1398533 en la villa ol mpica estamos muy bien es una experiencia muy distinta a la que estamos habituados vas conociendo al resto de deportistas la acogida ha sido muy buena todos se han portado muy bien con nosotros
1398534 no creo que el recibimiento fuera de n mero uno llevo a os ah arriba puede ser m s por ganar wimbledon o roland garros el n mero uno es m s importante pero m s ganar wimbledon
1398535 no cambia nada ir de uno o de dos en un cuadro lo nico que supone es haber cumplido un objetivo y tocar esta situaci n despu s de los a os que llevo eso es muy bonito y es una gran ilusi n

1398544 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1398545 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination

1398573 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
1398574 maybe a client just needs their legs tanned because they want to wear shorts or need to have certain areas addressed more than others to minimize the appearance of cellulite or varicose veins or even get rid of unsightly tan lines that show when wearing their wedding gown or any special occasion dress
1398575 its a great way to achieve a suntanned appearance without the harmful side effects of sun exposure
1398576 if you have sensitive skin or a low tolerance for pain you may want to take a mild over the counter pain killer prior to body waxing
1398577 alcohol and or caffeine in the blood stream increases sensitivity to waxing and may result in a more painful treatment
1398578 shaving is a form of exfoliation so yes shaving will cause your tan to fade a bit quicker

1398584 mediasilo was born from a production environment so our workflow is custom tailored to casting workflows

1398588 estimating how much space is required for a given duration and codec is something that many video editors need to do on a regular basis our videospace widget has been proved to be a big hit with editors and were very excited to make disk space calculations available from any computer with an internet connection including iphone and ipod touch

1398596 he was the ultimate con man handsome rich smooth and with a celebrity girlfriend to make him seem legit
1398597 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1398598 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1398599 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1398600 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1398601 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1398602 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1398603 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1398604 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1398605 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1398606 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1398607 web 2 0 might make sense we agreed that it did and so the web 2 0 is a term describing the trend in the use of folksonomies although the term suggests a new version of the world wide web it does not refer to an update to any technical specifications but to changes in the ways platform and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform
1398608 as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects
1398609 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1398610 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1398611 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1398612 although i have never kept any reptiles or probably never will i did find it an interesting read
1398613 you can keep your choreographed altar servers liturgical dance is here to stay
1398614 a lot of parents over buy for their children and during an economic crunch they will clean out their closets
1398615 we have a great selection of in season clothes right now
1398616 another good option is to only buy the basics before school starts and then once the kids are back in school see what is popular with their friends go back for the trendy stuff later
1398617 maybe a client just needs their legs tanned because they want to wear shorts or need to have certain areas addressed more than others to minimize the appearance of cellulite or varicose veins or even get rid of unsightly tan lines that show when wearing their wedding gown or any special occasion dress
1398618 its a great way to achieve a suntanned appearance without the harmful side effects of sun exposure
1398619 if you have sensitive skin or a low tolerance for pain you may want to take a mild over the counter pain killer prior to body waxing
1398620 alcohol and or caffeine in the blood stream increases sensitivity to waxing and may result in a more painful treatment

1398622 ich schwebe im himmel ich bin ein gl cklicher mensch
1398623 these young ladies have not expressed any desire to be with their mother or her family
1398624 that todays young couple prefer to move in together for a few years just to see if it will work what this law does is confirm youre married and everyone pays for the seperation
1398625 marriage is being imposed on everyone whether they like it or not
1398626 take the case of a woman in her 50s who has not worked for 20 years and has raised the children
1398627 she is deserted by her de facto husband who earns half a million dollars a year currently the court looks only at her contribution during the past 20 years rather than her future financial needs in the division of property that is not the case with a married woman
1398628 i came into the relationship with a certain amount and i dont want to make money out of it

1398657 the chances of any normal human being taking the time to add incredibly valuable meta data to the great wads of digital data they create daily approximates zero
1398658 most people would prefer root canal work than the utter tedium and ambient feeling of futility that accompanies meta data creation besides everyone is too busy oh and besides that again it always seems to be more fun to create new stuff than to create stuff about old stuff
1398659 any gadget technique or service that adds even vaguely useful meta data without requiring significant human intervention will find a very receptive market out there

1398694 earlier today i sent out a message prohibiting the use of cell phones at that time i was not able to share with you the reason i can now cell phone technology has come a long way in recent years the ability to track a cell phone using gps and triangulation provides a capability to locate a cell phone within meters of a point this morning indirect fire rounds hit one of the sites where we live and work there was a fatality a review of the scene later revealed that a cell phone was used immediately prior to and after the attack an outgoing call and two incoming calls the phone was found within meters of the impact area

1398703 we have made arrangements to cut the number of self promoting commercials and phone sex ads down to only three per dvd
1398704 when people ask me what i do on the internet i tell them that i teach studios and webmasters how to make money
1398705 cest une victoire pour la d mocratie fran aise je men r jouis profond ment
1398706 the problem is that dopey guys with no clue whove maybe been to an s amp m club once try and do this lack of experience is still a problem im a one man focus group this is my native sexuality i know what my crowd likes what they dont like and what they think looks and feels authentic
1398707 what the bdsm audience doesnt like is an attempt to get their money
1398708 someone who dresses a girl in a collar and a leash and sticks that on a box cover and it contains maybe two seconds of something fetishy well the audience just pukes that up
1398709 you can direct somebody dressed in latex but its a lot more than that
1398710 you have to be on the inside to know what the consumer wants to see
1398711 i also do a thing on niteflirt com thats phone sex and thats really given me a lot of ideas theyll tell me what theyre into and im like holy shit i wouldnt have thought of that on my own
1398712 its like going to the same high school or something and its similar with the fans fetish people tend to be more loyal the fetish guys will like me when im 40 and they feel that way about their product
1398713 the s amp m audience tends to be people with a high iq
1398714 theyre not easily sold on a bunch of poseur bullshit
1398715 i think the fetish world both on and off the internet will be fine because its such a specific thing
1398716 theres nothing vanilla about fetish in straight porn whose stuff really stands out when they use the same people doing the same sex acts and the only way to differentiate yourself is to beat the girl up or shove 12 things up her butt and make it the most nonsexual anti female product that you can distribute
1398717 and i tell them what i want and the slave will tell me what his or her boundaries are and then ill push them during the scene to take them to the edge we have a safety word to signal if things are going too far there is no safety word in straight porn in the fetish world theres no anti female no one is thinking of a girl in the i hate you way the master loves his girl he doesnt want to break her so she cant work the next day or put her in a mental institution because of what hes doing to her
1398718 i think the more mainstream you get unless youre a big star the way you get treated is a little bit worse
1398719 in the fetish world you never disrespect anybody you can be choking someone and if they say the safe word you stop even if youre two seconds from coming you dont want them to be hurt or damaged or bruised theres a code of ethics in the community filming or otherwise
1398720 it concerns me that there are people making these movies that do not have that experience or are not willing to pay for it
1398721 there are certain kinds of ethics in bondage particularly with people that are new to it where we need to explain everything were going to do show them every piece of equipment were going to use show them that its going to be safe and comfortable and ask them how they are with it and if theyre uncomfortable we dont do it there are a million options when youre shooting bondage there are alternatives to doing the gag if its something they dont want to do
1398722 i believe fully that bdsm is female empowerment if you use it as such

1398726 the discoveries are meaningful because it has been difficult to link genes to mental illness with a great deal of confidence
1398727 its unlikely that one gene will explain the development of any mental illness and in the case of schizophrenia we strongly suspect that multiple genes are responsible for an increased vulnerability for the disorder
1398728 there are no genetic tests for schizophrenia although that could change in the future
1398729 however genes are influenced by many factors so having a gene that may be related to schizophrenia does not necessarily mean a person will develop the condition
1398730 this study represent the fruition of nearly 10 years of work as i and other collaborators in the department have been involved in the molecular genetics of schizophrenia consortium
1398731 this paper helps show that molecular genetics work today is collaborative and international it takes many years to collect cases and the subsequent genetic analysis is not easy the methods are constantly evolving in fact the methods used in this study were not the ones we originally proposed in the 1990s
1398732 while the vast majority of respondents said board certification is important to them most didnt understand the meaning of board certification
1398733 sixty percent incorrectly believe that a doctor has to be board certified to practice medicine and only 45 percent of survey respondents had ever checked to see if their doctor is board certified board certification is actually a voluntary process a doctor undertakes to demonstrate a commitment to lifelong learning and proficiency in his or her medical specialty
1398734 communication skills are increasingly recognized as an essential component of quality healthcare and not something thats nice but not necessary
1398735 these survey findings confirm that patients are demanding that their doctors treat them not just with medicines and procedures but with empathy and information that they understand
1398736 weve learned that apoe genotype does not tell the whole genetic story
1398737 other genes may be acting independently of apoe to influence someones risk for developing the disease
1398738 over an average of seven and a half years of observation the people who experienced the most significant cognitive decline had a family history of the disease and one or more copies of apoe e4
1398739 this decline was greater among those with both risk factors which suggests theres another underlying genetic contribution to the risk of alzheimers disease
1398740 for this reason researchers should focus not only on people at risk because of the apoe gene but also those who have a family history of alzheimers disease conversely studying those who survive to late old age without disease is important to discover genes that may offer protection against the disease
1398741 these data provide further evidence that we must explore other genetic avenues to learn more about who is at risk for cognitive decline and dementia
1398742 its way too easy to take the lack of parenting that comes with going to college and become an overgrown child who eats snickers bars for meals
1398743 alcohol has a lot of calories when you drink alcohol your resistance to everything goes down including your resistance to temptation of fatty foods you tend to eat more when you drink
1398744 it clears the mind and its great for getting into the right mental place for studying
1398745 exercise testing in oncology research has skyrocketed in the past ten years yet until now no one has evaluated the quality of the tests
1398746 we reviewed studies that performed exercise testing among adults with cancer and found most studies did not follow the guidelines recommended for clinical settings
1398747 we also found that studies typically do not report key physiological outcomes that provide immediate information on the fitness level in a particular cancer population or whether the test was valid
1398748 while we still do not know the clinical application of exercise testing outside of lung cancer patients it is evident that the use of exercise testing will continue to expand in oncology research
1398749 several recent studies reported a strong association between increased levels of exercise and significant reductions in cancer recurrence and cancer mortality among patients with colon and breast cancer
1398750 as the level of evidence continues to grow the need for exercise testing will grow in parallel
1398751 we need to develop a plan for nationally and internationally mandated recommendations specific to the clinical and research applications of exercise testing for oncology patients
1398752 conceded production had been moved offshore with a plan to resume filming next year
1398753 well its been postponed indefinitely and it keeps getting postponed and each time it gets postponed the chances of it getting made seem to decrease its never been officially over so theres always that in a heartbeat i would drop whatever i had going on to do that that movie and what i get to do in it is like nothing ive ever seen or would ever get a chance to do again
1398754 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1398755 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1398756 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1398757 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control
1398758 people should avoid the risk factors for gerd we strongly believe that the rise in asthma particularly among adults in the country is in large measure due to lifestyle choices that can be changed
1398759 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1398760 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1398761 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura while it is too early to start testing young women with migraine with aura for this gene variant more focused research will help us to understand these complex links and will help us to potentially develop preventative strategies
1398762 doctors should try to reduce heart disease risk factors and advise young women who experience migraine with aura not to smoke and to consider birth control pill alternatives as these increase the risk of ischemic vascular problems
1398763 after accounting for other key predictors of dementia we found that statin users were about half as likely to develop dementia as those who did not take them
1398764 our participants were fairly typical older people with lots of diabetes hypertension and heart disease
1398765 until our study enrolled them they had never had their memory tested
1398766 we arent suggesting that people should take statins unless they are necessary for other reasons we hope this study and others like it will open the door to trials that would test the ability of statins to prevent dementia and other types of cognitive impairment
1398767 health care providers should consider testing their older patients with diabetes or hypertension for cognitive impairment and memory loss
1398768 more research needs to be done to confirm these results especially since it was a small study
1398769 but these results should also get the attention of women with migraine and their doctors since topiramate is also used for preventing migraine which is an even more common condition that also occurs frequently in women of childbearing age

1398778 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd

1398870 you may be the biggest baddest man walking the planet but tonight were going to find out how big and bad you really are
1398871 i think you are nothing more than a parasite you disgust me and i dont give a damn what my dad says or what you say im not leaving this ring unless of course you want to try to make me
1398872 no no no no there are a lot of things preventing that from happening we are co general managers we cannot lay a hand on a wwe superstar much less face one in a match
1398873 wait a minute you want a match no holds barred tonight youre on
1398874 theres not a damn thing you can do about it
1398875 but also in the same match will be chris jericho kevin nash randy orton and shawn michaels because the main event for the world title will be defended at summerslam in an elimination chamber now beat the hell out of each other
1398876 the only reason i lost that match is because of kevin nash big sexy youre a big stupid son of a bitch
1398877 im mr canada dammit and you dont treat me that way so im going to make it my quest to take something from you something youre so proud of its my quest to face you in a hair vs hair match and believe me when i tell you im going to shave you balder than a new born babys bare behind daddio
1398878 youre going to make my a life a living hell huh thats what youre going to do

1398886 i wanted to debrief about the way we handled the toilet discussions
1398887 we have different understandings of the process of collective decision making once a decision has been made you follow through with what was decided you have to be careful not to be responsive to who is hitting their drum the loudest and the council must reserve the right to make resolutions as it sees fit
1398888 it is actually already in our bylaws but we just have not enforced it
1398889 we talked about it some months ago but it was voted against
1398890 we could try it on a trial period and see if banning liquor during certain times on the main street made any difference to the vandalism over the weekends
1398891 i went beyond the businesses on the main street and talked to a number of people who support the idea we have to listen to what everyone thinks not just the publicans
1398892 most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be
1398893 the by laws need to be as uniform as possible but some room is open for a certain amount of customisation
1398894 the intention of the by laws is not to be draconian enforcement should also be reasonable
1398895 no way is it going to cost you 200 a month its by far the cheapest form of heating
1398896 whether you were a small investor looking to build your nest egg by exercising your judgment on risk and return or a small entrepreneur seeking public capital to build your innovative new business paul atkins was looking out for you
1398897 he was a great advocate for publicly traded companies and their shareholders primarily because he realized that the interests of these two parties werent necessarily contradictory
1398898 he recognized early on that these fines make shareholders pay twice for corporate fraud
1398899 the sec policy has been largely changed to punish individual actors rather than the company as a whole due in substantial part to commissioner atkins arguments
1398900 paul atkins went into the public sector never forgetting the dynamism of the private sector as a result he remained in touch with the investors and entrepreneurs he was there to serve he utilized his private sector experience to provide a vital check on a large bureaucracy and he will continue to be an important voice on public policy

1398902 on a short term basis the burden of proof is probably on the bulls that they can generate enough buying interest to sustain something more than a 1 2 day rally
1398903 any such shift would not come without risks such as spooking investors if the fed came off too hawkish relative to increasingly fragile economic conditions especially after he widened those goal posts in recent monetary policy testimony
1398904 i dont think its that i guess i look on it as there are very few opportunities like we have right now or the kerry campaign had found years ago so we just want to work every day to take advantage of that opportunity

1398928 the president assured them that he will carry the message of freedom as he travels to beijing for the games just as he has regularly made this a priority in all of his meetings with chinese officials
1398929 welcomed the presidents strong commitment to human rights and religious freedom and urged him to continue to deliver that message not only to the chinese leadership but also to all the people of china
1398930 i was deeply honored to meet with the president and to hear his words of support for the uyghur people on the eve of the beijing olympics

1398935 as game budgets have swelled and public interest in gaming has expanded more games than ever transcend the stereotype of gaming as a juvenile pursuit with little artistic merit reminding us that games can be artistic expressions on par with books movies or songs critics whose gaming experience consists of having played pacman in an arcade may belittle gaming as a trivial pastime but anybody who has played bioshock or gears of war or oblivion knows better games can critique the harsh realities of modern society and offer insight into the nature of the human soul in ways that less interactive forms of media cannot

1398957 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1398958 our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1398959 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
1398960 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
1398961 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1398962 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1398963 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1398964 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1398965 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1398966 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1398967 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1398968 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1398969 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1398970 for the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
1398971 this provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process
1398972 one of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient poor environment
1398973 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
1398974 nitrogen is the element that most limits plant growth around the world
1398975 our work should help predict how much nitrogen becomes available when organic matter is added to the soil either naturally or through added mulches and manures
1398976 a diet rich in carbon causes microbes to release more carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide as they strive to maintain the healthy balance between nitrogen and carbon in their diet
1398977 for this reason if more carbon is added to the soil in the form of plant residues the microbes would then just pump out more carbon in response
1398978 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1398979 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1398980 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1398981 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming

1398985 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1398986 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1398987 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1398988 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential
1398989 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1398990 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1398991 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1398992 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1398993 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1398994 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1398995 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1398996 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1398997 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1398998 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1398999 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1399000 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1399001 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1399002 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1399003 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1399004 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
1399005 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
1399006 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia
1399007 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1399008 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1399009 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1399010 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1399011 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1399012 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1399013 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1399014 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1399015 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1399016 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1399017 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1399018 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1399019 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1399020 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1399021 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1399022 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1399023 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1399024 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1399025 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1399026 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1399027 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1399032 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1399033 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1399034 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1399035 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1399036 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1399037 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1399038 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1399039 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1399040 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1399041 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1399042 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1399043 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1399044 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1399045 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

1399067 the lost ring website is operated by the mcdonalds corporation
1399068 miley we should talk about the photos youve been taking lately
1399069 they should take a decision now even if the decision could affect the participation of the panamanian sportsmen in the olympic games
1399070 the situation went worse after the regional coordinator for latin america of the national olympic committees for the olympic games of beijing wang mengmeng sent a letter to the president of cop miguel sanchiz telling him about the concern due to the situation panama is going through
1399071 what worries me is that some delegates probably will arrive before this authorized person fernando samaniego and they could not valid their accreditation this is that can not enter the olympic villa
1399072 the thing about getting a much bigger house is the cost per square foot goes down because not many people want to take on a house that size
1399073 we took out part of the ceiling space and put in soundproofing to take out some of the noise
1399074 its no worse than living in a townhouse or duplex you hear footsteps and sometimes voices but because the building is solidly built its fine
1399075 its people wanting to adapt to a marketplace that has strained their resources so you get creative out of the box ideas floating around about how to enter in

1399077 the four of us have decided that when it comes time well give serious consideration to using geothermal heating that type of thing
1399078 we often see parents and children and friends who buy together
1399079 in doing so these people are able to build home equity faster by combining resources and sharing in the profits of higher priced real estate
1399080 for the price of a condo we each got a good sized space and we own the building and we own the land
1399081 the price per square foot for a house when we bought was around 200 says ms
1399082 and the price per square foot for a new condo was getting up to 400
1399083 you cant have your car in the driveway and all the things that guys want
1399084 there was also at the time the pressure of getting into the market and getting a piece of land
1399085 i grew up here and i have lots of friends 35 to 45 who will probably never own a place
1399086 they never had jobs to allow them to buy places when they were under 30 and now the market is out of their reach
1399087 it sounds stupid but its almost like the whole friends experience on tv where they are living in separate apartments but they are always walking in on each other all the time
1399088 religion is more important to them than their own life or peace for their mothers and so they set out to perform jihad
1399089 starting from last year east turkestan organizations have been persistently trying to launch activities targeting the olympic games
1399090 they want to use the simplest methods to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1399091 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uyghurs
1399092 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uyghurs
1399093 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uyghurs
1399094 seeing animals slaughtered to be worn as fashion is awful to me so im definitely against wearing fur id much rather go naked than ever put a dead animal on my body

1399106 i think it was a great success and i sure hope everybody had a good time
1399107 i think we hit every age group with the bands
1399108 if an individual is hell bent on getting a hold of or harming a victim i dont know that it would necessarily deter them
1399109 but it would give the victim enough time to call police hop in a car or lock doors
1399110 it doesnt mean you no longer have to worry about this
1399111 we certainly think this is another way to hold this person accountable
1399112 anything we can do to protect the victims and certainly to educate others to not become victims those are the steps that we need to take
1399113 our very important state tourism industry continues to grow even as the national economy is struggling

1399123 anyway as my band mates and i attempt to finish our most complete and radical album yet heres my why and what i think is right and wrong about boy having listened to it for the first time in over twenty years if you start from the pseudo british accent and the little reported fact that the singer sounds like a girl things dont look too promising the annoying gene is present in self consciousness and self immolation you do want to give the singer a slap for lots of reasons but lets start with the pretentiousness the singer has obviously been listening to siouxie and the banshees joy division and a few others whose combined archness and artfulness was just too much for the freckled face teenager from northside of dublin neither fully protestant or catholic ireland had left the boy with a face like a baked bean and in search of a nonregional identity a theme that continues to the present

1399144 it seems that bmw drew the port authoritys attention when it began pumping liquid hydrogen into its small test fleet of dual fuel sedans in port jersey not far from the docks where bmws disembark after their voyage from germany and historically speaking its fair to say that the last hydrogen dependent german flagship that docked in new jersey left a lasting impression so while bmw designed the hydrogen 7 to be as explosion resistant as any gasoline car memories of the hindenburg zeppelin cause misunderstandings among consumers and bureaucrats a company spokesman acknowledged as with hydrogen cars from ford general motors honda and others showcasing hydrogens carbon free potential is the bmws reason for being but unlike far costlier fuel cell cars which generate electricity through a chemical reaction of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen the bmw runs on either liquid hydrogen or gasoline in a familiar internal combustion engine

1399241 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time

1399244 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1399245 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1399246 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1399247 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1399248 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1399249 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies

1399259 wir waren bisher sehr kulant und haben nach r cksprache mit ihnen und ihrer zusage der scheck geht umgehend raus die lastschrift nicht platzen lassen das werden wir jetzt aber tun
1399260 dann tun sie das doch dann gebe ich jetzt der buha bescheid dass sie den scheck vernichtet

1399265 if the best defense is a good offense then i am more than willing to offend my enemies
1399266 we think that maybe god is fed up with our biblical based stance on homosexuals
1399267 but god has to realize we stand by his word even when he doesnt
1399268 were having a prayer breakfast for all the non homosexual men in the area first thing in the morning
1399269 we ask that all the women folk take some time to prepare a hearty breakfast for all the men folk with whatever they can find in the storms ruins and it better be good
1399270 regardless of which fairy tale you happen to believe in or worship well always be here with food clean water blankets and clothing for all those in the bible belt
1399271 someone has to take care of these people especially when their god doesnt seem to care one way or another

1399273 if i were going to live in florida or texas or anyplace else that gets hit with these types of natural disasters i myself may be more inclined to think someone or something was out to get me
1399274 but then again it still wouldnt make sense to think that way people have go to learn and last time i checked a public education was still free in this country
1399275 contrary to speculation earlier the scottish premier league fixtures this weekend will go ahead as planned
1399276 football engages motivates and inspires but we know it can spill over and get ugly we all have responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense now there is a dedication from all quarters including the media to do that
1399277 we want prevention rather than sanction and weve given credit to the media for playing a major part in the reduction of simulation
1399278 now we want to see this programme becoming much more than just a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1399279 captains must accept a new level of responsibility for the conduct of their teams and work closely with the referee
1399280 if some players go too far we can still recognise the benefits of a quiet word being applied but we also want referees to stand and deal with confrontation not back away some will have to change their mindsets
1399281 it has been difficult to keep referees who have had adverse experiences but we need to tell them they can apply the rules with full fa backing
1399282 we also need to ensure an enjoyable environment for youngsters playing the game they sometimes need to be protected from the influence of overly competitive adults who put too much store in success at that level and provide unnecessary tension
1399283 of course the game must be about competing and winning if possible but not to an over obsession
1399284 now we have a lot of people implementing this new scheme who are good at what they do and it gives me every confidence it will succeed
1399285 of course it is appraisal time at the start of any season fair enough because the game quite rightly has a growing social responsibility
1399286 players are seen as role models and im sure my members accept that some of the things that were seen last season were not too pretty
1399287 we certainly cant take for granted that our game will always automatically attract new supporters
1399288 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here
1399289 the manager has always said he will play them if they are good enough and he is true to his word he always has been in every way but the bar is extremely high and you have to be over it to get the opportunity
1399290 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1399291 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough
1399292 savvy consumers can actually make money while others rework budgets during hard times
1399293 the typical household that wisely uses coupons can save 25 percent on their annual grocery bill
1399294 marketers are faced with a golden opportunity to engage consumers desperately looking for ways to save money blanket distribution tactics waste money and offend consumers why send cat litter coupons to households that have no pets brands that take the extra step of analyzing the audience will be rewarded for sending offers relevant to the consumer

1399309 companies are increasingly going to be held accountable not only for the quality and price of their products and services but also for the corporate citizenship and environmental stewardship of their business as a whole as these are key components of a companys reputation
1399310 while consumers are rarely willing to reward good corporate citizens by paying a premium for their products and services companies that practice social responsibility and good corporate citizenship clearly offer a positive point of differentiation in an increasingly fragmented market

1399389 most likely these universities grew as a tree grows from a seed blown by chance of the wind it seems easy enough to understand why paris that great city should have possessed a great university yet i surmise the processes at oxford and cambridge to have been only a little less fortuitous the schools of remigius and of william of champeaux we will say have given paris a certain prestige when abelard a pupil of williams springs into fame and draws a horde of students from all over europe to sit at his feet these nations of young men have to be organised brought under some sort of discipline if only to make the citizens lives endurable and lo the thing is done in like manner irnerius at bologna vacarius at oxford and at cambridge some innominate teacher of importance as browning would put it in his day possibly set the ball rolling or again it is suggested that a body of scholars dissatisfied with oxford such dissatisfaction has been known even in historical times migrated hither
1399390 although tom was often in the company of communists on and off campus he was avowedly no sympathizer it was not so much the goals of communism that soured him as it was the grim and rabid fellow travelers innominate in their appropriately named cells that he found repugnant he simply had no wish to join the masses he felt he was suffering anonymity enough in his own one room cell at home

1399393 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1399394 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1399395 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1399396 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1399397 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1399398 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1399399 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1399400 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1399401 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1399402 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1399403 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1399404 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1399405 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1399406 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1399407 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1399408 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1399409 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1399410 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1399411 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1399412 a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of this country
1399413 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1399414 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1399415 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1399416 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1399417 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1399418 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1399419 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1399420 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1399421 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1399422 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1399423 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1399424 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1399425 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1399426 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1399427 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1399428 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1399429 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
1399430 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
1399431 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
1399432 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1399433 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1399434 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1399435 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1399436 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together

1399441 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1399442 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1399443 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1399444 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1399445 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1399446 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1399447 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1399448 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1399449 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1399450 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1399451 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1399452 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1399453 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives

1399461 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1399462 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1399463 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1399464 we were not as clear as we might have been
1399465 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1399466 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1399467 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1399468 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1399469 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1399470 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1399471 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1399472 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1399473 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1399474 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1399475 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1399476 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1399477 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1399478 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1399479 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1399480 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1399481 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1399482 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1399483 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1399484 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1399485 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1399486 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1399487 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1399488 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1399489 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1399490 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1399491 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1399492 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1399493 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1399494 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1399495 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1399496 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1399497 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1399498 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1399499 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1399500 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1399501 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1399502 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1399503 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1399504 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1399505 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1399506 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1399507 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1399508 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1399509 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1399510 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1399511 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
1399512 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
1399513 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
1399514 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
1399515 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
1399516 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
1399517 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
1399518 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
1399519 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
1399520 i deeply regret that i displayed offensive items on my facebook page
1399521 these materials have been removed i apologize to everyone who was offended and humbly ask for your forgiveness
1399522 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1399523 when john mccain gets up there and says id rather win an election than win a war when he says i didnt visit the troops when i was overseas even though every media outlet says thats just not true it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1399524 should think about maintaining military advantage in the 21st century
1399525 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1399526 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1399527 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1399528 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1399529 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1399530 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1399531 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1399532 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1399533 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1399534 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1399535 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1399536 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1399537 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1399538 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1399539 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1399540 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1399541 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1399542 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1399543 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1399544 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1399545 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1399546 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1399547 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1399548 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1399549 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1399550 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1399551 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1399552 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1399553 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1399554 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1399555 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1399556 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1399557 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1399558 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1399559 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1399560 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1399561 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1399562 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1399563 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1399564 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1399565 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1399566 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1399567 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1399568 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1399569 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1399570 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1399571 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1399572 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1399573 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1399574 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1399575 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1399576 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1399577 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1399578 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1399579 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1399580 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1399581 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1399582 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1399583 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1399584 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1399585 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1399586 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1399587 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1399588 every car on the road in the u s powered by hydrogen produced from clean sources of energy by the end of 2020
1399589 commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1399590 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1399591 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1399592 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1399593 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1399594 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1399595 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1399596 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1399597 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1399598 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1399599 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1399600 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1399601 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1399602 dizzywoods tree planting is a great example of how an adventurous storyline can cleverly weave a strong educational component into play
1399603 it is an opportunity to allow kids to see the wider impact that they can have by working together as well as what it means to be a citizen of the world in that case a virtual one we hope the kids are as inspired to see their online environmental activity have real world results as we are
1399604 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1399605 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1399606 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1399607 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1399608 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1399609 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1399610 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1399611 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1399612 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1399613 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1399614 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1399615 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1399616 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty

1399623 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1399624 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1399625 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1399626 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1399627 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1399628 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1399629 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1399630 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1399631 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1399632 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1399633 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1399634 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1399635 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1399636 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

1399692 slimy foul poisonous designed to exploit the hostility anxiety and resentment of the many white americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women
1399693 the navy has been delivering a lunch bag of bullshit to congress regarding surface combatants for three years
1399694 the navy has not only kept the arsenal ship concept alive and well but they evolved the program from six small dependent combatants into a class of seven independent stealth battleships then had the program funded and pushed through congress in plain sight under the pretext of a more capable program
1399695 we are the light of the world we are the leaders of the free world but when we depend on foreign energy we cannot be as strong of a leader as we should and can be
1399696 you need to let your congressman know that he or she works for you not the speaker of the house

1399699 the only way were ever going to bring her to heel and allow a vote is for us to continue to put pressure on her and so its 25 members we had in congress today led by tom price and mike pence its members all over the country doing their townhall meetings doing their rotary clubs theyre all talking about it and were going to keep talking about it until we get our vote
1399700 heres the truth right now progressives are losing this argument
1399701 doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
1399702 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1399703 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of

1399729 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
1399730 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
1399731 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
1399732 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
1399733 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
1399734 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1399735 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly

1399738 the regime shift to younger and thinner ice could soon result in an ice free north pole during summer
1399739 reduced ice thickness in arctic transpolar drift favours rapid ice retreat
1399740 clearly the thinner ice cover favours a stronger areal retreat of the ice during summer
1399741 points to the possibility of further rapid reductions once that vast uniform region has thinned further below certain thresholds
1399742 the arctic sea ice cover has transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice free summers would soon become normal
1399743 nevertheless it is perhaps too soon to make a definitive pronouncement concerning this years probable extent at the summer minimum
1399744 the arctic sea ice is in a condition we have not seen since satellites began taking measurements thin ice is much more vulnerable to melting completely during the summer it seems likely that we will see a faster than normal rate of decline through the rest of the summer

1399765 where borrowers with loan balances higher than their original loan amount are located in neighborhoods that are still appreciating they have the ltv needed to refinance
1399766 certainly this is a small group however this is the level of micro targeting that lenders need to be engaged in while under these market conditions
1399767 we anticipate that ltvs will continue to increase further tightening underwriting criteria

1399813 das ph nomen der produktf lschung ist an sich keinesfalls neu es l sst sich allerdings feststellen dass sich das problem in den vergangenen paar jahren auf eine zunehmende zahl der unterschiedlichsten industriebereiche ausgeweitet hat
1399814 diese beobachtung hat uns vor mittlerweile rund zwei jahren dazu veranlasst das aktuelle projekt zu starten
1399815 in der ausrichtung wendet sich das portal aber an ein wesentlich breiteres publikum
1399816 mit dem portal wollen wir aber auch zus tzlich zu den rechtlichen ma nahmen eine hilfestellung bieten

1399823 das war das zugest ndnis des ioc an die rechteinhaber in den usa diese bezahlen viel geld f r die bertragungsrechte und wollen sportarten mit hoher medaillenchance auch zur prime time senden
1399824 das ist eine rechtefrage die bertragungsrechte und damit auch die f r das internet wurden l nderweise vergeben

1399865 yeah i dont have health insurance so i cant really go see a doctor
1399866 so do you think since you have health insurance you can go to your doctor and find out what you have and let me know
1399867 oh yeah i ended up going to this clinic thing that was free and found out what it was its just folliculitis its an infection of the hair follicles down there

1399877 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
1399878 it is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions especially selfish ones
1399879 i am of course confident that i will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death but may it be that repeated lessons will finally teach us not to stop the writers pen during his lifetime at no time has this ennobled our history

1399979 all this just ahead but our lead story this hour brett favre has lunch weve got jim standing by in green bay with more
1399980 thats right ken it was apparently some kind of sandwich along with what were told were a few potato chips deanna favre was with him and we understand that she had a sandwich of her own ken
1399981 sorry ken theres a lot of commotion out here as you might expect i meant the sandwiches that both brett and deanna had one sandwich apiece
1399982 thanks for clearing that up jim and can you tell us chips for deanna too
1399983 but weve still got some people working on it and as soon as we know youll hear all about it
1399984 im sure we will meanwhile youve got a lot of fans here on the packerland network sitting on pins and needles any word at all on the fillings
1399985 the fillings for the sandwiches do you know if it was a peanut butter and jelly kind of thing or more like a roast beef or chicken kind of thing
1399986 no word on that ken bretts been known to enjoy a variety of sandwich types as you know so until we get more information right now your guess is as good as mine
1399987 and back to the chips again for a moment jim i know youve reported he had a few potato chips with the sandwich can you narrow that down for us at all
1399988 what were hearing ken and this is unconfirmed is that brett had somewhere between seven and nine chips
1399989 thats right between seven and nine chips for him and an unknown number for deanna
1399990 well shes a lot smaller than brett is of course so youd certainly have to figure thats right maybe in the range of four to six chips for deanna but at this point were really just speculating
1399991 and no dessert were being told on pretty good authority that brett did not have any dessert with his lunch
1399992 well thats interesting people are going to read all sorts of things into that arent they
1399993 very likely ken very likely i think it says something about how serious he is about coming back trying to avoid those extra calories
1399994 although he had been working out pretty regularly down in mississippi
1399995 not at all ken of course as we all know theres a difference between being in shape and being in nfl shape
1399996 but at this stage were just kind of reading the tea leaves here we dont know if he was trying to slim down or if he simply didnt feel like having anything else
