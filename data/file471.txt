4710007 while it is early days to say what the security situation is going to look like in georgia longer term the events of the past few days deal a blow to the u s s plans to support existing and new oil and gas routes that bypass russia
4710008 what happened in georgia has come on the back of other events in russia that have increased market concerns
4710009 together these are increasing the risk perception around the russian market
4710010 take all the money you want to lose to russia and you wont be disappointed
4710011 i dont think direct investors will be so easily deterred and they will still be seeking opportunities across all different sectors of the russian economy including energy
4710012 intended to reorganize the russian oil and gas industry to enhance the power of the russian state
4710013 only then after the reorganization was complete and the states capacity to protect the national interests in this strategic sector was reaffirmed would western firms be invited to participate in the russian market
4710014 russia knows they are providing huge amounts to natural gas to europe that they have a stranglehold on europe
4710015 there is no question in my mind that russia is going to play its energy card as much as it can
4710016 there are certainly very strong parallels between the development of russias domestic policy and its projection of influence over the other former soviet countries
4710017 russia has always felt it would like to exert a high degree of control over the development of the oil and gas industries of both central asia and the caucasus as well as its own
4710018 russias energy objective is to monopolize all caspian energy flows to europe so that it can then blackmail europe and force political changes to european policy
4710019 what is really at stake is the unrestricted access of caspian oil to world markets
4710020 if as a byproduct of the conflict in georgia people become more wary in the future of expanding the capacity of the export corridor through georgia then there will be no tears shed in moscow

4710038 to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4710039 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4710040 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4710041 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4710042 us and serbia are a bit better than the usa
4710043 they probably will be the third team in our group
4710044 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday

4710102 ich freue mich immer sehr wenn eine neue rennstrecke im kalender auftaucht und auf valencia bin ich besonders gespannt
4710103 es wird ein echter stadtkurs im sinne von innenstadt also anders als die kurse von melbourne oder montr al in sachen charme und anspruch k nnte das rennen in valencia dem gro en preis von monaco am n chsten kommen
4710104 valencia gef llt mir sehr gut ich war ja auch schon sehr h ufig dort wir testen viel auf der permanenten rennstrecke in cheste und haben in valencia auch schon mehrfach unser neues formel 1 auto pr sentiert die ersten meter mit einem brandneuen auto sind immer ganz besondere erlebnisse anfang 2008 habe ich zwischen dem roll out und dem n chsten test ein paar tage urlaub mit meiner familie in valencia verbracht
4710105 wir hatten eine gute zeit wir waren am strand und in der stadt gibt es ein ausgetrocknetes flussbett in dem parkanlagen und spielpl tze sind das war sehr sch n speziell nat rlich f r die kinder zum shoppen und essen gehen ist valencia nat rlich auch ein tipp mir gef llt auch der kontrast zwischen historischen und futuristischen bauten
4710106 ich freue mich sehr auf das rennen in valencia ich bin generell ein gro er fan von stadtkursen sie sind sehr anspruchsvoll weil sie oft wellig sind und wechselnden stra enbelag aufweisen wenn man einen fehler macht landet man schnell an der leitplanke
4710107 valencia wird nicht komplett stadtkurscharakter haben es gibt aus sicherheitsgr nden viele auslaufzonen die fia unternimmt diesbez glich gro e anstrengungen und das ist gut auf einem stra enkurs ist es von gro er wichtigkeit eine gute basisabstimmung zu haben mit der das auto leicht fahrbar ist
4710108 die verbesserung der rundenzeiten muss schritt f r schritt erarbeitet werden man kann da nicht zu wild herangehen auch der ideallinie muss man sich schrittweise ann hern
4710109 es ist sehr wichtig die strecke abzugehen ehe man das erste mal f hrt um ein gef hl f r die oberfl che und den verlauf zu bekommen

4710140 in terms of profitability i would say 2008 is a significant turn in the industry
4710141 in 2008 i think were going to see a real plateau
4710142 this is the first year i have seen widespread concern about profitability
4710143 the bare root ball and burlap and container sectors this year are all experiencing real challenges
4710144 there are changes in the marketplace because of a growing interest in buying less and buying more often
4710145 people dont want to manage and care for a lot of stock and assume the risk that they may end up sitting on it that creates a challenge for our industry because as people go toward that mode of ordering it makes the transportation process less efficient
4710146 people are saying if were not going to fly somewhere then by god this is the year im going to do something around the yard
4710147 one way to distinguish your home and give your home curb appeal is to spruce up your outdoors

4710151 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4710152 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4710153 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4710154 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4710155 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4710156 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4710157 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4710158 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4710159 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4710160 there are so many areas where people can hide here we cleared anderson in 20 minutes it would take hours to search this property
4710161 in the 1970s when we first opened the store it was cheap furniture
4710162 it was all pine youd take it home and take it out of the box and assemble it
4710163 the advantage is that it lasts forever when we had the hurricane people came in and said that everything in the house that was made with particle board was ruined everything that was solid wood they took it outside cloroxed it and finished it

4710167 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009

4710169 in rural areas were seeing people in similar conditions to those patients in the mid 1990s
4710170 were seeing cases of pneumocystis that just doesnt happen anymore
4710171 in rural areas people neglect getting care because theyre afraid of what the neighbors might say
4710172 theres a strong stigma in these areas about the disease that prevents people from getting treatment
4710173 were not looking at a type of person who gets hiv were looking at behavior that causes transmission if we can change the focus to behavior we can curtail the stigmas
4710174 our needs are growing but the funding isnt keeping up with our needs
4710175 high risk sexual behavior makes transmission more probable we have to be able to talk about sexuality in order for prevention to work
4710176 we have to be able to provide descriptions and go into depth about high risk activity
4710177 otherwise were not giving people the right tools to protect themselves
4710178 theres been a shift in the gay communitys attitude about the disease
4710179 its now seen as treatable and the urgency is gone
4710180 the good news is that at this time theyre not planning on doing that shutting down production

4710184 was recognised by sadc itself as not free and fair and not reflective of the democratic will
4710185 mugabe should not be recognised as a head of state
4710186 sadc has repeatedly said it will not recognise unconstitutional changes in government and we intend holding them to this commitment
4710187 his country will sign a cease fire accord with georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements including a troop withdrawal

4710190 peace needs to re established in the region and guaranteed and underpinned so that no one again will get idiotic ideas and this i see as the main task of the russian federation

4710192 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4710193 i have urged the immigration bureau to investigate the legitimacy of the employment of the foreigners including even koreans and find out whether they have the necessary working permits i dont know why foreigners have to be hired there since i am sure we are not short of qualified filipino workers who can take their place

4710196 sen mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back we cant afford to take that chance we cant afford to keep running up record deficits while we favor the few over the many we cant prioritize a misguided war in iraq over the urgent needs of the american people
4710197 i tried to be very concentrated on the game not to be more emotionally involved
4710198 ive been coaching with the u s team for the last four years this is not the first time weve played against china
4710199 every point for our team is very important dont think about the result even if we lose the game every point is important we have to fight for the result

4710247 they built the high places of baal that are in the valley of ben hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to molech which i had not commanded them nor had it entered my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin
4710248 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven will enter
4710249 will give to each person according to what he has done
4710250 if obamas support for the slaughter of babies does not disqualify him for heaven then everyone must be going to heaven
4710251 so as through one offense there resulted condemnation to all men so also through one righteous deed there resulted justification of life to all men
4710252 as you judge others so you will be judged the measure of mercy you give is the measure you will receive
4710253 obamas theology is not grounded in the bible i dont know where he gets all of his beliefs from but i do know that many of obamas beliefs that i know about actually contradict scripture rather than agreeing with it that is good reason to doubt obamas claim of belief so based on the evidence that i have seen from obama i dont believe that obama is a real christian

4710282 daar wonen veel gelovigen en dus relatief veel mensen die hun geloof willen uitdragen maar zij hebben niet allemaal zin om naar oost groningen te verhuizen waar gemeentestichting misschien meer nut zou hebben daar komt bij dat je op de veluwe makkelijker medestanders vindt die met hun eigen kerk niet zo gelukkig zijn en makkelijk iets nieuws beginnen

4710289 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous

4710298 het is een reactie op de kwaliteit van het huidige onderwijs
4710299 een gangmaker in de klas geen adhder maar wel druk
4710300 we werden aangesproken door iemand van school daar schrokken we van lodewijk was achteruitgegaan bij zijn toetsen wij wilden weten hoe dat kwam en wat we konden doen maar daar kwam geen antwoord op
4710301 er is vier tot zes uur extra les per week en extra aandacht voor hoogbegaafdheid dyslexie en dyscalculi
4710302 op florencius hebben we remedial teachers en een psycholoog en we stellen hogere eisen dan de overheid
4710303 het was en is een goede school de omnibus met bevlogen leerkrachten en goede rapporten van de inspectie
4710304 maar het is voor een reguliere school onmogelijk om alle kinderen zorg op maat te bieden reguliere basisscholen in nederland kampen vaak met grote problemen
4710305 altijd te weinig geld voor een cht mooi schoon gebouw grote klassen vieze wcs en onderwijs voor de middenmoot omdat er niet genoeg individuele begeleiding is rekenen en taal wordt er niet meer goed aangeleerd
4710306 er is geen maatwerk er is weinig aandacht voor andere manieren van leren creatieve vakken sport er zijn beperkte middelen slechts twee computers per klas de kwaliteit van het onderwijzend personeel is onvoldoende
4710307 kinderen weten tegenwoordig niks ze kunnen niks dat weet iedereen
4710308 maar het ministerie zegt dat er niets aan hand is het onderwijs is te modern geworden de nadruk op kennis is verschoven naar babbelen kinderen praten over de ozonlaag terwijl ze niet weten wat ozon is
4710309 een reactie op de alom aanwezige onvrede over het publieke onderwijs
4710310 in de vs leidt het tot een enorme groei van het thuisonderwijs dat gaat daar al om 1 5 miljoen kinderen
4710311 want dyslexie om maar iets te noemen is iets anders dan hoogbegaafdheid en dat vergt dus een ander soort zorg
4710312 de pluriformiteit van het onderwijs die is er helemaal niet een beetje liberalisering zou best wenselijk zijn
4710313 daar werken we nu hard aan maar het is absoluut niet zo dat dit soort scholen nodig is omdat er niet meer genoeg goede scholen in nederland zouden zijn integendeel driekwart van de scholen in nederland is gewoon goed zeker in bussum waar het initiatief start
4710314 juist op de basisschoolleeftijd is het belangrijk dat leerlingen ervaringen opdoen met kinderen uit allerlei groeperingen uit de samenleving
4710315 ik wil met dit initiatief ook een signaal geven aan de overheid dat het onderwijs anders kan
4710316 als je een reguliere school wilt starten moet je in het aanbod van de gemeente passen
4710317 daarnaast heb je een minimum aantal kinderen nodig om een school te stichten en dan wordt zon school en de klassen dus weer te groot die bureaucratische weg wilde ik niet nog een keer bewandelen
4710318 het is eigenlijk een variant op politieke stromingen als de pvda niet links genoeg is zal de sp groeien
4710319 the olympic venues and facilities could be a showcase of a countrys own culture and hosting nations should devote to spreading the olympic spirit

4710321 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4710322 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4710323 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4710324 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4710325 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4710326 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4710327 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4710346 ive said this before many times its really dangerous to be the it girl the year before the olympics on the one hand you have the enormous publicity and the endorsement money the other side of the sword are the expectations and pressure

4710348 but in most cases if you go against the athletic types the athletic types win mary lou retton carly patterson those types beat out longer lankier athletes who cant stick the landings like mighty mites history shows the shawn johnson type athlete usually wins because the scoring system rewards the athlete

4710519 now weve had pastors and teachers for a long time evangelists have been around for a long time but prophets and apostles are relatively newcomers on the scene and prophets began to arise and be accepted widely in the body of christ in the 1980s and apostles began to arise and be accepted in the body of christ in the 1990s
4710520 the whole movement based on prophets and apostles that has now emerged as a new wineskin that god is giving to the body of christ is called the new apostolic reformation thats what were in right now
4710521 folks we here sitting in this room are members of the first generation in the history of christianity that has the realistic potential of completing the great commission so the government is in place
4710522 the new apostolic reformation is the most radical change in the way of doing church since the protestant reformation
4710523 how did i get the idea that i was a apostle as far back as i can find back in the prophetic journal the first prophecy i ever had that used the word apostle came from
4710524 all of a sudden the platform got full with a lot of prophets and intercessors next thing i know im on my knees and charles doolittle has that sword over my head
4710525 even from this day forward even from this national conference there shall be a release on your spirit whether you want to say apostle or not is of no effect
4710526 now he who establishes us with you in christ and has anointed us is god
4710527 for even if i should boast somewhat more about our the apostles authority which the lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction i shall not be ashamed
4710528 therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the authority which the lord has given me for edification and not for destruction
4710529 paul an apostle not from men or through man but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
4710530 if you are a believer there has never been a better time for you to make history
4710531 in the second apostolic age we are already living through the most radical change in our way of doing church since the protestant reformation
4710532 he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches
4710533 now the spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons
4710534 no one having drunk old wine immediately desires new for he says the old is better
4710535 god has his hand on america to bring our nation back into its proper alignment a major key to making this happen is the formation of the u s apostolic alliance few have the clear practical vision and the passion for mobilizing our nations apostolic and prophetic leaders region by region than apostle dutch sheets i am excited to be a part of dutchs apostolic team and i believe we are going to witness giant steps toward seeing our land reflect the kingdom of god in very near future

4710545 its okay id much rather never see him again anyway
4710546 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4710547 i do think its difficult to compare different sports but in terms of just sheer dominance in his events and the times hes putting up and what hes doing now in two olympics i think its hard to argue
4710548 being compared to the greatest olympian of all time thats not bad
4710549 but i want to do something that no one else has ever done before i want people to look at me as being one of a kind
4710550 he is the single greatest olympic athlete of all time now
4710551 he will be probably the single greatest athlete compared to anybody in any century the 20th the 21st century whatever
4710552 you know you judge a persons character by the company you keep and im glad im keeping company with michael phelps ill be happy to stand aside and let him carry the torch hes just one great athlete and its very exciting to watch him
4710553 mark was a very talented swimmer and very dominant in his time
4710554 i think that the difference with michael is that he has a much more challenging program and i think that the competition throughout the world is more challenging
4710555 its apples and oranges its a different ballgame technology has changed their personalities are different im not saying anything negative about spitz but his time is gone its time to turn the reins over to somebody else
4710556 michael is the best in the world in three different strokes
4710557 its totally unusual for anyone to have a talent like that in those three different strokes michael jordan was talented in basketball but he couldnt hit the baseball could he
4710558 when i do lose like that it just motivates me to swim faster

4710562 the bigfoot press conference was nothing more than chinese democracy
4710563 yes we need to make clear about it it is necessary for us to hold on the ultimate guideline as we talk any subject related to personal development
4710564 we have a boundary for our personal growth and have accepted the ultimate guideline as our reference now it is important to know who we are before we make further steps on personal development we need to know our selves before we know other things
4710565 yes but in order to know our selves we must first know god so it is true that the first we need to know is god then we know ourselves but we are not going to discuss this now we will discuss this sacred subject at another conversation on christian religion but we will emphasize our conversation on personal development
4710566 if we read the holy bible it is clear who we are we will stress three important principles about us the first principle is that we are created by god it means he is the only person that knows everything about us there is a history how we were created in the past in brief we are made from dust
4710567 you mean we are made from dust it seems we are not made from important material like gold or silver
4710568 yes we are made from insignificant material god created man and before the first man became a living being god gave breath after that the first man became a living being called man we could read the line of generation of men on the bible if we are able to make a line we are the descendents of adam we are not descended from animal as some people said no our ancestor is adam
4710569 so all of us will have the same ancestor adam
4710570 yes some tribes still use this to identify themselves for example batak tribe people in indonesia could draw the line of their ancestor up to 25 generation or more chinese may have more than that jews has probably more jews could take their line of ancestor to abraham and even to adam i think they are the only nation that has a clear line of ancestry
4710571 the second principle is that we are crated as the image of god we are created as his likeness we are like god god is spirit so we are spritual being god creates and we are given the ability to create but the thing we create is made fom existing material god create something from nothing that is the differene if we make a car for example the material fro car has existed before if we want to make a new building the material for that has existed before
4710572 god thinks so we could also think we are supposed to think like god think to act like god acts to feel like god feels so because we are created by god we should be like him in thinking acting and feeling
4710573 will it be possible that we could think like god thinks act like god acts and feel like god feels
4710574 this does not mean that because we have hands or feet or ears or mouth god has the same thing god does not have physical element but god has ability to speak walk hear feel and see god is spiritual bein we are also spiritual being we are the only creation that has spirit and we could communicate with god animal may have spirit but they are not able to communicate with god as we do we could think speak and feel animal may have emotion but to express emotion as we do is not owned by animal we could dream we could laugh we could imagine we could create but as the derivative of gods creation this kind of character is not owned by animal it is not given to animal so we are special we are so precious in the face of god
4710575 augustine made a shorter list he wanted to god and himself only our personal development should be viewed on this aspect this will make our personal development has a meaning
4710576 our conversation on the last meeting was so inspiring to me i have never been aware that i only need to know god and my self i just wonder how augustine came to that conclusion
4710577 he is a very special person in history we do not know what would happen to the history of the civilization if he were not born he lived around 340 409 ad he wrote a lot of books and papers and his books and papers have been the main source of the great reformators such as marthin luther and john calvin
4710578 so he is an important person in the history of civilization isnt he
4710579 yes he is also a rare person his statement about knowing was so inspiring for him he just needed to know god and himself it means we do not need to know anything except godf and ourselves
4710580 actually we can not separate those two subjects to truly know god may not be very apparent to people the only evidence that someone knows god is through his actions how he respond to other people what he thinks what he talks and what decisions he makes through such actions we may be able to know whether he knows god or not
4710581 it seems so simple how to identify whether we know god or not
4710582 if we say we know god but we dont do what god says it is not true so the proof that we know god is our thought speeches and actions how we dealt with issues we faces espresses our knowledge of god that is a clear evidence that we know god it is not true to say we know god but we do not show it in our thought speech and action we can not say we know god if we do not worship him we do not honor parent we hate people we mess around with other woman we steal other peoples belonging we lie and we want others people belonging there is a close relationship between our relationship to god and our relationship with man
4710583 so knowing god is the basis for our relationship with man
4710584 so if we want to grow personally our relationship with god must be first evaluated that is the start of our personal growth our relationship with god will dictate our personal development those who really have a good relationship with god will have a better chance to have a good personal development his true growth depends on his personal relationship with god
4710585 it is true i think people on the modern age ignore that we keep thinking that we grow but we ignore the basic one there is no true growth without having good relationship with god it is true that people may still grow but at the end his growth will sum up to zero
4710586 that is the trend of the modern age if we read all personal growth or evaluate any classes that teach about personal growth the religious aspect is eliminated it is so secular we want to grow without god it is impossible we may achieve personal growth to certain level but on the hand of god such growth has no values
4710587 that causes to think what we need to learn to grow on our previous conversation we have discussed that the final result of our personal development is to make right decision but the basis for making right decision is the ultimate guideline which is the holy bible so all the principles that we need to understand and apply on our life is available on the holy book all principles that god wants us to know are available so that when we make decision for our life we make them within the boundary of his commands
4710588 you mean that all principles for our practical decisions are written down on the bible
4710589 yes that will be the main source of our learning material for our personal growth there is a saying the in the holy book the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom just that statement has laid down the most fundamental principle for personal development wisdom is what actually we want on decision making process so if any one needs wisdom the requirement is fear the lord
4710590 it is simple but in the reality it takes a lot of consequences
4710591 in 2002 there was a re organization in a company i worked for this was due to acquisition process two big oil companies in the world merged into one company as we know when two companies merge the number of jobs available is less than the number of people as a result some people could loose their jobs two people even more will compete to fill a position available
4710592 was there any selection process done by the top management
4710593 through e mail it was communicated to all employees that qualification would be considered i did not now how actually the selection process was made but the result of selection process was announced and the new organization structure was communicated to employees the first announcement is of vice presidents level after several days the managers level then the supervisors level then the staffs level what do you think about that
4710594 many organizations applied similar approach we design organization structure and select people to fill available positions in many institutions they tend to make as many sections or departments as possible without considering how the relationship between one department to another is we tend to make a big organization structure without considering its effectiveness and efficiency we even try to make a kingdom within organization
4710595 that is the common practice in our country isnt it
4710596 the logic is simple when we establish an organization whatever the type of organization is there must be a reason there must be a purpose there must be something to achieve so we need to focus on that purpose in other word we need to focus on the final product of the organization
4710597 often we miss that point and even forget what our product is
4710598 that what happen in general we forget what we want to achieve we do not focus on what we want to accomplish we do not pay attention to the product to be delivered to the stakeholder or customer
4710599 lets say we know what to be accomplished what is next then
4710600 the next to consider is how we are going to achieve it in other words if we want to deliver a product to the customer what its business process is
4710601 so once we decide the product to be delivered material or services we need to identify how we are going to produce that product dont we
4710602 yes once the product is made clear the design quality quantity etc then we need to think how we are going to produce it what activities material fund time and people are needed to make the product when we have all this information then we design our organization structure such so that we can deliver the product effectively and efficiently
4710603 the concept looks simple define the product first then make its business process then design the organization structure we need
4710604 sure it is simple and workable that will make our organization be productive effective and efficient
4710605 what is my product in the organization what do i contribute to what does the organization get from me as the return of my monthly salary who uses my product
4710606 what is the quality of my product how much time do i spend to make that product how much cost do i spend to make that product
4710607 we rare ask these question to our selves when we work for an organization if there are they are rare people
4710608 if we know how many hours we spend to make a product we could calculate its cost by multiplying the number of hours to our rate per hour the rate per hour could be estimated by dividing our monthly salary with total hours per month
4710609 we need considering and answering all the above questions as we work for any organization from top management to office boy each should ask these questions because at the end the total of our products will be consolidated into products of our organization again the same questions that we apply to our product will be the same as that of products of our organization if many people on organization ask those questions and answer them positively the organization will be healthy
4710610 the fact is that many people do not consider and answer those questions the worst thing is that we do not care the only thing that we care most is payroll slip
4710611 if we answer these questions we will be amazed how effective and efficient we produce a product if most people on organization ask and answer the same questions how efficient the organization will be how effective the industry will be how effective and efficient our country will be
4710612 but how many people in the organization think like that
4710613 that is something that makes me worried if not many of us ask and answer those questions what our organization industry and country will be
4710614 at least those who have the greatest impact will think about it
4710615 but will our subordinates think the same will they care about the product do they care about how much time is invested do we appreciate the resources how much do we appreciate the time if most people on our organization that organization is healthy because if we care our product we should also care the people time and resources to make it
4710616 we could expand the questions for example what the impact of our product to the customer is does it make the society better or does it make the environment worse or better again the questions the importance of our product will be at stake do we produce something that is not useful or is our product just waste of time o resources we could make a small test on your organization what is the product or output of employees on who use it how much time did they spend on making that product what is the value of that product

4710626 tucumcaris ongoing problem is that were a handout town when we need to fix a street we go to santa fe
4710627 our goal should be to do our own funding and debt service so if a road lasts 20 years we can plan to replace it without having to go to santa fe

4710637 despu s de ver el v deo nos reunimos con los serbios para darles una explicaci n y ofrecerles a ellos el v deo porque no hab an tenido la oportunidad debido a que antes las reglas no se lo permiten

4710640 el sistema de cronometraje siempre es probado antes de la competici n antes de usarlo siempre lo probamos si no est s de acuerdo con los rbitros puedes apelar al jurado pero ellos los serbios la aceptaron no es el ojo del hombre el que decide qui n gana sino el sistema de cronometraje
4710641 el primer paso es hacer una protesta a los rbitros en 30 minutos y el arbitro contesta el siguiente es apelar que es el ultimo y ellos decidieron no apelar y aceptar la decisi n de los rbitros
4710642 el sistema de crono funciona en dos diferentes maneras uno por el cable y otro por bater a y son independientes
4710643 the government will not care about agriculture unless the citizens demand it make sure that the people you vote for have a agriculture platform politicians are much like shopping at safeway or save on they are competing for your voting dollar it is no different with politicians
4710644 ive read the freeplaymusic com rate card and i was wondering whether my interpretation of the stipulations you have presented is correct does it mean that if i use an indie music in one of my video blogs for as long as it is under 4 minutes per episode and i attribute the artist and free play music accordingly i am then not required to pay the minimum rate i think i usedfreeplaymusic com downloaded mp3s in about 2 of my previous under 4 minute video blogs and that i made the proper attributions as a responsible blogger but i nevertheless felt the need to email you to clarify if indeed my interpretation holds true i shall gladly take alleged videos down and replace them with royalty free music elsewhere if i am indeed to be charged heh im cheap like that chuckles and besides i dont earn a single cent from blogging passion is what drives me to maintain the ad free site

4710654 they are actually dealing with the grief and loss of something in their lives the right way they are actually on the road to healing
4710655 youd have to be crazy to put yourself through all of this if you werent called of god
4710656 how do you cope with such a multitude of losses all at once
4710657 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
4710658 the lord confides in those who fear him he makes his covenant known to them
4710659 surely aslan is not leading you in that direction we can all plainly see that that is not the right way to go
4710660 are you so foolish after beginning with the spirit are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort
4710661 not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord almighty
4710662 you came at just the right time weve never had this much power before

4710669 spring 2009 sees new collections from all the major houses many re using similar ideas or components that hasnt hurt their industry rather it helps to build awareness amongst the potential audience
4710670 its upgrade time maybe ill change distros as well while there are new releases around
4710671 would that make a major difference for you im willing to bet not that from a customer view folks who prefer x will still prefer x a person who prefers red hat will stick with red hat
4710672 if open source companys start to duplicate efforts just to have an competitive edge over other open source companys then i am worried
4710673 there can be more bugs and flaws in an lts release and that is no problem
4710674 instead of creating certainty and trust for end users businesses and coders as synchronized releases do picking an lts release at the end of the year creates uncertainty and this is not good of course
4710675 also the chances are very high the first release that year will be the most stable at the end of the year simply because it already saw more patches over the year
4710676 not telling developers that theyre working on an lts means that they have to approach every release as a lts
4710677 i just hope the next lts comes out with a kernel thats had more than what seemed like 12 hours in beta that way i for my risk averse applications would have a clear idea of what issues would exist and deserve workarounds

4710684 yes the bug is that bad everyone should be paying attention to this one fortunately most of the big sites out there have been patched for now but the current patch only buys us some time it doesnt actually fix the real problem
4710685 global issues like poverty are extremely complex there is no simple clear answer by asking thousands of different people to give their viewpoints and opinions blog action day creates an extraordinary lens through which to view these issues each blogger brings their own perspective and ideas each blogger posts relating to their own blog topic and each blogger engages their audience differently

4710692 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
4710693 the lack of clarity about georgias prospects of joining nato contributed to the present crisis it encouraged russia to believe it could intimidate and bully because the west was divided and uncertain the knowledge that nato membership was a real prospect would have provided allies with greater leverage over the actions of tbilisis government and a greater incentive for russia to put a real effort into resolving some of the frozen conflicts around its borders

4710695 mamma mia here i go again my my how can i resist you
4710696 mr obama admit to us right now if ever you will win will you be planning to enslave the white race
4710697 the left hand trait is really impressive for how fluid secure and precise it is
4710698 despite all the perplexity that it may cause also regarding the lack of information on its provenance the work is at least for now the most important find since the identification of the lady with an ermine
4710699 there were only very few artists of that calibre then
4710700 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4710701 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4710702 among my favourite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4710703 weve only put them in a couple of homes so far but since we put them in their model home thereve been a lot of people asking for them when they price their homes the motion sensor faucets we havent put any in a home yet ill put them in my home again but theyre a very expensive option
4710704 a heat pump looks like an air conditioning unit that sits outside
4710705 its got a forced air unit in the house its all ducted and works very similar to your refrigerator it grabs the air and changes that either to cold or hot air through a condensing unit so it heats or cools your home
4710706 one thing thats important besides the r value of the home is how airtight the home is
4710707 youre going to lose heat part of that is because its going to go through the walls and outside but another part is that the wind is blowing air is moving outside and its coming in through cracks through electrical outlets and light fixtures and its going out somewhere else
4710708 certain costs like a heat pump are going to be relatively the same cost whether youre building a huge home or a smaller home
4710709 the way we do our insulating and air sealing of the walls the bigger you go the less the cost per square foot i would say for the average home we build it would add between 10 000 and 15 000
4710710 all of the heat is stored in the concrete floor with a thicker than normal slab
4710711 it takes the warm air either from the wood stove or from the sun and it circulates it into the floor where its stored and then it circulates it back out when its needed it runs all the time so youre either warming or cooling the floor depending on the temperature
4710712 i dont know how aware people are that we dont use oil because you come in the house and its always comfortable
4710713 the thing they notice more than the form of heat is how bright it is
4710714 i use the dishwasher instead of hand washing because it uses less water i need to heat up a washcloth for a compress on my eyes and i save the water in the sink to wash my hands with later
4710715 if i rinse lettuce i use the water to water the plants the well water is good enough to water the garden and we wash all the vegetables from the garden with that water
4710716 i never kept track of it i just smirk every time the oil truck delivers to the neighbours
4710717 when i left school it was always my intention to do housing only
4710718 over time that evolved into more and more and at one time we had as many four crews on the go we eventually scaled that back to two and in last five or six years just one
4710719 its same concrete the same glass the same wood theyre just put together differently its the quality of materials and construction that are more expensive not the fact that its solar
4710720 theres so much misinformation out there so many things people dont understand
4710721 over and over again we made architectural and technical design decisions that would yield an instrumentation framework that would be not just safe powerful and flexible but also usable the subtle bit here is that many of those decisions were not at the surface of the system where the discussion on the linux list seems to be currently mired but in its guts
4710722 over and over again we made architectural and technical design decisions that would yield a distributed vcs be not just safe powerful and flexible but also usable the subtle bit here is that many of those decisions were not at the surface of the system where the discussions going on at the moment seem to be currently mired but in its guts

4710725 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4710726 but it is connected organically to the provincial choral federations the chair of the board lives in manitoba but we function in the nether world of the internet
4710727 we meet as a board by conference calls every month we are an independent but national group who assess needs in co operation with provincial choral federations to design workshops in each province
4710728 basically it was in a dorm room at memorial university
4710729 about 10 of us were singing in the national youth choir the featured group at festival 500 we got together with conductor ewan edwards and dreamed up the canadian chamber choir our first tour was a year and a half later
4710730 music bridged the tide through those experiences it feeds into why i am so committed to the mandate of the ccc we think of choral music as relationship building because in order to sing well we have to function as a community it impacts the quality of the music
4710731 for me as a kid singing in local choirs was my vehicle for meeting friends even when feeling like a complete outsider
4710732 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
4710733 the minute something goes wrong everybodys got their tool boxes out
4710734 its guy stuff everybody gets the tools out and helps everybody out
4710735 we went and took a look got the warm and fuzzies
4710736 ive been in the club 17 18 years but weve had an airstream in the family since 1952
4710737 its a nice way to travel and see people in different parts of the country
4710738 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvellous marvellous engraver
4710739 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that travelling case and i hadnt travelled since that telethon til that day
4710740 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
4710741 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4710742 i have reported the matter to the cj as well as to the police
4710743 the matter is very sensitive and we are investigating it accordingly
4710744 though we have no information of his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts his name had cropped up days after the jaipur blasts
4710745 they begin to get the earliest forms of disability about 16 years later than do the controls
4710746 they have the same or fewer knee replacements or destroyed knees they have less musculoskeletal pain they spend less money on medical care expenses and by any metric that you use they have benefited from their lifelong exercise habit
4710747 compress the morbidity of the average life into a shorter and shorter period between when the disability comes and when one dies
4710748 this was a radical change in the way people were then thinking about it and there were no real data
4710749 the other third for the most part changed to other vigorous athletic activities and they changed for the reasons you wouldnt have thought they changed because they moved away or they lost their running partner everything but knee pain they never changed for knee pain almost never
4710750 they kept the habit of exercise although some people got bored with running and quit because they were bored
4710751 if we can deal with prevention of medical treatment through looking after ourselves better exercising vigorously eating well those sorts of factors then it makes sense that well have reduced disability and premature mortality
4710752 were all going to die some day but we want to compress that to the final days of our life if we can
4710753 they werent able to do that and nobody yet has been able to do that
4710754 they had reasonably good education they worked at a university so they dont include a complete cross section of society they dont include the migrant workers and the alcoholics under the bridge
4710755 i suppose the simplest one is that vigorous serious exercise regularly over a lifetime swapping off into another exercise if you have some difficulty with one of the exercises is a very very good way to go
4710756 the finding triggered worldwide research in creating corneal cells for therapeutic use
4710757 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4710758 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4710759 i was in high school when she hit it big
4710760 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4710761 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4710762 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4710763 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4710764 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4710765 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4710766 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4710767 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4710768 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4710769 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4710770 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4710771 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4710772 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4710773 it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response if so it could reverse the disease
4710774 we expect that this will suppress or regulate the auto immune response
4710775 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4710776 these are things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4710777 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4710778 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4710779 i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age for inventors
4710780 were a different breed from the victorians we have to be more commercially viable
4710781 theres always a positive on the back of a negative you have to be optimistic to do what we do
4710782 the history of humanity has always been a race between learning and disaster
4710783 the last game we were watching a lot of different guys in the huddle now we want to see that first group a little more disciplined and under control
4710784 whoever your quarterback is has got to be the best competitor on the team hes your leader right that goes for any offense
4710785 teammates will listen to you and be attentive to you in the huddle when you make plays that position is under great pressure and stress you gain their respect by how well you respond to adversity
4710786 as a great competitor and by playing consistently at a high level you command their respect and become a leader thats why leaders come in all shapes sizes and personalities
4710787 we went into camp short on numbers to begin with
4710788 this injury level is normal this has been normal for every camp ive been in
4710789 as long as i can get some reps in practice ill be ok
4710790 aan astrid gaat een ongelofelijk goede koningin voorbij albert is diezelfde mening toegedaan
4710791 dat heeft hij glashelder gemaakt toen hij het kernkabinet van de eerste regering verhofstadt heeft bijeengeroepen en letterlijk heeft gevraagd of er een mogelijkheid bestond om astrid tot regentes aan te duiden totdat elisabeth meerderjarig is dat bleek helaas niet mogelijk
4710792 astrid had het koningshuis dichter bij de mensen kunnen brengen net als albert een heel volkse koning is was zij een heel volkse koningin geworden

4710798 the breadth of the sigg collection offers a window not only onto the stunning changes in chinese art in the past decades but also onto the equally stunning changes that have taken place in chinese society and culture we are thrilled that uli sigg has made his collection available for this landmark exhibition
4710799 my experience in china since the late seventies first in the business world by establishing the first joint venture company between china and the west and later in the diplomatic arena has made me keenly aware of both the rapid changes in contemporary china and the fact that nothing was being done on an institutional level to preserve or document these developments in the artistic realm
4710800 therefore i determined early on in my collecting that my goal would be to collect as much for china as for myself someday when the conditions are right i am prepared to return this cultural legacy to the people of china
4710801 he came over the top of a stingray and a barb the stingrays barb went up and put a hole into his heart
4710802 we got him back within a couple of minutes to croc 1 which is steves research vessel and by 12 oclock when the emergency crew arrived they pronounced him dead

4710823 we met with gerards colleagues from the norit expedition team and in addition to providing us with information they shared in our grief we are now happy in the knowledge that our beloved gerard died a hero
4710824 gerard had made a phone call from the summit and was happy feeling strong and in the best of health two surviving climbers confirmed to us that gerard stopped on his descent to help three climbers who were in difficulty
4710825 after trying to assist the climbers gerard continued on his descent until he was hit by an ice fall resulting in his untimely death
4710826 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of gerard whose death has left a major void in our lives he brought honour not only to us his family but to the whole country when he became the first irishman to summit k2

4711094 my first guess as to why xapian returns more results would be that perhaps stemming is used there but not with the core search
4711095 if you want to tune xapian indexing performance setting xapian flush threshold in the environment to a larger value will speed things up if youve enough ram
4711096 if you compact the database first using xapian compact that should speed things up a bit

4711100 im not sure why it seems slightly slower though perhaps just chance which blocks happen to be near others so disk seeking times happen to be more or perhaps the faster code we use for a fully compact database isnt really faster and wed be better off using the same code all the time ill have to check that

4711111 and whatever you do whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
4711112 he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities for as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us

4711118 since then you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god 2 set your minds on things above not on earthly things 3 for you died and your life is now hidden with christ in god
4711119 put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature sexual immorality impurity lust evil desires and greed which is idolatry 6 because of these the wrath of god is coming b 7 you used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived 8 but now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these anger rage malice slander and filthy language from your lips 9 do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator 11 here there is no gentile or jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave or free but christ is all and is in all
4711120 so then just as you received christ jesus as lord continue to live in him rooted and built up in him strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness
4711121 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
4711122 put off the old self and put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator

4711135 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4711136 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4711140 i have selected a squad of 18 players as i think it is important that all the players are equal from the beginning there are a lot of games before we join up and i think it is better that we are prepared for any injuries
4711141 we were sixth last season and the goal is to be better this time
4711142 we were close to liverpool for a lot of time last season and now we have a stronger squad
4711143 there is no reason to believe that we cant reach the top four
4711144 it is my belief and i hope that everyone else believes it as well we have a chance to do it
4711145 this is a challenge for me and i do like a challenge there is a great environment at the club and i like the way that we all pull together
4711146 we are one unit and that is very important for me there is a great group of players here it is an ambitious young squad that can only get better and better
4711147 i am only 28 but i have been in the game a long time so i hope i can help the younger players
4711148 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times
4711149 he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem

4711151 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others

4711158 i think this is the best crowd we have had for a number of years and judging by smiles on faces throughout the past 10 days everyone has had a ball
4711159 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4711160 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4711161 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4711162 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4711163 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4711164 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4711165 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4711166 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4711167 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4711168 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4711169 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4711170 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4711171 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4711172 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4711173 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4711174 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4711175 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4711176 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4711177 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4711178 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4711179 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4711180 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4711181 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4711182 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4711183 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4711184 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4711185 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4711186 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4711187 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4711188 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4711189 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4711190 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4711191 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4711192 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4711193 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4711194 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4711195 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4711196 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4711197 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4711198 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4711199 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4711200 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4711201 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4711202 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4711203 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4711204 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4711205 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4711206 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4711207 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4711208 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4711209 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4711210 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4711211 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4711212 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4711213 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4711214 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4711215 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4711216 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4711217 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4711218 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4711219 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4711220 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4711221 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4711222 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4711223 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4711224 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4711225 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4711226 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4711227 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4711228 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4711229 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4711230 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4711231 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4711232 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4711233 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4711234 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4711235 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4711236 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4711237 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4711238 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4711239 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4711240 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4711241 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4711242 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4711243 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4711244 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4711245 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4711246 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4711247 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4711248 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years

4711290 mira una delegaci n tan joven como la que hemos tra do a los juegos ol mpicos de beijing 2008 me parece que los resultados han sido positivos pese a que s lo llevamos una medalla de bronce la mayor a de los deportistas que hoy est n aqu son menores de 25 a os tambi n hay que mencionar que han mejorado sus propias marcas
4711291 nosotros antes de salir a beijing hac amos el dictamen y este era muy claro queremos ser honestos y muy claros en lo que podr a suceder y hasta el momento est todo dentro de lo planeado
4711292 tal vez se nos cayeron las expectativas en cuanto a eder s nchez en caminata y juan ren serrano en tiro con arco pero es un buen trabajo el que estamos viendo
4711293 seguir insistiendo en no hablar de medallas porque ve amos venir esto podr a suceder y se est dando pueden ser una dos tres medallas pero lo que nosotros quer amos manifestar a toda la gente es que lo mas importante es el crecimiento de nuestro deporte tal vez eso no nos guste pero es lo que tenemos ser conscientes que es nuestra realidad
4711294 hab a que pensar en qu es lo que hoy realmente tenemos habr a que resaltar por ejemplo a mariana avitia en tiro con arco ella es producto de la olimpiada nacional al igual que juan ren serrano

4711298 daar wonen veel gelovigen en dus relatief veel mensen die hun geloof willen uitdragen maar zij hebben niet allemaal zin om naar oost groningen te verhuizen waar gemeentestichting misschien meer nut zou hebben daar komt bij dat je op de veluwe makkelijker medestanders vindt die met hun eigen kerk niet zo gelukkig zijn en makkelijk iets nieuws beginnen

4711305 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4711306 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4711307 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4711308 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4711312 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4711313 it notes that disclosures of information are penalized even where they are not harmful to national security

4711335 there was a question to maybe have a new governor
4711336 afghanistan is a sovereign state that makes its own decisions about government appointments i can assure you that canada fully respects this and is not calling for any changes to the afghan government
4711337 there remain very serious allegations against the former governor that he may have been directly and personally involved in serious human rights violations including torture
4711338 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4711339 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4711340 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4711341 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious

4711347 en el inta siguiendo la tendencia a nivel mundial del aprovechamiento de tratamiento de residuos estamos investigando en la certificaci n de la producci n de biocombustibles
4711348 por eso argentina tiene enormes ventajas comparativas por el amplio desarrollo que tiene la siembra directa a nivel nacional y la menor intensidad energ tica que estamos utilizando para generar nuestros productos agropecuarios

4711359 dann wird die linke daf r bei den nachfolgenden neuwahlen die quittung bekommen
4711360 en realidad nos importa mucho acercar la ltima tecnolog a al productor
4711361 is this something that i would want written about myself or someone close to me
4711362 the ps2 has sold 125 million units all over the world continuing to sell even now
4711363 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4711364 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4711365 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4711366 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4711367 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4711368 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4711369 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4711370 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4711371 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4711372 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4711373 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4711374 its a great opportunity to showcase our hospitality and the pristine waters of mahone bay
4711375 it gives a lot of local kids the opportunity to participate in a local championship
4711376 i think lunenburg sent three kids to nationals last year in montreal
4711377 they dont often get a chance to race in a fleet this big and against some of the best sailors in north america
4711378 it was important to make a few birdies to put my name up there and im glad everything went well
4711379 but i like to play in the last group i like to play on sundays to give myself a chance to win the tournament this has been a good year so far and hopefully we can continue with a win
4711380 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4711381 we came in here with high expectations of ourselves it was too soon to end it felt like there was a knife in my heart
4711382 weve been together for two years who knows where our program goes from here
4711383 it has been a wonderful nine years for me my family and the program
4711384 there has been development of the team and the program in canada
4711385 i hoped my team would finish with a good performance and a win in my last game we seemed to run out of gas early in the second half we kept fighting and we created a war but we couldnt play the good performances we have played before they worked hard as they can i have no problem with the results
4711386 but to lose the quarter finals in the olympics its a little hard to accept right now
4711387 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 per cent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4711388 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4711389 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4711390 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4711391 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4711392 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4711393 he wont play tomorrow and his next target is our first home game with bolton wanderers next weekend
4711394 its a tough target but one we are hoping he will get to
4711395 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good
4711396 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4711397 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4711398 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4711399 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night
4711400 but we will see an improvement at the weekend we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time
4711401 its too bad they the tremaine sisters didnt meet but it seems the final would come down to who would face sarah
4711402 farina is playing very well and anyone can win it for farina its about not having any nerves out there it should be an exciting match
4711403 you have a baseliner in jockel against an all court player in becker
4711404 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared toward qualifying
4711405 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4711406 i felt good and relaxed i just wanted to make it through
4711407 were at the low level right now and its going to take time
4711408 if that means trying to get it right with six seven or eight sports i would rather do that than try to go too wide
4711409 beijing is an indicator of what the gap is between us and our competitors
4711410 we do need to take a look at strategic investments in some of those sports where we could put in 300 000 or 400 000 and get some results
4711411 australia did it all the time in archery for example but we have to have the right information
4711412 if we dont have the expertise in canada then we need to go overseas and get them there but we have to be careful that we dont say were going to pay a coach a huge salary and then not give him the tools to do the job
4711413 ive come from a system where often in the early days so many services were pushed on sport they didnt know which ones were the important ones
4711414 i do believe we shouldnt be here just to participate
4711415 ive never believed in just making the national team and being happy and satisfied with that
4711416 if our athletes are here there should be a realistic chance to get to the podium
4711417 it was important to make a few birdies to put my name up there and im glad everything went well
4711418 but i like to play in the last group i like to play on sundays to give myself a chance to win the tournament this has been a good year so far and hopefully we can continue with a win
4711419 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4711420 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4711421 i felt good and relaxed i just wanted to make it through
4711422 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared toward qualifying
4711423 the experts arent sure if these dinosaurs are male or female so send us whatever names you think fit

4711426 dicen que me burlo de todo que me r o de todo porque me burlo de ellos y me r o de ellos y ellos creen serlo todo
4711427 i mean really its nothing a centimetres nothing but thats the way it is
4711428 its probably something that will be in the back of my mind for as long as i live to come that close is a little crushing i definitely dont want to relive that moment again but im positive and ill just move forward
4711429 we took a very business like approach to the race
4711430 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1 000 metres we owned it
4711431 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4711432 i was incredibly nervous the entire morning leading up to the competition and i didnt really know why
4711433 what happened today is good but im going to leave it behind me and know that saturday we all start at zero
4711434 a big high and then six outs away from even a higher high
4711435 we just couldnt execute in key situations and it came back to bite us
4711436 one pitch and the guy capitalized on it and it turned out to be the difference of the ballgame
4711437 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them and money is tight
4711438 its not only youth filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
4711439 are more expensive but also provide more privacy and luxury
4711440 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
4711441 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and travelling
4711442 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience
4711443 for the time we were in italy we stayed in budget hotels and by the end of it we were excited to get back to staying in larger rooms with more people
4711444 um no i dont think i have anything to prove to them rodgers told reporters in green bay on thursday
4711445 id like to throw a couple touchdowns for sure but i just want to play well
4711446 now is that because quarterbacks coach tom clements developed him to that point which i think is a big part of it
4711447 hes a lot more athletic than i realized coming out
4711448 i still think alex has a lot of football in front of him
4711449 but i still do have friends in that organization on the coaching staff and i do hope for those guys to have success
4711450 looking back i know things happen for a reason he said
4711451 im in a great situation and i wish the 49ers well
4711452 hello come on in have a cup of tea and a biscuit
4711453 here let me take your suitcase and when you get comfortable come down for a glass of wine

4711457 i always keep michael gray in the bathroom he was talking about another george who is it oh yeah van morrison
4711458 whee weet any longer for the one you love when hes standing in front of you
4711459 what do you want me to do fall asleep onstage
4711460 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4711461 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4711462 didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4711463 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4711464 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4711465 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4711466 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4711467 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4711468 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4711469 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4711470 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4711471 his voice sounded very strong and his laughter his spirit was great
4711472 because im concentrating on the autobiography so im telling stories as much as i am singing
4711473 everyone assumes that people like me never make mistakes or have problems
4711474 they think youre not appearing on carson or leno anymore because you choose not to be
4711475 after janis sang her song at seventeen one of the first times she played that to a large audience here
4711476 dylan went over to her and complimented her on it she was on cloud nine
4711477 i rode back to the hotel on his lap and he made an inarticulate proposition which i declined in favor of going back to brombergs room for a late night jam
4711478 i came of age in new york but i grew up in philly
4711479 i started to write and make records in new york but i really became a person in philadelphia its always been incredibly supportive of me as a town
4711480 i went through all my old journals i spent a lot of time googling myself its a weird feeling to research yourself
4711481 and hard to write about being smacked in the head
4711482 the year before the olympics is usually our dismal year and then bang it goes up again
4711483 those who are in it are really in it and those who arent dont know anything about it
4711484 we do tend to see an increase in the number of patients after something like the olympics
4711485 dann m ssen auch die inhaltlichen mindestbedingungen der linken zum tragen kommen
4711486 dann muss man mit uns auch das gesamte personaltableau bereden
4711487 dann wird die linke daf r bei den nachfolgenden neuwahlen die quittung bekommen
4711488 die alternative w re nicht politik und das ist der untergang
4711489 dann kann die spd bei der n chsten bundestagswahl davon profitieren
4711490 i dont know what to say ive been dreaming of this moment for a long time and its here im just so proud to be canadian
4711491 i know that weve got more coming i know we do but its nice to be the first one
4711492 when shes wrestling her best she is very very quick very tricky to wrestle
4711493 people have a hard time getting a handle on her carol is someone you cant relax on because the second you do shell pick you apart
4711494 if there are two americans and one russian we win
4711495 you know the water in luang prabang province is going down so it may reach vientiane tomorrow or the day after
4711496 we will try as hard as we can to avoid the water flooding our capital so we will not stop building the 2 5m sandbag wall
4711497 after we finish building that wall we will wait and see what the situation is like
4711498 but they have gas and charcoal to cook with and are using candles for lighting their houses in place of electricity

4711512 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4711513 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4711514 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4711515 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4711516 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4711517 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4711518 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4711519 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4711520 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4711521 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4711522 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation

4711528 in marriage there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry look where i will i see that it is so and i feel that it must be so when i consider that it is of all transactions the one in which people expect most from others and are least honest themselves
4711529 one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty

4711536 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4711537 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4711538 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4711539 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4711540 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4711541 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4711542 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4711543 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4711544 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4711545 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4711546 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4711547 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4711548 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4711549 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4711550 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4711551 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4711552 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4711553 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4711554 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4711555 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4711556 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4711557 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4711558 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4711559 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4711560 without the active help of pakistani agencies it would not have been possible to move her sister outside pakistani territory
4711561 for the purpose of hiding allens involvement in the transaction
4711562 i grew up watching ed mcmahon i think hes a terrific guy
4711563 even a man who hadnt had such a great career shouldnt have this happen to them in their later years im doing my best but this is a very difficult situation
4711564 lets just see what the deal is and what were offered
4711565 in a typical deal the person who buys it is doing it as an investment because its a good piece of property
4711566 so they expect the person living there to cover the carrying costs the insurance the gardening the utilities the taxes when a persons in trouble they dont even have the money to even do that so a lot of them go very sour
4711567 youre acting as a child protecting your parent theyre hoping itll be a good investment but if not its going to be there
4711568 he doesnt tie up 4 8 million in cash to own a 4 8 million asset
4711569 its clear mr kilpatrick knew who detective white was he specifically called him by name
4711570 his purpose for going out there is subject to question
4711571 he grabbed me with both hands around my shoulders and he threw me he threw me into investigator kinney
4711572 when they get to his house they know its not his house
4711573 at that point its over there is no interference with a government officer
4711574 the next thing i know he came out the door and he grabbed brian
4711575 he was cursing and telling us to get off the property get off my property get these people off my property i mean he was just screaming yelling and i was just standing there in disbelief because i couldnt believe mr mayor would do something like that
4711576 weve been very careful not to litigate this in the press
4711577 we believe it was isolated brief and on point with our theory of the case
4711578 very strong very direct the defense is just swinging wild
4711579 the bottom line is they were assaulted while doing their job
4711580 yet another example of irresponsible publicity hungry security researchers trying to grab a few headlines
4711581 when you discover major flaws in a system that society relies on you go to the people who own the system and work with them
4711582 you dont stand up on a podium and say look how clever i am
4711583 you can store the value on the card you just have to combine it with salt and encrypt it against a big enough private key shouldnt be hard in this day and age
4711584 many see the temporary restraining order preventing three mit undergrads from publicly discussing vulnerabilities they discovered in bostons mass transit system as a violation of their first amendment rights others though see the entire episode as yet another example of irresponsible publicity hungry security researchers trying to grab a few headlines
4711585 we adviseren zelfs niet te beleggen nu snijden we daarmee in ons vlees door minder inkomsten op termijn profiteren we
4711586 niets wat het vertrouwen van particulieren in van lanschot zal herstellen en ik ben een optimist maar ook begin 2009 zie ik geen verbetering
4711587 maar wij zijn als een van de zeer weinige banken in barre tijden niet afhankelijk van de markt
4711588 er is een crisis op de aandelenmarkten gecombineerd met de angst voor een recessie en banken die hun balansen aan het leegpompen zijn omdat ze miljarden hebben afgeboekt ik loop al lang mee maar dit is een heel nieuwe ervaring
4711589 de vraag is of je je bij dat soort bedrijven de integratie op de hals wilt halen
4711590 my son was perfectly healthy when he went in there
4711591 there is not a day that goes by that this doesnt disturb me just because you are incarcerated doesnt mean you dont deserve medical care
4711592 we are always exploring ways to enhance our operation which includes keeping our employees and inmates safe
4711593 despite our best efforts some inmates are successful in committing suicide in our facility
4711594 when you do a crime of that nature youve got to be held accountable
4711595 he is my brother still and i ultimately would like to see him serve his sentence in canada for one reason the possibility of visitation is a little bit easier and just the conditions might be a bit better in canada
4711596 we congratulate the local united food and commercial workers canada union and workers at gatineau que tire and lube operation on being the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4711597 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labour agreement
4711598 their know how their experience their ability in co ordinating in kosovo i expect will make a real difference
4711599 weve lived here for fairly a long time and we want to embellish the community
4711600 this continues to take prince georges county to another level
4711601 the konterra town center offers the kind of density and diversity that is critical to the future of the county
4711602 i think if the canadian public really knew the extent of harm that asbestos has caused i think there would be an outrage over what the federal government is doing
4711603 i cannot describe to you the public health epidemic that unfolded before us and is still happening
4711604 were probably the only industrialized country not tracking the extent of the disease and its impact on our society
4711605 certainly the government will not support anything that may be viewed as critical of asbestos when theyre the chief cheerleaders for the asbestos industry
4711606 thank you queensland for your support and love for the show
4711607 i think this is the best crowd we have had for a number of years and judging by smiles on faces throughout the past 10 days everyone has had a ball
4711608 thank you queensland for your support and love for the show
4711609 were trying to put together all the information and figure out what happened
4711610 he was a man of integrity and honour a modern day knight
4711611 i think being a family man is what drew him toward the toronto fire services the brotherhood that he truly believed in
4711612 i am sure every historian archeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4711613 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4711614 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4711615 im told two things that its neither classified nor secret and that its stuff that could be available under access to information
4711616 at the beginning i was really nervous because its a huge animal
4711617 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
4711618 we were very close to the animal actually we were touching it with the canoe when we struck at the beginning
4711619 theyre so proud of the hunters and for the community
4711620 we identified that there was a sufficient number of whales to allow three hunts in nunavut and nunavik
4711621 i have heard that they get anywhere from 70 to 200
4711622 people start up the vehicle and it sounds like a motorcycle
4711623 if you are driving through a parking lot and see somebody tinkering they may be up to no good
4711624 the church is a stabilizing factor in the black community and while we looked at other locations we prayerfully decided to remain in this community
4711625 racism abounded in maryland as it did in mississippi and pastors were not only called to preach but to lead their community toward racial integration and desegregation
4711626 she was a very very kind person always smiling and happy just a great person with a big heart
4711627 this is just totally devastating for this town everybody knows everybody its too tragic to put into words we just dont understand how the vehicle got there in the first place
4711628 aspyn was really bubbly and always fully of energy madison was quieter until you got to know her charlene always had a smile and always had something positive to say they were just such good people
4711629 well you know that kind of tells you the interest
4711630 he basically wrote off newfoundland and labrador and atlantic canada in the beginning when he said we had a culture of defeat
4711631 he pays lip service to newfoundland and labrador he was in atlantic canada because hes scrambling for seats to get a majority government but as ive said before if he gets a majority government god help us all
4711632 negligently acted for his own and azans personal financial gain by ensuring that ben did not have an experienced family member to assist ben and oversee all of his matters
4711633 the negligence and dishonesty of the defendant has caused the plaintiff considerable financial hardship personal stress and inconvenience
4711634 totally out of his depth in this very sophisticated international sports arena
4711635 will be fighting this vehemently they do not believe there is any truth to any of the allegations
4711636 this claim is frivolous unmeritorious and an abuse of process of this honourable court
4711637 as dependent on adult direction and advice as the average six or seven year old
4711638 hunting is important to us inuit food from the south is expensive but country food wild meat is free
4711639 taking the mikmaq thing out of it cornwallis was not very just to acadians either
4711640 there should be a good interpretive panel there that would explain two sides of the story
4711641 he was a small boy who was barely starting his life id rather it was me in his place because i have already lived longer
4711642 he was the smallest in the family of three sisters and two brothers but he helped us all
4711643 we dont want it to take centuries to get a response about the cause of brothers death which to us as a family appears clear
4711644 what i can say for the moment is if its necessary we will ask for it
4711645 we dont want any violence because of that violence my brother is dead
4711646 i have full confidence in them i think theyre professional theyre competent they have the experience and i think that they will continue to do what they have been doing for decades
4711647 i think that the security of the population is important and the police force has an important role to play to maintain that
4711648 i dont think you can control all the world from one center
4711649 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4711650 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4711651 if its in our neighborhood we definitely dont want to see it
4711652 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4711653 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4711654 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4711655 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4711656 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4711657 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4711658 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realizes that reforms are necessary
4711659 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4711660 europe should realize that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4711661 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4711662 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4711663 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4711664 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4711665 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4711666 overthrow americas century of regime change from hawaii to iraq
4711667 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4711668 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
4711669 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
4711670 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4711671 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4711672 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4711673 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4711674 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
4711675 try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4711676 the only way to cure its constitutional infirmity is to dismiss the indictment in its entirety
4711677 criminal case against senator stevens is not based on his legislative activities but on his receipt of financial benefits and his need to conceal those benefits from public scrutiny
4711678 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4711679 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4711680 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4711681 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbors
4711682 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4711683 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4711684 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4711685 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4711686 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4711687 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4711688 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4711689 il y a des dizaines de bless s et nous continuons extraire les corps
4711690 its sore every day its time to give him a break
4711691 det har f rst rt mycket f r mig och min partner
4711692 i remember the first formula one test that i did in valencia in 2000
4711693 being a street track it will have that extra bit of flair and it will be a real buzz for the drivers to learn a new track it will be dusty to start with so they will need to increase their speed steadily because the barriers will be very unforgiving i really like street circuits and it would be cool to be racing this weekend
4711694 i raced at valencia the weekend before the hungarian grand prix in a gt sportscar
4711695 theres a small bump as you go on and off the astilleros bridge which could unsettle the cars in the wet and then theres a 90 degree right before the track drops away and you head down a long curved straight
4711696 you brake really hard for turn 12 and it is here that it feels most like a street circuit because there are traffic lights hanging across the track and you can see buildings
4711697 valencia is often thought of as a temporary race venue however it is actually a permanent street circuit which is quite fast and flowing its not like the type of street circuit that we have been used to racing around in monaco there has been some racing around the track already with sportscars and spanish f3 so we have been gathering information from those races to see what we can learn in advance of the race weekend valencia is going to be a medium to low downforce track with a couple of quick corners which will present a very challenging circuit in an exciting environment one of the key aspects is that it is going to be very windy the americas cup is held in valencia for this very reason however such conditions could make achieving a good balance on the cars quite tricky the valencia weekend is going to be a fascinating engineering challenge for the team and we are all looking forward to it
4711698 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4711699 you have a great concept there but we dont have time to tackle it now
4711700 or call 877 333 9940 ext 2 for press credentials please contact linda robins by emailing linda coredjs gmail com
4711701 if youre a dj and youre passionate about what you do you dont sleep thats what we do core djs is about that
4711702 well i really hope there isnt one to tell you the truth but now adays there always seems to be some kind of catch of some sort and it usually doesnt even matter if you have nothing to offer you still need to give maybe hobos have something going for them afterall
4711703 oh thankyou who are you may i ask and why is everyone happy once they meet you are you from a different world or do you just think so much differently than most people that its just almost as if you are from a different world
4711704 if i know you need something you dont have to ask me ill just help you out this is something most people dont have people have to people without them knowing anything about it yet these people are usually afaird to ask even their closest friends for help rather it be something real simple or something real emotional and because of all this alienation from one another its almost as if weve all forgotten that were on this earth together as a people not as indivduals so what happens as time passes on by us we actually start thinking for ourselves and after awhile we forget about asking people if we dont know the answer to something we want to know its called evolution but through it all it starts pulling us apart as well if this shit keeps up im afraid were going to be asexual in our next eon on this planet and why do i know all of this because i stay up late at night pondering our existence not just my own existence but all of us together and what we mean to one another usually people just think about themselves its not necessarily a selfish act i mean you have to think about what your future is going to bring to you and everything so after awhile people think about this so much that they forget to think about anything else truth be told we really only think about our friends and other people we know once were actually hanging out with them or talking to them on the phone so i go from place to place just looking at people and getting somewhat a sense of what kind of person they are and when people understand that i understand them it brightens up their world a little bit people are always happy when someone understands them and where theyre coming from thats what it means to be a friend i might not have anyone to hang out with but i see most people so in a way no one ive ever met isnt a friend of mine now so i assure you there is no catch im just here and as here as here can be
4711705 its all very intersting every word of it so what are you still doing here
4711706 well youre the girl that knows everything why dont you tell me
4711707 i may be able to know many things just by looking but im not one of those bitches that pokes her nose into places that she should really wait until she has permission to do
4711708 im here on a whim knowing if i can get the musicains i perfer that actually do want to play my music all i have to do is to tell them what to play where i know exactly what i want and id be able to bring out the music i want to bring out faster if i dont have to write any of it down i want to bring out detailed booklets with each of the albums i bring out that has a photo or maybe even more for each song thats on the able with lyrics plastered off to the side out of the way of the picture but i want to be a little older even if its just a year before i pose for the pictures that i want to take in order to make my songs come more alive than i ever thought possible in the past and years from now people will have no idea how it was so easy for me just to tell people what i wanted to hear the songs sound like they took years to write and ill tell them that thats the idea theyll say that it sounds like so much was going through my head at the time that i wrote the pieces and almost as if i thought of more and more the more into the song we recorded and then ill just look at them and smile because theyve finally understood why i went about doing things the way i wanted to do them with nothing written down comes ideas to an imagination that you just have to go with in these cases paper is too limited you just have to go with it id rather go up on stage and talk to the people looking up and listening without writing anything down first you dull yourself the more you have to write to get the idea out of the music that youll play for an audience later on imagine what was going through classical composers minds when they wrote some of the greatest songs ever to be written you never can tell people your imagination as perfect as it can become if you just decide to not speak and write however much you can until your hands too tired to write anymore and youre too annoyed to write down any more notes

4711760 finalmente arrivata questa medaglia in campo mondiale non ne avevo mai presa una questa la prima e veramente me la tengo stretta vicino al cuore che per me veramente importante non pensavo che facessero questo tempo pensavo che io avrei fatto un pochino di meno per l8 e 14 della adlington veramente un tempone e le faccio i complimenti perch veramente forte
4711761 un ritmo veramente folle e io nelle gambe quel ritmo l non ce lavevo

4711765 ho provato a far la scremata intorno al decimo chilometro sembrava di riuscirci ma in effetti no perch poi al quattordicesimo han dato la stoccata terribile ho provato a stare con loro ma realmente era un ritmo veramente folle han dato una cambiata a 3 e 40 e io nelle gambe quel ritmo l non ce lavevo non ho patito pi di tanto il caldo anche perch comunque vivendo a milano sono abituato a soffrire proprio nel quotidiano sia dinverno che destate quindi diciamo che mi sono ambientato e adattato abbastanza bene devo mandare gi il boccone tra virgolette amaro perch comunque un quinto posto alle olimpiadi non si butta mai via assolutamente e diciamo che da atene a londra questa proprio una tappa intermedia credo proprio di lavorare gi nei primi giorni di settembre con la testa a londra

4711778 the catholic schools in the camden diocese are not closing but changing
4711779 the closeness and the family atmosphere will be the same as when sacred heart school joined with annunciation school in school the students will see the friends they see every day and the teachers will be the neighbors and role models they see every day

4711782 zardari is not an option sharif is not an option
4711783 but nawaz sharif and asif zardari are unelected theyre not just unrepresentative in that they dont hold seats in the parliament they have absolutely no mandate in pakistan they head the two largest and most corrupt parties in the state but hold no public office the rest of the coterie that wields power behind this administration the attorney general and the interior minister for instance also happen to be unelected they serve and i use the term ever so lightly by appointment only some 170 million pakistanis have lived under military rule of law for nine years musharraf stepping down from his army post has not changed that neither did the recent selections sorry i meant elections obviously
4711784 and what has this thriving democratic union accomplished it passed the national reconciliation ordinance an odious piece of legislation that wipes out 15 years worth of corruption cases against politicians suspiciously covering 11 years of ppp and pml rule bankers and bureaucrats were also given the all clear worse still the ordinance contains a clause that makes it virtually impossible for future charges to be filed against sitting parliamentarians but they must have done more than that surely well all that really changed is that food inflation has accelerated oil subsidies have been cut gas prices have doubled and those pesky militants in the swat district the tribal regions have turned up the fighting
4711785 it new delhis view is not suggested it is clearly said that the isi is fermenting trouble in kashmir they have been fermenting trouble in kashmir for years again you have a situation where part of it is outside particularly from pakistan and the other side has been doing so for decades not just the past few weeks
4711786 similarly there is evidence that the isi has been active on the afghanistan border recently there were accusations about the isi involvement in the kabul indian embassy attack on july 7 i mean these are just tip of the iceberg its interesting now its not the isi that is possibly doing something new its the fact that the international community accepts its and can say it publicly and thats the major difference not the action themselves
4711787 the question is very bizarre to start with in a sense that political instability is already there but i mean don t forget that pervez musharraf himself is part of this political instability by staying on he clearly ignored the result of the february 2008 election and therefore creating frustration in the population so his departure is likely to lessen the tension not increase it
4711788 to an extent it is true that musharraf had at least contributed to the significant improvement of relations between the two and for a long time there is a new perception that his departure would be a problem for that very reason at the same time this is not the impeachment of musharraf or the beginning of the process which has started the deterioration of relations with india
4711789 what we have seen since the beginning of the summer resumption of the situation on the attack of all kind in a sense including their embassy in afghanistan so the deterioration was there anyway it would not be changed by the impeachment process itself
4711790 it depends on the kind of movies you want to make

4711800 and he burned burned burned in a burning ring of chocolate
4711801 what do you think about claiming to be the cadbury sisters see if we get in for free
4711802 yah i dont know if you know but were kinda a big deal nearly as big a deal as the wonka kids
4711803 if id wanted to pay for chocolate i wouldve just went to coles and picked up a packet of eclairs
4711804 how can you decide what chocolate is best if you cant tell which tastes better
4711805 well whats the point in that if its chocolate you dont buy a box of chocolates to take them home and just look at them
4711806 well you wouldnt eat something if it looked disgusting would you
4711807 oh william you make drinking a bottle of milk look like the hardest thing in the world to do
4711808 when clearly the hardest thing to do is find free chocolate at a bloody chocolate festival
4711809 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4711810 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4711811 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4711812 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4711813 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4711814 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4711815 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4711816 kate im here with you thanks for the lovely saturday together

4711818 he said penny i have a better life for you not only now but forever
4711819 that is what happened don it was crazy god said it i got really freaked out about it you know i thought maybe it was the drugs but i knew at the same time it wasnt the drugs
4711820 i should read you my journal from that night it was like oh my god god talked to me i am having this trippy god thing right now
4711821 i saw it every single day when i woke up
4711822 it gave me extra inspiration knowing that in just a few months i could have one of those of my own
4711823 she was definitely in her zone and on her game especially these last few weeks
4711824 she was just getting going at national championships and the trials you could tell what she was planning and hoping to do
4711825 i saw it every single day when i woke up
4711826 it gave me extra inspiration knowing that in just a few months i could have one of those of my own
4711827 she was definitely in her zone and on her game especially these last few weeks
4711828 she was just getting going at national championships and the trials you could tell what she was planning and hoping to do
4711829 we all want each other to be good but were all pushing
4711830 youve just got to go in and do what you know how to do its not a make or break situation
4711831 making sure you have all the right guys in there breaking the huddle at the right time getting in and out
4711832 when you lose three starters and when you dont have the quality depth its a concern
4711833 we have to put our heads together and find a way to protect those guys and find a way to put them in a position where we dont expose them
4711834 were a little inexperienced but i think were pretty good ballhawks
4711835 we might even be better at that than we were last year what we need to be better at is stopping the run because thats where keyes and horton made their money
4711836 but we cant get hurt youve got to stay healthy then we can develop these younger guys
4711837 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4711838 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4711839 from that point on we really had some solid at bats and we were able to string some things together
4711840 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4711841 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4711842 from that point on we really had some solid at bats and we were able to string some things together
4711843 this skinny white guy working with all those hip black guys
4711844 he looked at me a little weary like being unique was a tired substitute for being popular
4711845 great things are happening with the love middlesbrough campaign and we are aware of the importance of the football club as the highest profile organisation in the area
4711846 matches at the riverside are beamed all over the world and we can be our best ambassadors
4711847 people need to be more aware about what is available to them
4711848 help is certainly out there but unless you know where to look accessing it can be incredibly difficult
4711849 we are lucky that our lawyers helped us get the support we need from social services
4711850 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4711851 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people
4711852 we are currently investigating this as a possible motive for the killings
4711853 it played a critical part we could not get high enough with our own equipment and it provided a birds eye view
4711854 the thermal imaging camera can find what we call hotspots it could see where the fire was at its hottest so we could direct our resources there and save time
4711855 more proof of the need to keep the police helicopter based at durham tees valley airport serving the people of county durham
4711856 waiting for the aircraft based at newcastle to arrive could have severely hampered the fire brigades efforts in containing and controlling the fire
4711857 well done to all concerned in the air and on the ground
4711858 the helicopter was able to direct the fire brigade to deal with the blaze more effectively
4711859 at one point the crew took on board a senior fire officer and he could see the hotspots under the tiles before the flames shot through the roof
4711860 the officers have been commended for their professionalism and dedication resulting in the successful prosecution of a man who made and distributed child pornography images
4711861 to date this is the worst case of its kind handled by the force when considering the volume of images involved and the seriousness of their content
4711862 the officers actions were in the best traditions of durham police and a firstclass example of dedicated police work
4711863 it is fair to say that this was quite a complex case
4711864 both dc wraith and dc robson had to look at thousands of very disturbing images which cannot have been easy for either of them
4711865 despite this though they were unswerving in their endeavour to identify the offences and bring the offender to justice
4711866 perry phoned me straight away he just said he was driving and they got hit he said he was all right
4711867 he wont talk about it i am leaving it until he comes home all i am doing is talking to him over the internet
4711868 wayne and i talked via the internet he said perry had invited him down and he asked me what the nightlife was like perry was also going to go down to leeds
4711869 i am just over the moon that he is coming home i cant wait
4711870 the kids dont know whether they are coming or going
4711871 we are definitely going to have a big party i hope lots of family and friends will come we are all making banners for him
4711872 he loves football and rugby he went to australia and played rugby for the army he likes all sports

4711884 last week i had a mishap when i fell of the footpath between mc donalds roundabout and the church area i was also blodied and in shock a gentleman came to my assistance lifted me up and asked if he should ring an ambulance for me which i replied no thanks he then went back to his car put on hazard lights brought tissues from his car and attended to me as i was in shock at the time i forgot to ask him his name or to take his car registration number just in case this person happens to browse this website i would just like to say this was and is a true gentleman if you would like to contact me i have left my number at crc fm
4711885 a decision to do a product could take few months in some cases to couple of hours in other cases the source of ideas can be from anywhere they come from internal teams in some cases or it could even come from you earlier this year when we released zoho writer and sheet we didnt have fixed plans on doing a presentation app but then users started asking us about release dates of our presentation app we quickly setup a team for zoho show during jan and then released zoho show in june now thats all history

4711891 for some people there appears to be a benefit of moving however it is unclear if that is more about the people involved or the act of moving
4711892 its a complex picture and i dont think the research is definitive

4711896 humiliation emotional distress diminution of reputation loss of enjoyment of life extreme personal inconvenience loss of feeling of personal security and intangible injury
4711897 the manner in which the information was obtained and the seriousness of the firebombing that was being investigated weigh in favour of a finding that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy
4711898 you people cant exist its impossible nobody can help me you cant be talking to me how can you be talking to me
4711899 weve got to be able to do something for the garys of the world

4711906 but it happened to be the direct opposite if i wouldve glided i wouldve ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision
4711907 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

4711910 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4711911 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4711912 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4711913 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

4711926 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4711927 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4711928 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4711929 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4711930 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4711931 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4711932 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4711933 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4711934 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4711935 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4711936 this is a very dear and honoured member of the profession whom we want to celebrate but hes not entitled to provide architectural services without being registered and hes not
4711937 we cant make an exception for arthur because hes arthur
4711938 i dont know what theyre doing it doesnt make sense im not calling myself something im not
4711939 to suggest that arthur erickson is deliberately misrepresenting himself as an architect is like suggesting that einstein was not a physicist in his later years arthur erickson has been an architect for 50 years and he cannot help it if people continue to call him one regardless of the aibcs opinion on the matter
4711940 a discussion between two architects and we agree on the result
4711941 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4711942 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4711943 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4711944 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4711945 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4711946 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied
4711947 this wasnt a visit it was telling me to go away and never come back
4711948 we are seeing more investment in social and supportive housing than ever in the history of the city
4711949 the downtown eastside will be for many years a place you find people of low incomes
4711950 there has been an effort to keep all the social problems in one neighbourhood and i do not think that serves the people who have those problems very well
4711951 we find that when they can move outside the downtown eastside a lot of problems go away
4711952 when you start having numbers of people camping out you start moving into personal safety issues
4711953 before anyone could be harmed a solution even short term needed to be found
4711954 le renforcement du parti au sein des organismes de presse
4711955 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4711956 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4711957 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4711958 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4711959 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4711960 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4711961 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4711962 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4711963 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4711964 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4711965 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4711966 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4711967 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4711968 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4711969 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4711970 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4711971 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4711972 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4711973 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4711974 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4711975 dass er nur wegen seines speziellen schwimmanzugs so schnell schwimmt kann ich mir nicht vorstellen
4711976 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4711977 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4711978 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4711979 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4711980 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4711981 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4711982 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4711983 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4711984 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4711985 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4711986 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4711987 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4711988 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4711989 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4711990 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4711991 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4711992 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4711993 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4711994 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4711995 new book out and making the move to open access
4711996 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4711997 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4711998 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4711999 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4712000 well maybe theyre just not sure theyll get enough of an audience because its animated
4712001 hey why is this box moving why does it have feet and why does it seem to be arguing with itself

4712019 to tell the truth communication with foreign friends has not been too successful
4712020 the fact is 95 percent of us cant speak english
4712021 ive had some foreign passengers but all we could do is nod at each other then i look at the business cards they give me and i take them there
4712022 i think it helped a bit in understanding if they speak slowly

4712050 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4712051 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4712052 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4712053 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009

4712156 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem

4712158 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others

4712160 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4712161 and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and this will take some doing because they are quality players who are going out
4712162 immediately after the mens 100m butterfly we got an official written protest from serbia which was questioning the arrival of phelps as being too fast
4712163 under our rules we do listen to protests we looked at video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second after phelps one was stroking and one was gliding
4712164 a equipe entrou muito concentrada no jogo no primeiro tempo encontramos mais espa os para os arremessos da linha de seis metros e na segunda parte o maik fez boas defesas o que nos proporcionou contra ataques perigosos

4712175 it is a change that is much needed some three hundred million people on the continent live in poverty with little or no access to the most basic resources in the past quarter century during which 500 million people managed to escape poverty worldwide the number of poor in sub saharan africa nearly doubled
4712176 it is clear to me that one issue above others will determine africas future good governance it is central to the effective administration of a states resources the rule of law the creation of a functioning private sector and the development of a strong civil society
4712177 niger is the worst affected country children are starving to death every day in parts of the south aid agencies say the world food programme says that 2 5m people need food aid almost a quarter of the population
4712178 northern areas of mali which border the sahara desert are also suffering acute food shortages a recent survey showed that 16 of people in the regions of gao and kidal were acutely malnourished wfp says the government says 1 5m people need food aid
4712179 mauritania was worst hit by last years locust invasions which have worsened the effects of poor rains across the region but it has a much smaller population and so fewer people 600 000 need help than in niger and mali
4712180 some one hundred thousand people have died of aids and more than 700 000 children have lost one or both parents to this preventable disease that if not tackled directly by government policy has the potential of evolving into a raging pandemic to date only 3 of those needing anti retroviral treatment are receiving it
4712181 have the power to pick and choose which content and which applications run on their network
4712182 one important fact about this is that they just werent straight that it took forever to get them to admit what in fact they were doing secondly they were doing something which most network technologists would say has nothing to do with really preserving the efficiency of the network but is instead about being able to exercise control over what happens on their network
4712183 the internet is fast becoming and is taken for granted as a basic utility used for myriad of social educational and work related tasks
4712184 there is little evidence that would help assess whether discrimination that harms consumers is likely
4712185 there is little evidence of actual anticompetitive conduct by broadband providers
4712186 consumers arguably are better served by unregulated and hopefully shorter lived monopoly than regulated semi permanent monopoly
4712187 what we need is public policy thats driven by the public by institutions in the public that set the rules that lead companies to do the right thing
4712188 whether the network owner wants to make what we want available to the consumer so it radically changes what the internet is and makes it something much less vibrant and potential for democracy and free speech
4712189 has cited several examples of discrimination of internet service providers in recent years
4712190 if network operators are allowed to restructure their networks many lower income people could be increasingly shut out of the opportunities that the internet is supposed to offer to all of us
4712191 the bottom line is that cable and telephone companies understand the changing climate of the industry and the potential for profits government under the mantra of market forces and bent on deregulation must also be petitioned by advocates of the public interest
4712192 the most important thinker on intellectual property in the internet era
4712193 effect upon how culture is made that change will radically transform a tradition that is as old as the republic itself
4712194 the technology that preserved the balance in our history between uses of our culture that were free and uses that were only upon permission has been undone
4712195 whether piracy will be permitted and whether property will be protected and frame it as a battle about the rule of law and respect for property
4712196 if piracy means using the creative property of others without their permission if value then right is true then the history of the content industry is a history of piracy every important sector of big media today film records radio and cable tv was born of a kind of piracy so defined
4712197 unlike the problem of whether you have any copyright protection at all the problem here is whether copyright holders who are already compensated and who already have a monopoly should be permitted to extend that monopoly the question here is how much compensation they should have and how far back they should carry their right to compensation
4712198 attempting to respond to something very new by destroying something very old
4712199 to understand a hopelessly destructive war inspired by the technologies of the internet but reaching far beyond its code and by understanding this battle it is an effort to map peace there is no good reason for the current struggle around the internet technologies to continue there will be great harm to our tradition and culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked we must come to understand the source of this war
4712200 interests most threatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised process of making law
4712201 cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon unfree or permission cultures leave much less ours was a free culture it is becoming much less so
4712202 the panic about privacy has all the finger pointing and paranoia of a good old american scare but its missing one vital ingredient a genuinely alarmed public
4712203 the amount of electronic products discarded globally has skyrocketed recently with 20 50 million tonnes generated every year electronic waste e waste now makes up five percent of all municipal solid waste worldwide nearly the same amount as all plastic packaging but it is much more hazardous not only developed countries generate e waste asia discards an estimated 12 million tons each year e waste is now the fastest growing component of the municipal solid waste stream because people are upgrading their mobile phones computers televisions audio equipment and printers more frequently than ever before mobile phones and computers are causing the biggest problem because they are replaced most often the average lifespan of computers in developed countries has dropped from six years in 1997 to just two years in 2005 mobile phones have a lifecycle of less than two years in developed countries in europe e waste is increasing at three to five percent a year almost three times faster than the total waste stream developing countries are also expected to triple their e waste production over the next five years
4712204 after 13 months of heavy use the lithium ion battery of the ipod can lose more than half of its functionality youll find that even though you recharge more often your ipod can fade out by the end of a long day simply put even though an ipod can cost you 350 these digital music players are designed to be disposable but battery decline is only one way that apple encourages speedy obsolescence another is by introducing spiffy new models shortly after youve acquired the latest thing decembers ipod looks a little duller since the introduction of the iphone doesnt it

4712206 resist or delay efforts to eliminate or substitute for hazardous materials and they are slow to design products for eventual ease of disassembly and recycling
4712207 government fails to hold manufacturers responsible for end of life management of their products
4712208 it is estimated that 10 of unwanted and obsolete computers are recycled riepe
4712209 most americans think theyre helping the earth when they recycle their old computers televisions and cell phones
4712210 uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal are causing environmental and health problems due to the methods of processing the waste workers in countries such as china india and nigeria then use hammers gas burners and their bare hands to extract metals glass and other recyclables exposing themselves and the environment to a cocktail of toxic chemicals
4712211 the epa is working with environmental groups recyclers and electronics manufacturers to develop a system to certify companies that recycle electronics responsibly but so far the various players have not agreed on standards and enforcement
4712212 if all of the 130 million cell phones retired annually in the united states were recycled approximately 3 9 metric tons of gold and 2 100 metric tons of copper could be recovered
4712213 many activists believe the answer lies in requiring electronics makers to take back and recycle their own products such laws would encourage manufacturers to make products that are easier to recycle and contain fewer dangerous chemicals
4712214 worldwide pc numbers will rise to hit 2 billion by 2015 with more than 1 billion of these in use by the end of next year
4712215 the average 24kg desktop computer with monitor requires at least 10 times its weight in fossil fuels and chemicals to manufacture much more materials intensive than an automobile or refrigerator which only require 1 2 times their weight in fossil fuels
4712216 the worlds first 100 biodegradable computer components have arrived from micropro a company based in dublin ireland who produces eco friendly computers keyboards mice and flat panel monitors
4712217 a pc may contain up to 4 g of gold and other valuable materials that can be recovered at a profit particularly if the work is done in low income countries
4712218 in 2004 more than 180 million personal computers pcs were sold worldwide in the same year an estimated 100 million obsolete pcs entered waste streams and were either recycled for the recovery of materials or finally disposed of
4712219 out of nearly 5 million pcs in 1 38 million are either model 486s thus some eight years old or even older re use is a good way to lengthen a products life span
4712220 due to the halogenated substances found in plastics both dioxins and furans are generated as a consequence of recycling metals from e waste halogenated substances contained in e waste particularly brominated flame retardants are of concern during the extrusion of plastics which is part of plastic recycling
4712221 since most e waste is shredded without proper disassembly hazardous substances such as pcb contained in capacitors may be dispersed into the recovered metals and the shredder waste
4712222 despite the technological advances in electronics manufacturing product recovery and recycling still remain cost time bottlenecks in this sector and industry needs to come up with environmentally friendly and economically justifiable recycling plans for their products to remain competitive
4712223 the unauthorized use manufacturing selling or distributing of copyrighted material without the consent of the owner

4712245 tens of millions of pets worldwide have been chipped in order to facilitate their identification at animal shelters it is estimated that in the united states alone 6000 animals were reunited with their owners due to their rfid tags every month in 2003
4712246 140 antennas that pick up signals and 35 rfid readers that interpret data
4712247 a persons name address and date and place of birth could easily be obtained by identity thieves
4712248 for instance the electronic communications privacy act which already outlaws wiretapping without proper consent could be amended to cover rfid technology
4712249 contrary to all principles of environmental justice the united states rather than banning the exports of toxic e waste to developing countries is actually facilitating their export
4712250 simply because they are claimed to be destined for recycling operations
4712251 500 container loads of second hand pcs and accessories enter nigeria through the lagos ports monthly with each container containing about 800 monitors or cpus
4712252 they break copper yokes off picture tubes littering the ground with shards containing lead a neurotoxin and cadmium a carcinogen that damages lungs and kidneys they strip resalable parts such as drives and memory chips then they rip out wiring and burn the plastic he sells copper stripped from one scrap load to buy another the key to making money is speed not safety
4712253 98 million cell phones were discarded in the united states in 2005 that same year 1 5 million to 1 9 million tons of computers tvs vcrs monitors cell phones and other equipment were discarded

4712255 no protection exposed to materials like lead mercury and brominated flame retardants that can cause intellectual impairment and damage to almost every organ and system in the human body including the brain nerves and bones
4712256 a lot of these materials are being sent to developing nations under the guise of reuse to bridge the digital divide
4712257 being discarded along rivers and roads often picked up by destitute scavengers who may face dangerous exposure to toxic chemicals in the broken equipment
4712258 it has been estimated that about 20 million computers enter the market every year in the us and 12 million computers are disposed of every year and out of those only about 10 of them are remanufactured or recycled
4712259 it is estimated that more than 70 of retired ceds are kept in storage for 3 5 years
4712260 nine states have passed producer responsibility laws requiring manufacturers to offer free e waste collection and recycling and 13 more are considering similar legislation
4712261 the energy intensive process added with the rapid rate at which they become obsolete leads to a growing mound of garbage contributing to resource depletion environmental pollution and climate change
4712262 more than 4 6 million tons of e waste entered us landfills in 2000 and that amount is projected to grow fourfold in the new few years
4712263 given that these companies sales numbers are off the charts they need to be taking some responsibility for the problem that they are indirectly creating by selling all this new stuff

4712277 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4712295 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4712296 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4712301 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4712302 barisan nasional is contesting as an underdog we will continue to work hard this will be an uphill task but it is not impossible
4712303 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament
4712304 nobody believes saiful his swearing in the mosque yesterday makes it more clear that its a government conspiracy to bring down anwar
4712305 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4712306 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4712307 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4712308 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4712309 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4712310 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4712311 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4712312 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4712313 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4712314 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4712315 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4712316 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4712317 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4712318 its sore every day its time to give him a break
4712319 each player is staying with a host family and theyre all very hospitable
4712320 at practice he says he wants everyone to hit line drives
4712321 its in his dna hes passing that on to the kids
4712322 they play hard they work hard its been an unbelievable summer
4712323 mr peters you have some beautiful animals here susan and i have talked and wed really like to buy the white one i know he is not for sale but he acts as if hes already mine he is so beautiful besides the alpha is too aggressive and the runt is too shy what do you say
4712324 no sale we are keeping the white to breed hes mine but i can see why youd want him id be glad to sell you one of the others i can tell youve done your research and are real dog lovers which is important for this breed but the white is mine and im just not going to sell him
4712325 if you should change your mind please call us first i have the strangest feeling that hes destined to be part of our family
4712326 thank you folks for coming by keep in touch ill be having another litter in four or five months
4712327 i just have a feeling for that white dog that i cant explain its like hes already mine and we know each other
4712328 he walked behind you and kept licking your face like you were his long lost friend
4712329 mr lee i talked it over with my wife while we want to keep the white were not blind we both saw the connection you have with that dog if youll come and get him hes yours

4712332 i cant believe it i went out so quick i knew it would be tough when i realised i was on my own i just went for it and felt i could get the time
4712333 when i looked up and saw her time it was just absolutely amazing its the world record always been a goal of mine its always been in the back of my head that i can do it
4712334 it means absolutely everything to me it just shows that the hard work has paid off how im going to cope with it get back in the pool and do more hard work
4712335 talent comes in different ways she has a psychological talent as well an inner strength she hates to lose and shes driven
4712336 she was nervous today but that was just her and her body getting ready for what she needed to do
4712337 some crack under pressure and a few get better shes one of those shes a winner
4712338 phelps swims spitz swims its right up there as one of the greatest because it was such an amazing record to break to break it and dominate that field by so much its right up there as one of the best
4712339 she works incredibly hard you can see shes a bubbly character but every session shes so driven and so focused and some of the training sets she does are just amazing
4712340 its not training like the old distance training not massive volume not 100k kms a week she does 65k a week
4712341 she only wanted you to go with someone so you could be safe

4712367 we balance the budget the way we run the club i have money available to buy
4712368 we go into the competition but the target is also to balance our budget which i think every manager should do
4712369 three or four years ago we went into a different policy that we have to be shrewd
4712370 i can make signings at very high prices but you have to have cohesion in the way you buy
4712371 manchester united are in the 20 30million bracket chelsea are in the unlimited bracket we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd
4712372 big signings reassure but good performances are much better we opted for stability with young players who have the spirit of our club
4712373 we always want to buy the right player at the right price but when you want to move a club forward like i did here in the last 10 years you also need investment not only for players
4712374 the quality of a manager is also to develop young players to spot them when they arent necessarily stars
4712375 if i had the choice to buy a player for 30million and win the title i would do it
4712376 forget it lah you wont make it unless you rape someone
4712377 probably a wallet will do or a coin pouch because a bag is more expensive
4712378 when david cameron arrives in georgia today he will be the first major british politician to visit the small democratic country being systematically trashed by the mighty russian bear some will accuse him of being an opportunist after all what can he do to help solve the conflict how many battalions does he command but at least the tory leader is taking a strong stand against increasing russian belligerence where on earth are gordon brown and his foreign secretary david miliband it was only after the tory leader had been on the airwaves on monday that mr brown issued a brief statement
4712379 the annual rent of one symbolic euro cannot be considered in the circumstances as a disguised subsidy the constitutional principal of la cit which implies the neutrality of the state and collective territories and equal treatment for all religions does not in itself rule out the granting in the general interest of certain types of assistance for activities or equipment connected to religions
4712380 we want to keep those guys as organized as we can we definitely dont want to overuse them usually when you get from this part of the season to the end guys are called upon to pitch more and you will use them more just because of the importance of where youre at in the standings and the importance of the game
4712381 so far i think weve done pretty good with that
4712382 its because of the games all the games have been one run games and its nip and tuck the whole way i think weve done a pretty good job with spreading it all out but its that time of year
4712383 fortunately weve got enough experience down there the guys have been through a 162 game schedule so theyre somewhat accustomed to it but at the same time wed like to get some one sided games so they can get some days off
4712384 unfortunately weve probably had to use chad a little too much at times
4712385 but with rudy seanez down you get into a situation with a bunch of righthanders up but we try to stretch it out as much as possible both ryan and chad have had some eighth inning stuff ideally wed like to use them in the seventh but theyre the guys that are going to have to get the eighth inning done for us but theyve been very solid for us
4712386 i just wanted to tell you how sorry i am for the crossfire my dad and i feel that you are the real winner
4712387 when the other one is competing it is very difficult to keep your mind on your own game
4712388 its been challenging to try to keep my head on straight for my events ive been so happy for her the story getting bigger back home i think thats fantastic
4712389 we have certain players and natashas one of them that give us energy in the locker room and on the field
4712390 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4712391 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4712392 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4712393 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance
4712394 at that point i didnt really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4712395 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4712396 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go

4712400 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4712401 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4712402 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4712403 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4712404 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4712413 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4712414 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4712415 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4712416 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4712417 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4712418 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4712419 getting into the hall of fame has allowed me to do some really cool things and this is one of them
4712420 they said no i said how can you not be nervous these are tougher kids i dont know
4712421 i guess ill take the silver it was a hard day for everybody
4712422 were so dominant to come in here and get spanked like this it makes you reflect we have a lot of work to do
4712423 if you would have told me that distance was going to win it this morning i would have said youre full of expletive
4712424 she was able to keep food inside both ways by wednesday
4712425 the environment was good the idea was good but it just didnt turn out
4712426 if i would have played last night it would not have been good
4712427 i would have hurt the team more than i would have helped lets put it that way but today its a full step in the right direction im not going to worry about it im at the point now where i can manage it and it will be ok
4712428 thats the bottom line im not going to be satisfied with any loss frankly im probably not going to be satisfied with any win either im always striving to get better
4712429 i thought our defense played pretty solid football but offensively we obviously had too many drops
4712430 you cant drop that many footballs in the game and expect to move the ball consistently we have to cut down on the penalties its good that theyre happening now so that we can get them corrected and worked on so that they dont happen during the season
4712431 it looked like he got a bit tired he banged up his leg and fell on his knee but he bounced back which was a good thing he was a little sore but he pulled himself back and worked his way through it and it worked out for him i thought he caught the ball ok he had a couple drops in there that we need to make sure we take care of
4712432 we all know the history of rookies playing here in philadelphia so you dont want to put too much pressure on jackson
4712433 im sure well have packages for him to be involved in
4712434 coach marty mornhinweg has a lot of things in the offense for me im just trying to do my best and get open as much as possible
4712435 kick returns punt returns interceptions theres just a certain feeling you get when you have the ball in your hands if im on the field long enough something is going to happen for me thats a proven fact
4712436 i should have got the sack but he threw it before i could get there
4712437 i put my hands up learning from brian dawkins he always puts his hands up i just put mine up and tipped the ball
4712438 ibamos a 8 minutos a cuatro minutos pelaos pero en el catorce jefferson ha cambiado muy fuerte
4712439 yo he intentado seguirle e ir cogi ndole progresivamente pero no pod a me he quedado clavado sin energ a que no enganchaba que no enganchaba y cuando no puedes no puedes ya me daba casi lo mismo ser sexto que octavo me he quedado bloqueado
4712440 han terminado a 7 30 y yo con borchin en la copa del mundo terminamos a 7 40 hoy no iba y hoy paquillo uno de los favoritos ha ca do no han ca do ni borchin ni jefferson que aunque no ha ganado ha sido medalla y alguna vez le toca la china a uno
4712441 decepcionante evidentemente cat strofico yo tengo una medalla ol mpica estoy triste pero tengo una medalla eso me consuela despu s de seis a os sin fallar me ha tocado en el momento clave en unos juegos ol mpicos
4712442 cada uno hace lo que quiere no ha venido el que ten a el r cord del mundo lo nico que s es que no estaba aqu y ha sido uno menos
4712443 ahora hay que asimilar esto porque igual que se asimilan los triunfos se asimilan las derrotas yo tambi n confiaba en m joder que hay un d a en que no te encuentras el primero que est jodido soy yo despu s mi equipo y los espa oles todo el mundo pensaba que iba a sacar medalla es normal yo tambi n lo pensaba
4712444 every time he gets a hit he tells me its the hair
4712445 it was just surprising to hear him say that nobody was close to soto
4712446 all i know is that hes healthy and he threw the ball well
4712447 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer was second
4712448 the difference was that one was stroking and one was gliding
4712449 i knew i would be in the lead after 50 meters
4712450 but i also knew michael phelps was a back half swimmer
4712451 the last eight meters i put my head down and i did not breathe
4712452 when i took that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race
4712453 it wasnt until i took the goggles off and saw the 1 next to my name that i was sure id won
4712454 and i came within 0 01 of a second of beating michael phelps getting a gold im very happy
4712455 i think i need to go home and stay dry for a while
4712456 if you were there you would have seen i was firing above him at my manager i have nothing against michael phelps hes the king do i want to make a rivalry of this sure why not but ive never disrespected anyone im not going to start with michael phelps
4712457 it hadnt been my best season but i saved my best performance for the games
4712458 it is just another race and i like to think of it that way
4712459 but its also way bigger than i thought it would be
4712460 if it doesnt i think well be ok since they have played together in years past if i had my choice id much rather have them do that
4712461 we all want to win the race for him but if the horse races well my dad if he was here would be the first person to be happy and not complain
4712462 he would be disappointed but as long as the horse raced well and came back sound it was a successful day
4712463 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4712464 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4712465 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4712466 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4712467 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4712468 i saw 37 dead civilians near arbiska where the ethiopian forces indiscriminately opened fire on two civilian buses
4712469 its a scene of complete destruction of human life everyone is dazed
4712470 they killed everyone on the buses there was blood everywhere it was unbearable to look at the scene
4712471 the ethiopian forces opened fire on the two civilian buses and they killed many i personally counted 15 just in one spot but i could not reach some of the other places where people are saying many others were killed
4712472 most of them are in shock but they explained that many civilians were indiscriminately killed
4712473 we have collected most of the bodies and they were identified by their relatives
4712474 it was the worst incident that happened in one place
4712475 the first thing steve and i do every morning once we have the coffee made
4712476 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place
4712477 the next best thing to sitting with a friend over a cappucino

4712486 im here making a bit of money on the side
4712487 they picked on the foreigners and there are not that many of us left
4712488 but im thinking of leaving the beijing olympics the police are getting a bit annoying
4712489 they will be held for a day or two and then released they will probably be back here on monday
4712490 i am touched by the support this is an overwhelming support
4712491 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4712492 barisan nasional is contesting as an underdog we will continue to work hard this will be an uphill task but it is not impossible
4712493 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament
4712494 nobody believes saiful his swearing in the mosque yesterday makes it more clear that its a government conspiracy to bring down anwar

4712553 the commission believes that growth and job creation must be a primary focus for any recommended changes to the existing tax structure
4712554 making the system more fair and equitable for our taxpayers

4712595 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
4712596 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
4712597 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
4712598 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
4712599 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
4712600 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic

4712616 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
4712617 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds

4712623 we hope that it will be bigger and better than last year
4712624 weve had more interest from out of town vendors this year
4712625 there will be things to do for all ages including a climbing wall which is new this year
4712626 it is a community event focused on outreach to the public
4712627 as its getting closer things have been getting more hectic
4712628 we went right through this thing this team was very focused very determined they werent going to do anything to get in the way of this championship
4712629 our team wanted it more than any team in this tournament
4712630 i always knew that when you need to take it up to the next level we had the right players
4712631 its not about how you start its how you finish
4712632 when you get in the playoffs a different mentality comes with a competitive baseball player
4712633 and this team has a whole bunch of them and it worked out in our benefit
4712634 i rescheduled a number of witnesses today to minimize that possibility
4712635 the word was passed on the street that our witness had identified ricardo juarez
4712636 the concern for the integrity of what goes on in the courtroom is a valid concern but the danger of expressing that concern to the wrong audience is it might have an impact on jurors or forthcoming witnesses

4712638 it looked like a bat i saw him get stabbed i saw things getting thrown i will never forget that day
4712639 this is the first time ive seen a board this close
4712640 i thought they would be like a skateboard or something theyre big
4712641 back in san antonio i do wheelchair basketball handcycling scuba diving six months ago when i wasnt in a wheelchair i wouldnt have tried this but im in a wheelchair what can i lose
4712642 its the least we can do for these guys who gave so much for our country
4712643 thats my goal to give them a little of the stoke that we experience every day to pass that along to the soldiers so they can go on and meet their goals not necessarily to make surfers out of them
4712644 the first or second time i was able to stand up
4712645 whatever is going on at home at the house is all left behind
4712646 most of us have been working out already but it takes a lot of strength to get up on the board its really tiring
4712647 ive taught a lot of people to surf and its hard to get some of them to even paddle out these guys are just going for it
4712648 their determination and the attitude they hold is like no one else theyre another caliber of people thats for sure
4712649 but we have two donors willing to commit to make this happen
4712650 the ultimate goal of the project is for the school to be a long sustaining facility for the district
4712651 it will really be something the community can be proud of
4712652 were a long way from it but at the same time were developing plans
4712653 were trying to do our part but theres other forces beyond our control
4712654 we will be on this fire until it is dead out
4712655 i felt like you could pick up a rock and throw it at it
4712656 i wanted to stay and fight for my home as long as i possibly could
4712657 many of us live here and enjoy living here because of the small town feel
4712658 its not a small town anymore but theres a small town feel
4712659 a lot of them would grab the pen out of my hands
4712660 news press radio 1290 kzsb had a 1 4 share of the audience

4712662 i was really close to her i talked to her almost every day
4712663 checks were bouncing but all the calls she was taking them the bank was calling but she was the one answering the phone mail statements were coming in but she got the mail
4712664 thats a pretty common procedure in cases where theres a large amount of money stolen
4712665 normally its a five year wait for this kind of event
4712666 but one of my assistant scoutmasters was a classmate of greg at cal poly they kept in touch and anticipated doing this

4712670 we feel very very strongly that the charm and the character of santa barbara are in danger
4712671 were in danger of losing those qualities because of big buildings
4712672 im saddened by the fact that they felt like they needed to continue with this overly simplistic measure
4712673 i dont think it will be in the best long term interest of the citizens of santa barbara to pass it but i do understand there is a legitimate concern about size bulk and scale
4712674 the issue of size bulk scale and affordable housing cannot all be addressed by height
4712675 it came into my heart that each one of those signatures is like a sacred trust and we couldnt just throw them away
4712676 i think its fine for the city council to put out an alternative initiative if it wants to the people then could make the choice this is all about the people making the choice
4712677 this is a place where everyone wants to come and live
4712678 and you build these buildings it brings more people here people compete for the buildings they cant be affordable unless youre price restricting them you just get more people paying more money and more units and more population
4712679 this is one of the few ways the general public can actually have a voice in the planning process
4712680 the planning process has become so professionalized that sometimes it gets alienated from the people

4712689 every hr manager seems to be reducing recruitment costs and the easiest way to do this is by bringing down the role of or by doing away with consultants
4712690 we are relying more on low cost high efficiency methods of recruitment including employee referrals
4712691 recruitments through referrals sites portals etc come 20 cheaper than through consultants
4712692 now the figure of recruits through consultants stands at 30
4712693 this is so as the trust levels are higher and you get a known product the employee who is referring someone knows the capabilities of that person
4712694 especially when recruiting people at senior levels companies need to rely on consultants as they have a professional approach and huge network bases
4712695 but as an ongoing recruitment process we hire through other methods

4712721 when a person serving a sentence in a prison on the order of a court suddenly ends up being commander of an armed group not to mention a group of servicemen of the defense ministry of the russian federation this at minimum raises questions
4712722 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4712723 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4712724 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4712725 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that

4712942 we continue to have record months of fundraising this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before
4712943 which gives us plenty enough money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4712944 blt itu harus dilihat dulu konsepnya ini kompensasi dari kenaikan bbm ketika bbm naik otomatis warga miskin meningkat
4712945 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4712946 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4712947 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4712948 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4712949 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4712950 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4712951 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4712952 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4712953 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4712954 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4712957 i would never hurt anyone but none of that matters now
4712958 defendemos el proceso de ingreso a la carrera docente mediante un examen nosotros no podemos ver ning n maestro que entre a las aulas por primera vez que no sea por la v a de un concurso
4712959 los docentes padecen rezagos serios en cuanto a dominio de los contenidos de asignaturas b sicas problemas en el manejo de los enfoques pedag gicos y en consecuencia dificultades para el dise o de estrategias de ense anza relevantes para el logro de aprendizajes
4712960 se suman las nuevas problem ticas escaso manejo de recursos tecnol gicos de la computaci n e internet tanto para uso personal como educativo y poco entrenamiento en manejo de situaciones escolares derivadas de la problem tica social contempor nea
4712961 nosotros estamos obedeciendo totalmente la convocatoria y esperamos que se va a respetar por eso es porque se estableci este comit
4712962 conocer los trabajos y la forma en que se realiza un proceso como ste esperamos transparencia e igualdad a la hora de evaluar
4712963 aqu en la entidad todo se est haciendo con transparencia y de acuerdo a los lineamientos de la sep
4712964 uno es para los maestros que no tienen ninguna plaza y la otra es para los maestros que son interinos aunque finalmente tendr amos que sujetarnos a los propios acuerdos que la comisi n nacional acordara
4712965 estamos observando el proceso y la transparencia de este mecanismo de trabajo
4712966 tenemos que detectar todos los casos para ver cu les son casos que s se justifican legalmente para que no les quiten su trabajo hay otros que no se justifican cada caso es diferente y se tienen que ver de manera individual
4712967 tenemos que hablar con cada uno de ellos para ver cu l es el caso y cuando haya justificaci n entrar a la defensa del profesor
4712968 esto va en dem rito del servicio educativo pero la revisi n la har n los responsables del rea de conflicto de las secciones con la secretar a de educaci n nombre por nombre
4712969 ellos quedan un poco maniatados porque no tienen la formaci n de docentes la convocatoria limit a muchos por el candado que present la propia instituci n pero en esos casos como ya es algo que el trabajador ya ten a tenemos que negociarlo con secretar a
4712970 estamos revisando a nivel nacional con la comisi n rectora cu l es el n mero de vacantes que hay en el caso de las plazas de los maestros que van a ingresar al servicio se va a dar la mitad de las plazas y para los interinos la otra mitad
4712971 no la asignaci n de plazas porque la mayor a se las guard elba esther gordillo l der del sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la educaci n y sus caciques sino el mapa de su impunidad y corrupci n ante el creciente descr dito que acumula en la base magisterial
4712972 no s lo es mera simulaci n sino un term metro del enorme repudio que generan las iniciativas de gordillo y su pandilla porque no s lo en michoac n oaxaca zacatecas coahuila y guerrero enfrent enorme resistencia en todo el pa s disminuy la presencia de aspirantes pues hubo escuelas donde no acudi ni la mitad de los inscritos
4712973 no cumpl an los requisitos los cuales ni siquiera se dieron a conocer en la convocatoria estatal lo que gener falsas expectativas y enojo
4712974 nunca aceptar como sus dirigentes a quienes por casi 20 a os han tenido sumidos en el abandono los derechos laborales de los maestros y han impulsado reformas para acabar con la escuela p blica y laica
4712975 resulta parad jico pues cuando m s profesores requiere el sistema para cubrir las aulas menos espacios se reconocen oficialmente
4712976 prevalece gran desconfianza sobre los organizadores de dicho concurso y los mecanismos empleados para su aplicaci n y evaluaci n al elegir a una organizaci n civil a modo para que certifique el proceso sino tambi n porque en los hechos se quieren lavar las manos y cerrar de manera definitiva la posibilidad de ingreso al servicio docente a los miles de egresados de normales e instituciones p blicas de educaci n superior
4712977 no s lo incumple las condiciones m nimas de transparencia exigidas en cualquier pr ctica de evaluaci n educativa que debe estar a cargo de organismos independientes se trata de un examen at pico que va en contra de los principios rectores de un ejercicio similar en cualquier parte del mundo pues no se garantiz la completa autonom a de un comit de verdaderos expertos ajenos a los intereses de las partes
4712978 apenas est n presentando un programa educativo y adem s no plantea la gran soluci n la cual no es aplicar ex menes
4712979 c mo se puede tener a dos se oras jal ndose del chongo en la sep ah hay dos secretarias y sobra alguna
4712980 defender los derechos de sus agremiados pero no tiene atributos de autoridad ni administrativos y si se convierte en autoridad echamos a perder todo
4712981 y si contamos seis a os con fox y dos del actual gobierno es lo que llevamos de vivir un desastre educativo social de salud en todo la nica soluci n es que felipe calder n se vaya con todo su
4712982 opaco y discrecional no s lo asistimos a una simulaci n sino tambi n a la ruptura de un mecanismo de vinculaci n entre los egresados de escuelas normales y universidades p blicas con el espacio directo para ejercer la docencia que es la escuela al destacar que se tienen muy pocas posibilidades de ingreso y con ello a la absorci n de una oferta de docentes que ya no podr n llegar a las aulas
4712983 la convocatoria s lo incluye la programaci n detallada que emerge del presupuesto de egresos de la federaci n 2008 toda la vacancia de los estados la que es parte de la plantilla ordinaria y que queda libre o puede quedar libre de manera temporal hasta donde he visto nadie la ha puesto
4712984 se da un pacto unilateral y obviamente estamos frente a un problema de verdad que es el hecho de que la implementaci n de la alianza s nos necesita a los estados pero si vamos a ser empleado o simples pagadores de sus proyectos y programas indudablemente esto va a tener poco xito
4712985 si mi estimaci n es correcta la mitad de las plazas no se estar an renovando por la v a del concurso
4712986 si la tasa de renovaci n del sistema educativo es del 4 por ciento de los 970 mil maestros de escuelas p blicas significa como 40 mil plazas entre vacantes por diferentes motivos y de nueva creaci n
4712987 quiere decir que los sistemas estatales no est n poniendo sus plazas por eso ser a muy conveniente que la alianza diera a conocer cu ntas plazas vacantes se dan al a o por entidad porque las 25 mil plazas anunciadas representa tan s lo 2 por ciento del total
4712988 hay una decisi n fundamental que tomamos el s bado con el sindicato se acord que a partir del examen todas las plazas que se van a proponer en la secretar a todas ser n bajo el examen de oposici n
4712989 los que no puedan ser contratados en este periodo normalmente los maestros su prejubilatorio lo presentan en octubre pero ya tendremos presentado el examen por los alumnos y yo espero un promedio de 300 jubilaciones en octubre y ah podremos colocar a varios de los aspirantes que no encontraran espacio este d a
4712990 la etapa en la que entraremos a partir del pr ximo lunes extender estos operativos a todo el territorio nacional a todas las entidades federativas y nuevamente habr una participaci n conjunta de la profeco y de la sep esta vez con el respaldo de los gobiernos estatales
4712991 a o de la educaci n f sica y el deporte
4712992 se trata de que los ni os puedan hacer ejercicio orientados por su maestro y de ser posible un mentor especializado incluso agreg en aquellas escuelas donde no haya espacio suficiente para hacer deporte por lo menos que el propio sal n de clases sirva para ello
4712993 la actividad f sica y el deporte nos ayudan a fomentar el valor del respeto
4712994 seguramente quienes no creen que este proceso va en serio m s tarde reconocer n que estamos cumpliendo
4712995 hay quienes no conf an hay esc pticos y seguramente quienes no creen que este proceso va en serio m s tarde reconozcan que estamos cumpliendo
4712996 no tenemos reportado ning n incidente mayor que ponga en riesgo la credibilidad de los resultados que ser n dados a conocer el pr ximo jueves por la comisi n rectora una vez que concluya la recepci n de las cajas con los ex menes y las hojas de respuestas de los aspirantes
4712997 la organizaci n transparencia mexicana acredit a 203 observadores que estuvieron presentes en la mayor a de las sedes mientras que en el resto hubo representantes del snte de las secretar as de educaci n estatales y de la sep
4712998 no se mandaron ex menes adicionales precisamente para no tener incertidumbre de quien podr a llenar estos ex menes
4712999 en general no tuvimos incidentes mayores s lo se registraron retrasos en algunas sedes en la hora de inicio o en la hora de t rmino de los ex menes que se retrasaron algunos minutos pero que no pusieron en riesgo la credibilidad del examen lo importante es que el examen se desarroll pr cticamente de manera simult nea
4713000 esto ocurri en baja california que tiene dos horas de diferencia son casos que la comisi n rectora estar analizando en funci n de las actas y de los casos espec ficos para tomar las resoluciones correspondientes

4713005 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
4713006 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
4713007 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
4713008 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
4713009 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
4713010 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum
4713011 finas cornel marculescu said it was a matter of policy and that the serbian team was satisfied with the ruling after seeing the images so there is no need to share the images
4713012 asked why fina wouldnt distribute the footage if it showed the margin conclusively
4713013 puedo mirar a los ojos a cualquiera de los que estamos aqu y a muchos que les falta venirse aludi a quienes apoyan la creaci n del sindicato estatal de trabajadores de la educaci n promovido por su adversario h ctor manuel lara moreno quien fue suspendido en sus derechos en la secci n 37 y enfrenta una demanda por malversaci n de los dineros a su cargo en el fondo mutualista de retiro podemos saludarlos con atenci n con respeto con dignidad
4713014 ahora estamos atravesando por una crisis que vamos remendando poco a poco me da mucho gusto que en esta reuni n que fortalecemos a trav s de nuestro delegado especial nos encontremos con compa eros muy valiosos como juan miguel villalobos hilda pacheco le n mar a luisa guti rrez santoyo rodolfo l pez huerta los coordinadores regionales de otras regiones y que estemos haciendo un trabajo combativo con un mismo objetivo construir al fin y al cabo aqu nos podemos poner de acuerdo pero atr s de nosotros est un gran compromiso los compa eros en las escuelas
4713015 una crisis que claro que nos duele se aprende con el ejemplo el ejemplo que nuestros padres nos dan con su trabajo entrega y dedicaci n a todo lo que hacen el trabajo que nuestros maestros nos encomendaron
4713016 c mo nos hacen falta los valores la comunicaci n la verdad la dedicaci n la sinceridad esa es la gran tarea y el gran reto que tenemos no tan s lo lo sindical y buscar posiciones que es hermoso servir al sindicato pero tambi n tenemos un gran reto que es educar
4713017 por eso voltean todav a los padres de familia a vernos con respeto pero no defraudemos esa esperanza que a n hay en que los maestros construyamos una educaci n para servir a una sociedad
4713018 vamos dando el paso y pong monos de acuerdo para contrarrestar lo que tanta falta nos hace la unidad en la secci n 37
4713019 como bien lo dijo el delegado especial aqu cabemos todos el que entienda ese mensaje vamos poni ndonos de acuerdo si aqu va a estar el delegado que bueno con su orientaci n y si no va a ser que bueno que nos podamos poner de acuerdo m s adelante
4713020 en ese trabajo en la responsabilidad que cada uno tiene en lo laboral social econ mico que finalmente todo repercute en lo pol tico tenemos una tarea que hacer si no entregamos todo nuestro potencial y el extra que nos quede esta secci n va a seguir as dormida
4713021 hay cosas que el tiempo juzgar dimensionar y pondr a cada quien en su lugar pero hay cosas que no podemos olvidar tenemos que hacer el esfuerzo de seguir caminando sin perder los objetivos servir a la educaci n y a la sociedad
4713022 los que coincidan con este ideal y quieran dar toda su fuerza de voluntad para sacar adelante a la secci n 37 que bueno que coincidamos en ese principio
4713023 ser a f cil presa de los lobos de mar
4713024 i think it does mean more along with the twenty20 finals day its the biggest day of the year
4713025 i dont think many of our side have played in a lords final the last time kent reached one i wasnt on the staff its quite a special time to be involved
4713026 i think it will help come saturday in finals people have to raise their game thats what the big occasions are all about we have done that in the last two twenty20 finals days so hopefully we can do it again
4713027 we started poorly on paper we knew we were a good side so it was a bit worrying i think justin kemps innings against sussex which got us home for our first win was a big moment and then we went straight to the oval and beat surrey thats when we started to believe how good we were
4713028 no matter how good the team is you do lose confidence with defeats but justin kemp turned it round pretty quickly for us
4713029 we have been very lucky with the signings we have made in azhar mahmood and justin kemp and the rest of the team have just kept on improving which is what you always try to do
4713030 joe denly has come in over the last couple of years and been fantastic and martin van jaarsveld is having as good a year as anyone
4713031 a lot of people remember the sides which win the championship but in one day cricket we have been superb james tredwell simon cook everyone at some stage has done something to get us to the final we have a decent formula and it has worked
4713032 between my study and november 5 2007 when it was taken off the market there were approximately 431 000 patients who received the drug
4713033 as i calculated 22 000 lives could have been saved its about a 1 000 lives saved per month delay in taking that drug off the market
4713034 prosecutors interviewed chen on friday regarding the swiss bank accounts
4713035 we have notified them to return to taiwan as soon as possible for the investigation through the former president
4713036 the process used in paid voter registration drives is rife with opportunity for fraud
4713037 to ensure that election laws are being followed all of the applications should be scrutinized
4713038 i am committed to having the fairest and best run elections in the country here and what youre seeing is an example of that
4713039 you have a small number of individuals here who are making up applications to make their quota they really dont understand the severity of what theyre doing they really make all the rest look bad

4713141 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4713142 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4713143 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4713144 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4713145 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4713146 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4713147 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4713148 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4713149 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4713150 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4713151 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4713152 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation

4713162 desde mi punto de vista el hecho de que se convoque a un consejo nacional en donde se pretenda o se plantee tomar decisiones de gran alcance si esto es as pues entonces es una cumbre consecuentemente su servidor asistir a a la reuni n del consejo nacional de seguridad la semana entrante
4713163 lo apoyamos aqu como lo apoyamos tambi n decididamente a nombre del pueblo y el gobierno de veracruz en sus esfuerzos por combatir la inseguridad para hacer cumplir la ley y para hacer que la convivencia con el respeto al derecho sea el signo de vida de todos los mexicanos sobre todo de los veracruzanos

4713175 were cleaning out the basement holcim provide some good employees to come out and help me get this basement gutted because everything that water was over the main floor and everything down there is shot
4713176 whatever reason or purpose you have for going in the water there is swimwear that you can feel good in and that will suit your needs including mastectomy swimwear regardless of your size your age or your activity there will be a swimsuit that provides the comfort and coverage you need
4713177 it is becoming more and more important that all sun lovers take precautions to avoid excessive exposure to the suns harmful rays following are some tips to make your sun worshipping both enjoyable and safer
4713178 im very concerned about that and ill be asking a lot of questions internally to find out whats going on
4713179 i was collecting between 1000 and 3000 litres of water a day that was constantly
4713180 it was just a big soggy hole there were even water plants starting to grow even water dragons moved into my yard because of the water
4713181 my stumps are gone my slabs all cracking underneath the same as next door the waters just undermined it

4713184 there are so many styles of swimwear to choose from especially if you are a women with more options than ever all women regardless of size or shape can feel stylish wearing swimwear at the pool or on the beach this season
4713185 they stop mining just long enough to erect the tunnel segments
4713186 i went berserk at that moment because i couldnt believe what had occurred
4713187 there arent really enough train drivers to fuel our expansion in coming years
4713188 theres a fair bit of hands on work required its not set and forget
4713189 ronnie is making good progress in his battle with booze
4713190 his family hoped his fling with eka happened because he fell off the wagon
4713191 sadly for them he has genuinely fallen head over heels for her
4713192 hes like a lovesick puppy and cant shake off his teenage like infatuation jos moving to the us to piece her life back together
4713193 being away from memories of ron will do her good
4713194 it new delhis view is not suggested it is clearly said that the isi is fermenting trouble in kashmir they have been fermenting trouble in kashmir for years again you have a situation where part of it is outside particularly from pakistan and the other side has been doing so for decades not just the past few weeks
4713195 similarly there is evidence that the isi has been active on the afghanistan border recently there were accusations about the isi involvement in the kabul indian embassy attack on july 7 i mean these are just tip of the iceberg its interesting now its not the isi that is possibly doing something new its the fact that the international community accepts its and can say it publicly and thats the major difference not the action themselves
4713196 the question is very bizarre to start with in a sense that political instability is already there but i mean dont forget that pervez musharraf himself is part of this political instability by staying on he clearly ignored the result of the february 2008 election and therefore creating frustration in the population so his departure is likely to lessen the tension not increase it
4713197 to an extent it is true that musharraf had at least contributed to the significant improvement of relations between the two and for a long time there is a new perception that his departure would be a problem for that very reason at the same time this is not the impeachment of musharraf or the beginning of the process which has started the deterioration of relations with india
4713198 what we have seen since the beginning of the summer resumption of the situation on the attack of all kind in a sense including their embassy in afghanistan so the deterioration was there anyway it would not be changed by the impeachment process itself
4713199 this is the last bastion of cottage affordability in the province

4713210 the ministry of the environment has received no assurances that the work will be done in a timely way
4713211 the city has cleanup powers under the environmental protection act so to ensure that the area is cleaned up as soon as possible the city working with the ministry of the environment will start its own cleanup of the residential area today
4713212 given that theres the investigation and the obvious impact of the explosion its fairly obvious to anyone that thats not going to take place
4713213 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4713214 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4713215 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4713216 people are coming out of the woodwork crying sending me letters and flowers telling me no i cant do it im a toronto institution
4713217 but if i dont go now ill be an institution or rather ill be in one
4713218 its very upsetting to see it go i dont think there will be another shop like it
4713219 she knew that irish women were second to none where the weaving dying and knitting of fabric was concerned
4713220 she convinced me to get the women creating sweaters for import i supplied them the yarn and then paid them by the weight of the sweaters the heavier the better
4713221 knowing that i fulfilled my mothers wish for her people

4713224 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4713225 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4713226 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4713227 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4713228 i believe these cornerstone online gaming economy works to be of great interest to the public and of high educational value
4713229 and i hereby order them set into the public domain for all to benefit
4713230 we all agreed that these items are best left open for all in the long haul we really would not have made that much money on licensing them anyway and this way students and historians in the online gaming economy field can use them for further research and studies
4713231 this is a great moment in the history of the spunt dutrow memorial libary and trust we finally have some authentic documents to add to our collection on the development of the online gaming economy economy and industry but also have the ability to share them with the rest of the world and anyone who has a strong interest in learning more about online gaming economy
4713232 were all please by these recent developments and cant wait until nyhus cortis online gaming economy llc the selected restoration firm gets to work putting these papers into digital form
4713233 and once this is done we can begin searching through them for various hidden online gaming economy gems
4713234 im thrilled about finding these long lost online gaming economy documents with the letters notes and works from the once defunct alguire corkill memorial library we can really get a better grasp on the online gaming economy network that proceeded its modern day equivalent

4713245 sepertinya asumsi pemerintah rupiah di level 9 100 cukup realistis sebab selama pemerintahan sby jk rupiah memang tidak pernah menyentuh level di bawah 9 000
4713246 selain gejolak ekonomi global penguatan dolar as terhadap seluruh mata uang dunia juga akan mempengaruhi posisi rupiah tahun depan
4713247 itulah sebabnya mengapa dolar as mengalami penguatan terhadap seluruh mata uang dunia akhir akhir ini padahal belum lama kita mendengar isu tentang resesi ekonomi as hal ini menunjukkan spekulan spekulan itu melihat dolar as lebih menarik daripada komoditas meskipun ekonomi as sedang guncang
4713248 sebagaimana kita ketahui setiap pemilu itu selalu beredar uang politik baik itu uang palsu maupun uang partai ini akan berpengaruh pada nilai tukar rupiah
4713249 tentu ini bisa membuat rupiah menguat namun karena kondisi global sedang tidak menentu sepertinya akan terjadi tarik menarik nilai tukar rupiah akibat kondisi global sebagai faktor luar dan pemilu sebagai faktor dalam negeri

4713254 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4713255 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4713256 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4713257 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4713258 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4713259 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4713260 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4713261 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4713262 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4713263 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4713264 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4713265 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4713266 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4713267 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4713268 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4713269 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4713270 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4713271 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4713272 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4713273 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4713274 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4713275 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4713276 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4713277 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4713278 indian identities in the rainbow nation responses to transformation in south african schools

4713280 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4713281 if sen mccain chooses a pro abortion vice president he will give the election to obama there would no longer be a sharp distinction between pro life and the lack of life it would be tantamount to political suicide
4713282 that is comforting to those of us for whom that is an important issue
4713283 a lot of it depends on how this debate begins to evolve over the next couple of months leading into november
4713284 i do believe that there is a very clear contrast when one candidate takes a solid pro life position and the other takes a position that is anything but
4713285 reluctance to talk about his record on those issues is keeping him from having a clearly drawn distinction with obama and that is where i think a running mate helps him out
4713286 the same problem has appeared when using a different screen saver from the ones apple provides on the computer

4713301 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4713302 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4713303 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4713304 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4713305 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4713306 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4713307 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4713308 pornography for us is whatever gets the sex offender in trouble and that photo happened to be of a 15 year old
4713309 the offenders will know that were able to go in and search the computer
4713310 maybe itll help them monitor their behavior because its important for a sex offender in treatment to know how to self regulate
4713311 this is part of our ongoing efforts to help protect children on the internet keeping sex offenders off social sites is a critical step to keeping our kids safe online
4713312 frequently those who are trying to entice the child are not using their real name they are not using accurate information in their profile so it takes some effort usually to track it down to the responsible person
4713313 since the creation of mankind until the advent of doomsday no fitnah damage will be greater than that of the dajjals anti christ
4713314 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4713315 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4713316 the key is whether the legislature has the right to inform the public of sex offenders living in the community
4713317 the intent of the legislature was not to provide punishment but to provide a civil remedial action
4713318 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4713319 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4713320 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4713321 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4713322 based on the unanimous passage of this legislation through both chambers of the nevada legislature it would be hard to assume anyone foresaw the constitutional challenges the law is currently facing
4713323 still governor gibbons would much rather sign aggressive laws protecting the people of nevada from sexual predators than wait to see how other states handle federal legislation and see whether the courts agree with it
4713324 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4713325 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4713326 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4713327 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4713328 i have done everything i can to comply with the law and be a good citizen i would never hurt anyone but none of that matters now
4713329 i roll with anything my demise could have come then so i savor every moment now
4713330 look the situation was forced on me and i did my job when people tell me im a hero i dont say anything a requirement of the program was to act the part if people saw us as heroes that was good we werent about to say hey flying to the moon is easy just follow the checklist
4713331 grit and grace under pressure that is the province of true heroes
4713332 for years nasa didnt want to talk about it failures arent what you use to get more appropriations
4713333 apollo 13 has another unique place in space history its actually more memorable this way
4713334 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4713335 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4713336 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4713337 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4713338 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4713339 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4713340 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4713341 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4713342 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4713343 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4713344 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4713345 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4713346 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4713347 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4713348 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4713349 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4713350 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4713351 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4713352 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4713353 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4713354 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4713355 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4713356 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4713357 their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and lay the foundations for measures that are needed to counteract such change
4713358 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4713359 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4713360 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4713361 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4713362 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4713363 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4713364 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4713365 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4713366 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4713367 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4713368 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4713369 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4713370 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4713371 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4713372 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4713373 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4713374 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4713375 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4713376 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4713377 what do you want your look to say to people
4713378 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4713379 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4713380 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4713381 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4713382 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4713383 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4713384 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4713385 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4713386 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country

4713392 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season
4713393 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4713394 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4713395 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season
4713396 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different
4713397 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4713398 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4713399 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4713400 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4713401 and thats why you should never eat movie theater hot dogs
4713402 and because it was legally art they dropped the charges
4713403 and thats why i am no longer welcome in turkey
4713404 and ive been out of prison for 2 years and i still like to do it
4713405 of course we had to sell the donkey before we left tijuana
4713406 and so my childhood best friend will soon be my step son
4713407 so we were disqualified from the iditarod because they werent technically dogs
4713408 and i still have it in a jar of formaldehyde in my closet
4713409 and now the security at disneyland has the legal right to shoot me on sight
4713410 there were so many players who stepped in and played really hard in our game against canada were getting some momentum now we lost our first game but weve played well ever since hopefully that momentum will carry on through to the semi finals
4713411 i roll with anything my demise could have come then so i savor every moment now
4713412 grit and grace under pressure that is the province of true heroes
4713413 for years nasa didnt want to talk about it failures arent what you use to get more appropriations
4713414 apollo 13 has another unique place in space history its actually more memorable this way
4713415 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4713416 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4713417 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4713418 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4713419 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4713420 det er meget trist vi risikerer ikke kun at f udhulet vores udl ndingepolitik men integrationsloven kan vi heller ikke bruge
4713421 det er helt afg rende at der foreg r en integration ellers falder danmark fra hinanden
4713422 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4713423 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4713424 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4713425 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4713426 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4713427 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4713428 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4713429 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4713430 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4713431 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4713432 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4713433 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4713434 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4713435 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4713436 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4713437 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4713438 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4713439 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4713440 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4713441 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4713442 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4713443 this is not a get out of jail free card
4713444 if a project could affect the black footed ferret there still has to be a consultation with federal scientists
4713445 it would have been a very lengthy and drawn out process even though we believe we would have been successful
4713446 ray has long been the unsung hero at the utah attorney generals office
4713447 he has quietly handled some of our most difficult assignments with diplomacy and skill
4713448 my impression was the west side mayors did not endorse it as something we should adopt
4713449 that kind of disparity is what led to the concerns of the east side
4713450 it is a pleasure to welcome dr el saidi to our uvu family
4713451 he brings a wealth of experience in higher education from a number of institutions across the nation we look forward to utilizing his considerable expertise in assessment and data analysis in particular
4713452 hvis fagbev gelsen ikke internt kan blive enige om grundl ggende forhold s gambler de med neds ttelsen af en l nkommission
4713453 det er n dvendigt at vi og arbejdsgiverne sidder med i kommissionen hvis der skal blive enighed om noget der forpligter hvis vi holder kommissionen ud i arms l ngde s er der en stor risiko for at der slet ikke kommer noget ud af arbejdet
4713454 alle vil blot forts tte med at forf lge deres interesser overenskomstslagsm let vil bare forts tte i kommissionen vi kan ende med at sidde og dynge papir i hovedet p hinanden og f en kommission der sl r pet kommissionens rekord i tidsforbrug
4713455 qwest and comcast said its a huge issue no one knew the fiscal impact
4713456 i left the bill to die so that further research could be done
4713457 the main governing body for switch circuit phone service does not consider us in the same category
4713458 we both provide two way communications across county lines and that similarity drives our request
4713459 the implication is that centrally assessed is going to cost comcast some money and taxes get passed on to the customer
4713460 people that are poor would bear the brunt of that
4713461 simply put if there is to be a structural change it must come through the legislative process and not administrative actions
4713462 thank you for your prayers donations your love to the hospitals emts sheriffs offices highway patrol mine rescue mayors hilary gordon and joe piccolo please know you are loved and we are thankful that you pulled us through
4713463 i have never seen the community come together to provide hope and support the way it did last year
4713464 it makes me feel good because they care about my husband and those other guys
4713465 do you realize what direction the balloons were going toward crandall
4713466 heard loud deep rumbling from continued movement of the surrounding strata and observed sloughing of the walls and mine roof
4713467 conscious and lying against the left rib entangled in chain link fencing
4713468 muffled voice calling for help bouldin asked day where he was day replied that bouldin was standing on him bouldin looked down and saw part of days shoulder exposed through the rubble and his head buried beneath large pieces of coal
4713469 we need lots of shovels and picks we cant get them unburied
4713470 we dont have to this is an off leash park
4713471 were being pretty tight lipped about the entire operation because we dont really know what to expect
4713472 they would have you believe theyre clubs but theyre not theyre involved in criminal enterprise
4713473 theyve been actively recruiting and their presence has grown in utah over the last few years
4713474 its not going to be a gestapo like presence theyll be in the shadows
4713475 they call it going to church its been in my experience that sometimes at church they plan criminal business
4713476 were not 100 percent sure but we do believe this is ms nichi edwards
4713477 were asking these state agencies to monitor the situation within their en forcement powers to make sure utahns are not being taken advantage of
4713478 i hated to decline because i love their work but i just couldnt whore myself out that much
4713479 there were 10 white guys within 10 years of each other while the democratic debates really looked like america
4713480 the thing that dragged him down for a while frankly was the flds issue
4713481 as demanding as his jobs are he always will find time to spend with his kids
4713482 hes not out to get gain he wants to give back
4713483 i realized i had a better chance getting into law school than being a crappy college player
4713484 you were just one of many freaks the freak in a white shirt
4713485 that a lot of traditional washington practices were offensive were ethically wrong
4713486 a lot of people look at it from a political level
4713487 hes always very eager and willing to offer his opinion
4713488 not for the purposes of self aggrandizement but because he loves the process and thats rare
4713489 he can take off that partisan hat and wear that mentorship hat
4713490 i have a young family kids 4 to 14 and have seen firsthand how difficult it is for a young family to endure a major campaign on the other hand the entire purpose of hinckley is to get people to participate in politics and government if i ever felt like i had something unique to offer to a position i would certainly consider it
4713491 whether he would have an attack of insanity and decide to run for office who knows
4713492 preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
4713493 the biggest driver well see in the market next week is the price of a barrel of oil
4713494 unless we get some crazy m amp a activity on monday the only monkey wrench i see is some skeleton falling out of some financial closet or something heats up in georgia
4713495 its been on everyones calendar for years and nobody paid much attention
4713496 there will be some stragglers on the retail side but in general most companies are through
4713497 i dont think it matters what they say on the earnings front the broader issues for retailers are energy prices in general every time weve seen energy prices sell off the group rallies even when one retailer reports a negative number
4713498 every week we get some news that is not on the calendar but the tone seems to be improving within the financial sector
4713499 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4713500 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4713501 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4713502 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4713503 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4713504 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4713505 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4713506 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4713507 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4713508 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4713509 am visat c o s o bat c ndva pe ryoko am nvins o azi n cea mai important zi care a devenit i cea mai important zi din via a mea
4713510 mccain needs economic expertise and physical energy while obama needs experience and gravitas
4713511 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4713512 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4713513 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4713514 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4713515 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4713516 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4713517 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4713518 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4713519 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4713520 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4713521 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4713522 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4713523 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4713524 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4713525 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4713526 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4713527 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4713528 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4713529 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4713530 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4713531 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4713532 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4713533 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4713534 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4713535 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4713536 iran should not present on a silver platter the justifications and the pretexts for those who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
4713537 its good to provide the safety message and its great for kids of the town they have a lot of fun
4713538 we got lost a couple of times and broke down once but we didnt get bogged or slide off the tracks and thats a feat to be proud of
4713539 as an workaround the peruser tests setup script can be modified by adding the following lines
4713540 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4713541 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4713542 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4713543 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4713544 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4713545 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4713546 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4713547 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4713548 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4713549 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4713550 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4713551 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4713552 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4713553 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4713554 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4713555 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4713556 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4713557 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4713558 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4713559 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4713560 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4713561 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4713562 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4713563 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4713564 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4713565 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4713566 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4713567 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4713568 to check all of our machines in harrisburg and the servers as well he wants all the blackberries wiped
4713569 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4713570 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4713571 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4713572 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4713573 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4713574 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4713575 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4713576 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4713577 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4713578 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4713579 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4713580 i think i was a little afraid then but now im calm collected when i go
4713581 i had braces before and i was really interested in what my orthodontist was doing
4713582 when i ask them about how many fillings they have they know they have them but they dont know exactly where
4713583 so theyre becoming more aware of their anatomy and their own oral hygiene so thats part of the goal also
4713584 the nice thing about dentistry is that there are so many different ways of going
4713585 and with so many options there are plenty of career opportunities
4713586 its a lot of hard work i think and a lot of schooling involved
4713587 you get to work with patients and i like working with people and you can apply your science skills and math skills it just looks like a really good career to go into
4713588 they can easily get to be 18 24 inches in a straight line length they can grow to be 30 or 40 pounds so in the winter housing can be difficult for some people they usually say you need ten square feet for a sub adult so where are you going to put him when he gets that big it usually takes about 10 15 years before they grow that big so you have some time to think about it but they do get big
4713589 every designer takes a little from other inspirations a little from what they like here and there you envy something like this when you see everything done and all

4713603 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards

4713653 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4713654 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4713658 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4713659 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4713660 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny

4713668 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4713669 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4713670 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4713671 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4713672 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4713673 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4713674 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4713675 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4713676 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4713677 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4713678 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4713679 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4713680 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4713681 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4713682 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4713683 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4713684 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4713685 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4713686 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4713687 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4713688 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4713689 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4713690 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4713691 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4713692 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4713693 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4713694 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4713695 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4713696 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4713697 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4713698 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4713699 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4713700 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4713701 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4713702 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4713703 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4713704 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4713705 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4713706 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4713707 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4713708 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4713709 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4713710 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4713711 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4713712 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4713713 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4713714 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4713715 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4713716 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4713717 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4713718 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4713719 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4713720 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4713721 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4713722 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4713723 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4713724 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4713725 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4713726 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4713727 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4713728 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4713729 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4713730 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4713731 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4713732 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4713733 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4713734 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4713735 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4713736 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent

4713739 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4713740 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4713741 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4713742 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4713743 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4713744 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4713745 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4713746 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4713747 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4713748 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4713749 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4713750 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

4713753 its this commando thing of his his living here would be like a red rag to a bull he wants to be photographed playing golf and taking it easy
4713754 basically musharraf is being stubborn the two sides are playing brinkmanship
4713755 all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4713756 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out

4713788 stayers versus quitters this began to emerge as an issue in 1989 a time when singaporeans became increasingly mobile that year mr lee kuan yew had strong words for those who did materialistic calculations before deciding to stay or leave if you just do your sums plus minuses credit debit you are a washout he said the issue was revisited in 1996 when mr goh noted that some singaporeans now talked openly about emigrating he argued that successful singaporeans whom society had invested in had a special duty to make a difference to the lives of other singaporeans to opt out and emigrate is a cop out he said the issue later erupted into the stayers versus quitters debate in 2002
4713789 it is often said that the defining ideological characterization of the pap is political pragmatism

4713791 singapore and peninsular malaysia have been important areas of migration since the establishment of british colonial rule in the early nineteenth century the large and sustained immigration was engendered by the demand for labour in the public works and agricultural plantations by the good prospects for trade and commerce and by the law and order attendant on british rule such forces of attraction coupled with liberal immigration policies were reinforced by equally strong repelling forces in the immigrants countries of origin natural calamities political upheavals poverty and population pressure were the decisive factors that induced the immigrants to leave their countries

4713822 you sir are quite possibly the most misguided propaganda hound i have ever encountered id theories are rejected not out of hand merely because the concept of a creator is somehow offensive but simply because they are not theories a hypothesis has two main attributes neccessary to qualify it as a hypothesis and not merely speculation 1 the hypothesis must predict a result ie i hypothesize that if i eat something when i am hungry i will no longer be hungry or more abstractly i hypothesize that the lack of food for a period of time can cause hunger thus predicting that a if i eat my hunger will subside and b if i dont eat my hunger will appear or get worse 2 a hypothesis must be falsifiable able to be proven false example if i hypothesize that if i am hungry and i drink water my hunger will subside i then proceed to drink water and my hunger remains thus proving my hypothesis false i must then create a new hypothesis that accounts for this new information ie i must eat food to satiate my hunger id theories contain neither of these elements one cannot disprove the existence of a creator therefore it is not a hypothesis merely an unfounded belief superstition or opinion as the creationist faction has a tendency to say it is wrong to teach an opinion as a fact

4713834 perhaps the most useful service provided by pharyngula and similar sites is to demonstrate beyond dispute that evolutionary science has devolved into dogmatism
4713835 you really shouldnt use words that you dont understand heres dogma from the catholic encyclopedia
4713836 positiveness in assertion of opinion esp when unwarranted or arrogant
4713837 i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of the debate
4713838 positiveness in assertion of opinion esp when unwarranted or arrogant
4713839 we have already seen how in the belief of many alchemical authors there was a subtle spirit diffused throughout the world that spirit is described as a quinta essentia a fifth being over and above the four elements and as we have seen it was believed to exist in all earthly bodies and to be their active principle it was clear to the lullian alchemists that if this active principle coupld be extracted from a body it should be a far more active reagent than the body itself as a quintessence it was the link between our eaerthly bodies and the heavenly bodies and could ransmit to us their beneficient influence
4713840 in europe the tradition of spiritual alchemy became strongly identified with christianity and the alchemical operation was explained as the mystical path through which the individual could become on with christ who is himself the perfect stone the earliest source that draws the parallel between alchemy and christianity is identified by c g jung as the margarita pretiosa written by petrus bonus of ferrar in the fourteenth century by the 16th and 17th centuries this approach had become well established and authors exercised their metaphysical ingenuity in drawing correspondences between christian and alchemical teaching
4713841 hovering behind these four elements was a shadowy and ill defined fifth and among the medieval philosophers it was known as the quinta essencia fifth being or quintessence sometimes confused in alchemy with the philosophers stone
4713842 is jim an asshole idiot or assholish idiotic propagandist you make the call
4713843 you know frog maybe in the spirit of fairness and in the name of skepticism and every time a child is born and looks up at the moon in wonder we should re open the question of whether or not the moon is a goddess a balloon a cookie a cheese puff or some other thing that doesnt really belong up there after all to positively assert that the moon was in fact a ball of rock and dust the size of a small planet would be dogmatic
4713844 a mind in the grip of dogmatism refuses to utter the words i might be wrong
4713845 jim can you utter those words in the context of the assertions you have made here
4713846 how conveniently you overlook the countless times that geologists paleontologists anthropologists and evolutionary biologists have admitted that there are still many details of earth history of lines of descent and mechanisms of evolution that are unknown or not completely understood you close your eyes to the controversies that exist within the discipline still you assert dogmatism in the scientific community
4713847 i conclude then that you are arguing from a position of either a ignorance or b disingenuousness which is it
4713848 id isnt rejected simply because its competition its rejected because it brings virtually nothing to the table not to mention that its already been exposed as a wedge strategy for creationism and i think those who realize that are sick to death of hearing incorrect or dishonest claims to the contrary
4713849 scientists by which i mean those who deal in the scientific method not just people who self label because of degree or imagined expertise do not disagree on whether evolution is and has occurred just like there is no disagreement in the scientific world about water being comprised of hydrogen and oxygen the earth being the third planet from the sun and trees being made of wood
4713850 until the type of repeatable falsifiable evidence that props up every accepted scientific theory is found to be supportive of the id hypothesis there is not only nothing brought to the table there is no table
4713851 tell me how the ider works what laws he follows how we can predict what hell do next
4713852 you use the word darwinism the current theory has been called neo darwinian synthesis for a hundred years now
4713853 no you wont come back with the ider equation because you just dont have the brains to understand the issues at all youre trying to smuggle in theism and faith and that will only work with the ignorant or brain dead it is highly immoral to take advantage of either state to advance a political agenda
4713854 jim as one of many active anti creationists on the net you can find many more at the pandas thumb i can say that you have got it completely wrong we know your creationist literature quite well ive read behes books and dembskis and far too many others and in addition we keep up with the scientific literature
4713855 intelligent design creationism is like the most delicate flaky feather light puff pastry in comparison and that pastry is filled with slimy wet dog turds watching you defend your version of creationism with more ignorance is just too typical
4713856 rhetoric of this kind which is so typical of the darwinist faithful blah blah blah
4713857 nah thats wrong it doesnt explain every last neuronal action it doesnt predict every note on every page so beethoven was creative is a better theory and if you dismiss that as a meaningless statement its only because youre a dogmatic authoritarian out to oppress poor little ol me
4713858 i dont have a better answer but my non answer that its unknowable is better than any partial answer that it may be possible to give
4713859 you havent really addressed any issues here you have merely complained that darwinists are childish and are being mean to you
4713860 read books on the subject that were written without peer review
4713861 you do realize that theres a whole slew of creationist apologists from kennedy to johnson to weikart who routinely accuse biologists of being nazis and of inspiring the nazis dont you to be consistent you should have no time or respect for id man the irony is thick around these creationists isnt it
4713862 from darwin to hitler evolutionary ethics eugenics and racism in germany
4713863 when i draw connections between darwin german darwinists eugenicists racial theorists or militarists i am not thereby endorsing their logic nor am i making the absurd claim that darwinism of logical necessity leads directly or indirectly to nazism
4713864 the philosophy that fueled german militarism and hitlerism is taught as fact in every american public school with no disagreement allowed
4713865 darwinism by itself did not produce the holocaust but without darwinism especially in its social darwinist and eugenics permutations neither hitler nor his nazi followers would have had the necessary scientific underpinnings to convince themselves and their collaborators that one of the worlds greatest atrocities was really morally praiseworthy darwinism or at least some naturalistic interpretation of darwinism succeeded in turning morality on its head
4713866 ive made essentially no effort here to defend the scientific legitimacy of id theory
4713867 positiveness in assertion of opinion esp when unwarranted or arrogant
4713868 thanks guys its always gratifying to me that darwinists are so quick to resort to name calling nothing more clearly demonstrates the bankruptcy of their position than such childish polemics keep up the good work

4713882 the project has provided significant returns to our shareholders and the people of newfoundland and labrador
4713883 with good production and record oil prices the white rose development reached top tier royalty payout in march 2008 the dual rig strategy will help husky meet its timelines for the white rose satellite development and will give us the flexibility to pursue a range of exploration delineation and development options
4713884 no fees shall be charged for a lunch program provided by a public school during regular school hours
4713885 were looking at our staffing needs and trying to make the positions attractive
4713886 its challenging hiring individuals for an hour a day and securing their commitment for the full school year
4713887 everybody takes a break at lunch time so why not take a break and do lunch with the students support the needs of the school and enjoy the experience of working with children
4713888 as you can see theres a lot of glass allowing a lot of light into the building
4713889 both clients paid 30 each source a was paid 60 for their service
4713890 source a explained that the employees of the escort service get the full amount of monies paid by the first two customers the money paid by the third customer goes to the employer
4713891 the informant const deveau has knowledge and experience that escort services are fronts for prostitution
4713892 this would be consistent with most common bawdy houses where the client can purchase 30 minutes to one hour time slots
4713893 based on my experience a night search would avail a better chance of finding employees and customers on site
4713894 additionally a night search would more likely result in the presence of cash receipts and other documentation that would further support the outlined charges
4713895 its just one of the things like a wheelchair its something they need
4713896 we travel a lot in europe and they never charge us for anything
4713897 you cant lug them around all the time you need wheels and you need car seats for their safety
4713898 its nickel and diming theyre going to get all the money they want out of you its just a way to pass the buck
4713899 theyre very upset and theyre caught off guard that they have to pay it
4713900 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4713901 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4713902 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4713903 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4713904 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4713905 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4713906 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4713907 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4713908 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4713909 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4713910 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4713911 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4713912 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4713913 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4713914 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4713915 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4713916 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4713917 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4713918 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4713919 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4713920 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4713921 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4713922 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4713923 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4713924 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4713925 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4713926 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4713927 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4713930 judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against correa
4713931 they know they can lose their position and that they can be called traitor to the country
4713932 the support from the government will translate into help in gathering proof and support for the population directly affected by the contamination texaco produced
4713933 we met with our friends that have fought for many years in the amazon against chevron texaco our friends can be certain that they have the entire support of the country in which is considered one of the largest disasters in history the spills the waste the pits that were left by chevrontexaco during its disastrous operation in the country
4713934 no remediation was done here they just covered all the waste
4713935 here we have attorneys these lawyer turncoats who for a fistful of dollars are capable of selling their souls their country
4713936 i hereby call the attorney general to present a report to the general comptrollers office establishing criminal responsibilities against petroecuadors officials who signed this nonsense
4713937 i want to take this opportunity to show my solidarity to our fellow countrymen in the amazonia especially luis yanza and those who have fought for justice our dear friends luis and pablo you have set an example for everyone
4713938 we continued with our regular office activities and then received representatives of the amazon defense front who have been fighting for decades against chevrontexaco they have all the support of the national government

4713942 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4713943 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4713944 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4713945 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4713955 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4713956 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4713957 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4713958 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4713959 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4713960 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4713961 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4713962 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4713963 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4713964 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4713965 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4713966 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4713972 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4713973 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4713974 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4713975 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4713978 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4713979 they asked me things like are you prepared to be celibate
4713980 i wanted to get away from everything for a while
4713981 i was hoeing turnips and i heard the voice of god saying what are you doing here i dont want you to hoe turnips i want you to be a priest in my church
4713982 she told the bishop get him out of there because hes killing himself
4713983 i loved him in the way you love a wonderful priest
4713984 i said you have a lovely view i wouldnt mind living here
4713985 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4713986 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4713987 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4713988 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4713989 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4713990 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4713991 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4713992 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4713993 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4713994 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4713995 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4713996 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4713997 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4713998 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4713999 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4714000 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4714001 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4714002 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4714003 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4714004 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4714005 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4714006 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4714007 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4714008 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4714009 el mundo ha visto con inquietud c mo rusia invad a un estado soberano vecino y amenazaba a un gobierno elegido democr ticamente por su pueblo
4714010 este acto es completamente inaceptable para las naciones libres del mundo
4714011 para comenzar a reparar el da o que ha causado a sus relaciones con estados unidos europa y otros pa ses y para empezar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo
4714012 we are extremely pleased to be working in partnership with pttep in the pursuit of flng opportunities pttep has a clear strategy to expand its e amp p business and it brings to the partnership strong capabilities that are complementary to golars floating mid stream capability
4714013 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4714014 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4714015 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4714016 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4714017 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4714018 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4714019 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4714020 who are open to doing something on the production side
4714021 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4714022 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4714023 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4714024 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4714025 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4714026 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4714027 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4714028 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4714029 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4714030 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4714031 we hope it is not just a flash in the pan
4714032 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4714033 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies
4714034 yeah i lost it to one of the soccer coaches at my schoo
4714035 i am pleased to report that robust production performance in a record oil price environment has propelled addax petroleum to yet another quarter of record financial results activity levels on all our business fronts were high through the second quarter and on balance our operational performance was good our production levels were slightly below expectations and may remain so for the balance of the year but continue to be strong given supply constraints ongoing in the sector during the second quarter we also continued to expand addax petroleums property portfolio with four new license interest acquisitions this new business activity is closely aligned with our dynamic exploration program which had mixed results during the second quarter but remain exciting for the balance of the year i am particularly pleased and encouraged that our initiatives to commercialize our reserves in kurdistan and gas resources in nigeria are gaining momentum and can offer excellent value for our shareholders

4714056 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4714057 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4714058 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4714059 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4714060 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4714061 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4714062 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4714063 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4714064 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4714065 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4714066 we cant deny theres been a lot of turnover since i got here
4714067 for me it just got to a point where i let the game start coming to me
4714068 i quit forcing things which most receivers cant help if nothings going right for them and the team
4714069 its no secret that we didnt have a lot of faith in our passing game
4714070 when mike bill musgrave and terry robiskie put this offense together it was based on not just what they know but what our guys can do
4714071 those guys are very talented receivers that might be one of our stronger groups from top to bottom
4714072 only a few people play in vanuatu about fifteen theres only four tables and one club
4714073 when i walk around port vila vanuatus capital people come and talk to me and take pictures with me
4714074 these are international competitors theyre too strong for me my goal is to get up to six points in my match
4714075 its always been a goal of mine i never really expected i could do it at this moment
4714076 its just such a dream i heard she is here and it would be really nice to meet her
4714077 if the queen is watching this girl should be made a dame dame rebecca adlington shes my best mate so im allowed to say that
4714078 when i realized i was on my own i just went for it i couldnt have done it without my mum and dad it was fantastic that they were finally here
4714079 you have to push yourself push your body every single session
4714080 theres times you dont want to drive home you want to sit on the pool deck and want superpowers to get you home in bed im glad the hard work paid off
4714081 he just built me up and to be honest i couldnt have done it without him
4714082 i touched that wall and said thank goodness im thrilled with how ive done and how i competed i couldnt ask for anything more
4714083 im really excited by that race i just wanted to go in and see what i had in me
4714084 i think being a competitor i never let that the three silvers get into my mind and take over i just wanted a good race and focus on what i needed to do
4714085 i think shes handled herself beautifully having to come back after some disappointments and be able to stay focused
4714086 we talked about not thinking about the outcome not thinking about what medal she would get
4714087 we actually used the words like a school yard race just go race because you love to race and you hate to lose and go race the girl you love to race she loves to race margaret and we knew that would be her toughest competitor
4714088 were friends and weve been battling back and forth in what seems like every race
4714089 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4714090 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud it will be exciting back home
4714091 it came out well i was able to achieve the gold medal which i have wanted for a very long time
4714092 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4714093 if i am ready to swim and win in an olympic final with the best swimmers in the world
4714094 then i am ready to tackle the media the difficult part is behind me i gave up a lot of things to concentrate on my training so easier things are before me im pretty much ready for anything
4714095 it is a wonderful beautiful medal it is something huge when you look at the level of performance in these races it is not any worse than the 100 meter gold it is the same value
4714096 i was already 29 at athens and in the badminton world its considered pretty extraordinary so i didnt think i would actually get the gold
4714097 through the injuries i kept encouraging myself to keep going and to be able to come to these olympics i worked really really hard
4714098 i touched that wall and said thank goodness im thrilled with how ive done and how i competed i couldnt ask for anything more
4714099 im really excited by that race i just wanted to go in and see what i had in me
4714100 i think being a competitor i never let that the three silvers get into my mind and take over i just wanted a good race and focus on what i needed to do
4714101 i think shes handled herself beautifully having to come back after some disappointments and be able to stay focused
4714102 we talked about not thinking about the outcome not thinking about what medal she would get
4714103 we actually used the words like a school yard race just go race because you love to race and you hate to lose and go race the girl you love to race she loves to race margaret and we knew that would be her toughest competitor
4714104 were friends and weve been battling back and forth in what seems like every race
4714105 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4714106 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud it will be exciting back home
4714107 i would say ive got some new strengths on the interior line
4714108 it could have been kind of predictable last year but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
4714109 ive been working on a couple of different things and trying out some things some of it ill keep some of it ill probably throw away hopefully once we get into a game and i use them well see how it works
4714110 you do definitely need counters to moves that would be considered your key move
4714111 willie can still rush a lot of people think he cant but hell surprise a lot of people
4714112 murray cook the guy who did this is a genius
4714113 in the states we can build a field in a month here it takes three or four months
4714114 nothing was there its hard to describe virtually none of this was in working order its just incredible
4714115 he had some help obviously murray is not simply a guy who directs people hes a hands on guy he gets out there with a hose he drives the grass cutters this place is a thousand times better than it was
4714116 a slow boat it got here the day of the first practice 35 tons
4714117 hes a hero to the younger generation and the pride of older chinese
4714118 there are only very few chinese athletes with this level of fame
4714119 we need to solve several problems together including recovering from injury improving competition form and helping him with his rhythm
4714120 although time is tight i think we can solve these problems
4714121 having the world record gives you confidence it means you can go on the line and think to yourself you know what if i run to my very best i will be the champion
4714122 if robles runs his very best the cuban can beat him
4714123 i was so nervous before the race i did it it was my best race ever
4714124 today was my lucky day the sun shone on me im so overwhelmed with emotion
4714125 i gave up a lot for this medal i never saw my family but the hardest things have gone before me
4714126 i havent yet achieved the time i am looking for thats a secret and when i get it ill let you know

4714185 the buskers festival is an absolute need for the economy within the halifax regional marketplace as well as for the province because there are tourism spinoffs with people who come from all over
4714186 without the funding help of the province the federal government as well as hrm and their continued support there wont be a halifax international buskers festival
4714187 culture staff advised the society to apply for three other culture funding programs
4714188 absolutely not and i have e mails to support it all
4714189 they do that for absolutely every single one of the festivals and they were scrambling to come up with a response so the premier could say well we gave them money
4714190 they are skating because they know they have made a mistake
4714191 i have one part of the province that has bent over backwards and that is the marketing division and were there other avenues where i could go absolutely not

4714194 bodes well for overall gdp gross domestic product growth in june returning to positive growth after the disappointing 0 1 per cent drop in may
4714195 going forward activity in manufacturing will be helped by rising new orders particularly for aerospace products and the recent depreciation of the canadian dollar
4714196 this factor is expected to keep the central banks overnight rate unchanged in canada at a still stimulative three per cent through the remainder of this year despite the bank of canada indicating concern about inflation pressures building in the system
4714197 the bottom line is that even in spite of the lower canadian dollar manufacturing sales are likely to remain weak until at least the spring of 2009 when the u s economy begins to show improvement
4714198 petroleum and coal products led the advance thanks to higher commodity prices while the auto sector also managed to post a gain in the month
4714199 new orders rose a solid 2 9 per cent while the inventory to sales ratio dipped to 1 27 the lowest level since april 07 and an encouraging sign that factories are getting leaner

4714203 the near term is still going to look pretty challenging
4714204 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes
4714205 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4714206 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak

4714223 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4714224 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4714225 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4714226 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community

4714307 that wise men have said grinding is a natural appetite
4714308 if they so and so is witty then it became known amongst them that she is a grinder
4714309 there are also women who are more intelligent than the others they possess many of the ways of men so that they resemble them even in their movements the manner in which they talk and their voice such women would like to be the active partner and they would like to be superior to the man who makes this possible for them such a woman does not shame herself either if she seduces whom she desires if she has no inclination he cannot force her to make love this makes it difficult for her to submit to the wishes of men and brings her to lesbian love most of the women with these characteristics are to be found among the educated and elegant women the scribes koran readers and female scholars
4714310 some southwest asian and north african terms for homosexual roles
4714311 for a woman to be witty is itself transgression against orthodox muslim ideals of womanhood as well as subversion of those ideals

4714314 she provides a subtle response to the denunciation of homosexuality as void or emptiness the two lips fit each other both women are active during the sexual act there is mutuality and reciprocity furthermore there is pleasure taken in the work and the turning of sides without worry the two lovers uninhibited by the limited duration of the erection can turn sides until they achieve their satisfaction

4714317 more eager to lie with women than with men in fact they pursue women with almost masculine jealousy de morbis chronicis 4
4714318 who is masculine mutathakeera in appearance and this becomes apparent in her from an early age she competes with men and resembles them and scorns haughtily rejects submitting to them she rejects being fucked and undermines penises and competes with men over deflowering other women and she equals the men in jealousy over and protection of women
4714319 unlike other latin nouns derived from this greek verb tribas retains its greek nominative ending it is also associated with women who appropriate masculine behavior by seeking physical gratification not merely by rubbing but by penetrating as one would with a male organ the orifices of other females it is somewhat of a misnomer

4714347 why would the big four music companies agree to let apple and others distribute their music without using drm systems to protect it
4714348 the simplest answer is because drms havent worked and may never work to halt music piracy
4714349 the lack of operability among a proliferating range of digital platforms and devices is increasingly becoming an issue for music consumers
4714350 emi has been engaging with our various partners to find a solution
4714351 so if the music companies are selling over 90 of their music drm free what benefits do they get from selling the remaining small percentage of their music encumbered with a drm system
4714352 the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players
4714353 this can only be seen as a positive by the music companies
4714354 todays most popular ipod holds 1 000 songs and research tells us that the average ipod is nearly full
4714355 this means that only 22 out of 1 000 songs or under 3 of the music on the average ipod is purchased from the itunes store and protected with a drm the remaining 97 of the music is unprotected and playable on any player that can play the open formats its hard to believe that just 3 of the music on the average ipod is enough to lock users into buying only ipods in the future
4714356 drm only serves to restrict consumer choice prevents a larger digital music market from emerging and often makes consumers unwitting accomplices to the ambitions of technology companies

4714361 for oman our trade relations with the united states has been really very small in absolute dollars
4714362 nevertheless from such a decision until comprehensive and diverse large scale trade there are still some challenges that need to be met
4714363 omani firms have reportedly avoided marketing any identifiable israeli consumer products
4714364 watching the behaviour of young israeli soldiers towards an elderly palestinian man on my first day in jerusalem at a checkpoint felt very familiar
4714365 id seen this in south africa where i grew up
4714366 ive always been a doctor interested in human rights and wider questions and you could say that doctors have as much a responsibility to speak out about the social and political causes of distress and disease as they have to treat the individual patients
4714367 in a bad state though not remotely as bad as it is now
4714368 i was in gaza on the day the so called peace process was signed in oslo in august 1993 and it was very interesting because most of the people i knew there were incredibly happy they thought it was the end of it all but a minority of palestinians said and they turned out to be right this wasnt a deal and were pessimistic and that yasser arafat didnt know what he was signing
4714369 the most awful crime has been played out down there by a colonial power that considered itself part of europe they were grabbing palestinians land and torturing them in ways that were reminiscent of south africa but as it turns out far far worse than south africa
4714370 much more openly brutal and the major powers didnt say anything
4714371 when before they went on a raid the israeli defence board used to discuss how it would look in europe and the us they dont bother with that any more so clearly torture was a major question there
4714372 basically spent some time in israeli detention some of them for years
4714373 all of which pointed to consistent torture as state policy in israel and the appalling use of indiscriminate fire power against children who throw stones
4714374 close range by snipers a single bullet to the head or neck
4714375 they should not condone or be present during torture and they should speak out if they come across it
4714376 the israeli medical association is a signatory to these declarations yet it became clear that it was in complete complicity in the war crimes committed by the israeli state
4714377 more unarmed palestinian civilians since september 2000 than the number of people who died on 11 september 2001
4714378 i dont cite my opinion i quote international rights groups and un bodies the facts are there already
4714379 im called that all the time it doesnt inhibit me if anything it encourages me because it means im getting through to them so they make a fight but the point about a fight is that it creates more publicity and its conscientising it wakes up people one way or the other and part of the story here is when is the doctor a doctor that is to say its a humanitarian profession supposedly it has a moral authority in a society healing people regardless of politics and when is a doctor a citizen this is another matter altogether and what ive discovered is that at the end of the day israeli doctors have made it clear their loyalty is to israeli citizenship and if israel says they must torture palestinians and shoot children in the street then those doctors will do their best to cover it up or make it sound ok to put a nice face on it theyre putting a nice face on the occupation
4714380 which makes the question are you a citizen or a doctor more poignant
4714381 the head of the ima who is in charge of medical ethics knows that doctors have a duty to speak out against torture but he said to them come on whats a couple of broken fingers when you interrogate a palestinian man for the information we can get
4714382 these are academics so they have a certain public status
4714383 of course its difficult to run it and there are tremendous pressures but were optimistic
4714384 brings out whats happening and the point is the collusion of the academic establishment in israel not one israeli university protested when palestinian universities were shut berzeit university was shut for three years at one point students are shot at check points they cant get to lectures doctors cant get to see patients nothing some israeli universities are now founded on palestinian land stolen land academia especially medical academia is in complete collusion with the colonial expansionist state
4714385 we try to get aid in to gaza teach in universities in palestine and we give palestinian students places to study in britain
4714386 an israeli doctor will applaud me and buy me a drink if i write about sudan guatemala or china if i were to cross out israel and put sudan that would be great but because i say its israel they say to me youre a pro terrorist propagandist or they call me nazi in psychology we say we have many rooms in our head and one has to ask which one are you in and speaking from in some of our rooms we dont behave the same the fact is that ive been consistently bold on israel and they tell me there must be some weird reason why i am an anti semite
4714387 support for israel is embedded in western systems without doubt the us and the uk regard israel as a european country israel continues to play the holocaust story and anti semitism as a way of blocking the truth
4714388 its a much harder struggle than the struggle against apartheid so none of us fools ourselves but i think weve had some modest effects and i think they continue israel certainly has taken them extremely seriously every time an israeli cabinet minister comes to london the first thing he wants to talk about is the boycott what they fear is the rhetorical power that these things echo thats what theyre afraid of
4714389 ultimately what would be effective would be not buying israeli goods and trying to get companies to take their investments out of israeli linked companies
4714390 of course its terribly slow and of course most people are not political
4714391 clearly we have to influence the politicians but out of 550 mps in britain more than 200 were drawn in as friends of israel and their concern is to block these things to hide it it is extraordinary how strong the lobby is
4714392 do you realise you have more power to do good in the world if three or four jewish professors who have connections with the ima say that involvement of israeli doctors in interrogation rooms has to stop the torture will have to stop because then shabak the general security services wouldnt be able to proceed in their usual way i tell them that not doing this is moral corruption
4714393 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4714394 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4714395 i have two grandchildren and a lot of friends who have been having babies and ive been invited to several baby showers and wanted to give them baby gifts
4714396 i was going from store to store to find quality items and was going from place to place to find personalized gifts i wasnt able to find anything i was happy with so i decided to start my own business
4714397 i wanted quality products i wanted them to be unique and i wanted them to be able to be personalized
4714398 i did a lot of searching before i decided on which products i wanted
4714399 i was a mother a teacher and now im a grandmother
4714400 i have lots of experience and research to send along to parents grandparents relatives and friends
4714401 i want to get more items on my website and im going to keep developing my blog im going to be adding childrens cds and more educational baby gift items i also want to add more clothes particularly organic clothes
4714402 we have a dog of our own that were very much in love with
4714403 my thought process was that dogs need lots of things such as a safe place to live after spending considerable time at dog shows veterinarians and grooming facilities i decided that one of the products i would like to represent is the doghouse
4714404 i will use the blog as an informational item to share with people who are interested in dogs
4714405 dog health issues the sizes the foods things of that nature the things that will serve the dog owner well in terms of the maintenance and care of their dogs
4714406 my future plan is to continue to build on the quality world class service and to continue searching the market to provide new products

4714432 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4714433 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4714434 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4714435 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4714436 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4714438 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4714439 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4714440 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4714441 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4714442 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4714443 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4714444 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4714445 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4714446 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4714447 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4714448 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4714449 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4714488 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4714489 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4714490 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4714491 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4714492 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4714493 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4714494 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4714495 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4714496 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4714497 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4714498 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4714499 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4714500 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4714539 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4714540 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4714541 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4714542 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4714543 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4714545 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

4714547 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4714548 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4714549 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4714572 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4714573 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4714574 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4714575 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4714577 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4714578 what is evidence based medicine and how to we apply it
4714579 at its core evidence based medicine challenges physicians to be more critical in their appraisal of the evidence and to weigh all of the evidence relating to a particular clinical scenario appropriately more to the point evidence based medicine delivers the tools to do so for these reasons proponents of evidence based medicine maintain that evidence based medicine can and should play an integral role in the effective practice of medicine one thing is for sure evidence based medicine isnt just the trend du jour it can empower you to make the most informed decisions regarding patient care
4714580 evidence based medicine words youve heard for years but what do they really mean

4714601 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4714602 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4714603 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4714604 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4714605 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4714606 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market

4714632 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right

4714650 i found from the two islands that i have lived on jamaica and american samoa that swimming is not a high priority and there are a lot of drownings as a result
4714651 that is why i got involved in the swimming association in american samoa to hopefully get more people comfortable in the water safe in the water

4714655 this was a big step for me coming back in the third round to grab a spot in the final round
4714656 i had to control myself on the first throw to make sure i got one in the sector
4714657 i had to wait another 20 minutes to throw my second attempt and i was even more nervous because i now needed a strong throw to qualify i had poor technique and the throw went about 100 feet out
4714658 i had to write down the things i needed to focus on because with all of the distractions around me it was hard to keep a level head
4714659 i did a few drills to warm up and asked god to help me relax and guide my feet
4714660 i stepped in the ring and the only thing i can remember is being relaxed and remembering what my throw should feel like i let my body take over and put my fears aside
4714661 you get past the preliminaries and make it to the finals it can really take the pressure off

4714683 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

4714711 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4714712 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4714713 theres even some evidence that al maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
4714714 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point

4714776 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4714777 i love you i think the industry is missing a boyband and you rule the vibe is great between you
4714778 i like your personalities and its the first time i like each voice in a group
4714779 i loved everything about it youre not contrived you have an early motown feel to you
4714780 i thought you were absolutely terrific great voices very very happy with you
4714781 if dhl if something happens its going to be like a ghost town
4714782 i thought i was doing a good job providing for my family and to have that taken away
4714783 its tough times when its a foreign entity coming in and sucker punching us thats how this felt
4714784 in washington john mccain helped pave the way for foreign owned dhl to take over an american shipping company
4714785 mccains campaign manager was lead lobbyist for the deal now thousands of ohio jobs at risk
4714786 its now clear that the obama campaigns attack on john mccain and the dhl issue which obama campaign manager david plouffe called the most important development in the campaign is based on a lie
4714787 sen obama believes a focus on the middle class is appropriate in the wake of the first economic expansion on record where the typical familys income fell by almost 1 000
4714788 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash
4714789 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4714790 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4714791 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4714792 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4714793 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4714794 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4714795 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4714796 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4714797 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4714798 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4714799 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4714800 i have done everything i can to comply with the law and be a good citizen
4714801 i would never hurt anyone but none of that matters now
4714802 im not sure mccain was saying that the book was funny
4714803 during that time his infatuation with street fighting grew and he developed a language of confrontational militancy that became more and more extreme over the year 1969

4714861 la clave est en que el profesional sanitario indague con el paciente para saber si lo que realmente siente es una enfermedad o m s bien una situaci n normal de su vida
4714862 faltan tiempo y medios humanos en un sistema sanitario cada vez m s exprimido
4714863 claudican ante el paciente es muy dif cil luchar contra la idea que impera en la sociedad de que todo se cura con pastillas la medicina y los medicamentos no son capaces de solucionar todos los problemas ni el m dico es un dios ni los medicamentos son p cimas m gicas para la vida
4714864 hay dos v as que favorecen la psiquiatrizaci n explicaba el psiquiatra guillermo rendueles en un debate recogido en el diario la nueva espa a una la gesti n de los aspectos ntimos y sentimentales que suele recaer en el psiquiatra por las dificultades que tienen las personas para hacerlo por s mismas y otra el que en la sociedad de hoy no hay nada s lido es la sociedad l quida de bauman
4714865 la medicina ha hecho suyos un mont n de problemas que antes no eran asunto m dico y para los que a menudo no hay soluci n eficaz
4714866 el 90 de la producci n mundial de medicamentos es consumido por el 10 de la poblaci n
4714867 la sociedad de la desigualdad que estamos creando concluye ojer es capaz de mirar con indiferencia el drama de miles de personas que mueren diariamente por no tener acceso a lo m s b sico para vivir mientras es incapaz de tolerar el m nimo sufrimiento y sigue consumiendo bienes de consumo con la esperanza de alcanzar el maximo bienestar
4714868 las compa as farmac uticas tienen un claro inter s en medicalizar los problemas de la vida y ahora ya existe un enfermo por cada f rmaco
4714869 se quiere imponer socialmente la idea de que es posible siempre vivir en positivo y que se pueden alcanzar soluciones f cilmente con independencia de la realidad vital de cada uno
4714870 es imposible librarse a voluntad de determinados pensamientos sentimientos o sensaciones desagradables que son inherentes al hecho de vivir en este mundo se entiende no anestesiados al hecho en fin de ser humanos
4714871 esto tampoco significa a ade confundir la aceptaci n con la resignaci n entendida sta como actitud pasiva cuando hablo de aceptar me refiero a admitir que determinados contenidos mentales son inevitables pero eso no significa cruzarse de brazos ante las adversidades o las injusticias todo lo contrario precisamente porque no podemos dejar de sentirnos mal ante determinadas situaciones lo que debemos procurar es mejorar las cosas
4714872 muchos psic logos y psiquiatras han sido los primeros en caer en la trampa de pensar que al igual que en el mbito f sico no hay que pasarlo mal un solo minuto no explicamos al paciente que a lo mejor es normal que su sufrimiento contin e durante un tiempo indeterminado
4714873 necesitamos un tiempo para encontrarnos mal hacerle a alguien sentirse culpable porque no vuelve a mostrar la alegr a que todos socialmente debemos exhibir acarrea llevar al sujeto a una situaci n imposible pues no ser capaz de alegrarse como los dem s se convierte en un motivo a adido de preocupaci n y tristeza

4714905 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4714906 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4714907 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4714908 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4714909 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4714910 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
4714911 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
4714912 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
4714913 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4714914 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4714915 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4714916 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4714917 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4714918 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4714919 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4714920 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4714921 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4714922 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
4714923 yo c word you are one r word n word

4714926 while there may be young men on estates missing fathers who left them there are also children in middle britain whose parents become strangers in a culture of long working hours
4714927 in society the fetishisation of money and the growth of consumerism add new pressure
4714928 inequality plays its part as young men from poor backgrounds feel they have less to lose
4714929 why one boy asked me was i worried about his grades at school when he might not live long enough to get a job
4714930 this is the world of get rich or die trying
4714931 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4714932 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4714933 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4714934 i actually thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4714935 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i let my roar out
4714936 i really dont know what to say i guess ive had the perfect situations all week
4714937 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4714938 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4714939 i just have one race left the relay and then its done
4714940 tying spitzs record is pretty cool its great to be a part of all of this
4714941 not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4714942 two independent timing systems showed exactly the same on the time phelps was 50 58 cavic was 50 59
4714943 the automatic timing systems are in perfect order and there are no doubts
4714944 although the rules dont allow for team leaders to watch the video footage i had a meeting with the serbia team leaders to afford them the opportunity to see the video themselves because we dont want them to go away feeling something is lost
4714945 the serbian team were very satisfied and agreed with the comments of the referee
4714946 michael phelps is the greatest ever and he would have been first in this race any how the question was whether to share the gold medal or not to share
4714947 but what the referee saw was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever the first arrival was michael phelps
4714948 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4714949 i am not angry i knew it would be a fast race and i knew michael would be fast
4714950 i knew he would be coming at me there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles
4714951 pupunta nga sana ako sa concert niya at makikita ko ang lahat ng mga naging leading man niya medyo naiinggit nga ako e medyo naramdaman ko nga na sumikip ang dibdib ko e dahil wala ako doon pero sabi ko bakit ako wala doon pero siyempre baka isipin ng tao iniisnab ko yung concert niya hindi ayoko lang ng intriga katulad nga ng sabi ni sharon mas mabuti na lang para walang intriga baka yun lang ang mangyari so nirerespeto ko yun
4714952 hindi kami nagkita sa the buzz pero nagkita kami sa tagaytay may shooting siya doon dinalaw ko siya siyempre masyado siyang busy masyado akong busy e kung kelan ako libre busy siya kung libre naman siya busy ako tinawagan ko siya sabi ko asan ka ngayon sabi niya papunta raw siyang tagaytay sabi ko o sige puntahan na kita diyan para makita kita
4714953 tinawagan ko nga si annabelle kaninang umaga e e hindi ko alam ang itatawag ko sa kanya matagal ko na rin naman siyang tinatawag na tita e tita pa rin kasi hindi naman sa nang iintriga ako pero halimbawa napag uusapan naman alangan namang tawagin ko siyang balae e kapag nagkahiwalay balik na naman sa tita kaya tita na lang
4714954 bata pa lang yan e ang babait naman yang mga yan kung meron mang nangyayari sa kanila more than the movie e sa kanila na yun
4714955 ako kahit na sino basta maganda ang pagkakagawa e kasi marami nang mga ganyan e kung yung mga kanta rin na re remake yung mga pelikula na re remake din e buhay pa naman si danny zialcita yung director namin sa dear heart baka puwedeng siya pa ang mag direct baka meron pa siyang ibang view

4714958 its become so contentious in so many ways i think peoples overall faith in government is not real high
4714959 after the athens games i didnt think about participating in the beijing games especially during the last two years
4714960 i wasnt doing very well and i was kind of confused i didnt know what to do but then i persevered i tried very hard i did a lot of training so this gold didnt come very easy
4714961 i did a lot and paid a lot for this gold
4714962 im 33 years old and i made it to the finals in this beijing games i believe it was tenacity that got me this gold medal
4714963 since i didnt get the gold medal im still a bit upset and i just hope that tomorrow lin dan will be able to beat lee chong wei
4714964 im not thinking about london olympics now its hard to imagine if i will participate
4714965 when i first competed in worlds i did not know what the british parliamentary format was like i have never encountered such a phenomenon before
4714966 its not discussed in our editorials not written about in our student papers there really wasnt anyone or much of anyone to debate with
4714967 its a shame because in many prominent universities abroad debate is the ultimate academic activity
4714968 you have to prove yourself all the time and more often than not youll lose its a high pressure highly competitive environment
4714969 students are apprehensive to debate because they dont have the linguistic abilities to be able to convey ideas
4714970 people dont like watching debates in general because they think its just for smart alecks and pilosopos who are good at using big words without even believing what they say
4714971 a lot of people think we are serious that were bookish in reality we do tend to talk about things that are more serious than a lot of more mainstream topics but id like to think that we are still a very healthy well rounded group of people who also have fun and are exposed to various things
4714972 a lot of the debate topics revolve around politics economics social issues so even if there are topics like pop culture or even sports and local events the perception of non debaters is that everything in debate is abstract
4714973 one can learn the skills involved in debate so the important thing is that youre really interested in discussing the issues
4714974 you have to work doubly hard to make an impact in one worlds tournament then youll be gone for three years and all your efforts would go to waste
4714975 its difficult to compare because each university and country has a distinct style but philippine debating can definitely match up with everyone elses
4714976 weve hosted the worlds weve consistently done well at worlds so someone who goes to worlds
4714977 i expect ateneo to win over a yale or a princeton or a harvard
4714978 they speak really well fluently they dont have problems grasping for words
4714979 but in terms of content we can be at par with them its really a matter of delivery and engagement
4714980 the issues we discuss and the ways we tackle them tend to differ from the way they do
4714981 the biases dont even need to be explicit like the things that judges from europe would look for would be different from judges from asia would look for sadly some judges do have explicit racial biases you can complain but you cant lobby to overturn the decision in your favor
4714982 you can feel it while youre inside the room because its as if theyre whispering what are they doing here
4714983 we dont change the way we think but we try to adapt by for example trying to give examples familiar to the adjudicators in other words by being able to fit their description of a good debater
4714984 the majority of the adjudicators are fair but sometimes if you face biased adjudicators its simply bad luck
4714985 i really think that the community would grow and that smaller institutions would become more established
4714986 the differences in skill between manila and non manila based teams is getting smaller and smaller and manila institutions would have to contend with many more provincial teams
4714987 even if we dont win the world championships overnight hopefully we position ourselves well because thats almost half of the battle being able to position yourself as one of the top tier schools
4714988 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
4714989 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
4714990 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4714991 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4714992 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4714993 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4714994 and god bless them for putting up with me as i got better and better over the years as i saw the amazing changes the gong produced in hundreds of people in the yoga classes i knew i had to write a book about how its sound works on the mind and body and how to use it both therapeutically and in the deeper practices of yoga

4715008 karadzic hat nichts heroisches oder nobles oder gar unzivilisiertes an sich er ist nur ein kleiner mann mit einem riesigen ego einer unheilbaren paranoia und einem unstillbaren machthunger jeder der drei berufe in denen er sich versuchte hat mit macht ber leben und tod zu tun das war es was ihn interessierte im zerfallenden jugoslawien bot sich die chance steile karriere zu machen und die uneinigkeit der europ er erm glichte es ihm sich allzu lange in seinem amt zu halten sein aufstieg ist nur das ergebnis unserer ohnmacht in einem gesunden land bringen es leute wie er nicht sehr weit

4715017 benjamin is a great name i love the name benjamin
4715018 every benjamin i ever met in my life was a jerk i cant give my baby a jerk name
4715019 gee i wonder if its time for me to dust off that old secret to world peace in my basement
4715020 they shouldve gotten him out of detroit a long time ago hes an embarrassment to detroit they dont even want him
4715021 i hope they show him a cold shoulder they shouldve kept him in jail
4715022 i dont think he should still be in jail hes got a job to do
4715023 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
4715024 i dont think he should still be in jail hes got a job to do
4715025 he might be a good man but hes done some bad things all the money he took from the people they should have set the bond higher than that
4715026 he thought he was the big man on campus and they brought him down a notch because really hes not trustworthy
4715027 he knew he was supposed to have restrictions if they feel they cant trust him this is what they have to do
4715028 ive been in and out of jail since 1971 ive seen many people violate their bond and all they do is reinstate their bond
4715029 i think that its good that there are restrictions on him at least he has to take some responsibility for his actions
4715030 i think its fair they gave him a lot of chances and he blew it
4715031 when the grown people are struggling it makes it harder on our children he messed up admit it and step down
4715032 i dont think its a good thing that theyre sending him to jail everybody has done something bad at some point if everybody was judged accordingly wed all be in hell
4715033 mayor kilpatrick needs to step down so the city the region and the state can begin to move forward if the mayor is exonerated in court i am confident he will be rewarded by the public for putting the people first during these challenging times
4715034 mayor faces new probe for run in with officers deputy says he was pushed but kilpatrick lawyer says there was no roughness
4715035 a diverse gathering of supporters from corporate and civic backgrounds who are committed to the mayors vigorous defense
4715036 he certainly should not resign because hes the best we have
4715037 were not going to offer a reaction because we dont want to compromise the process
4715038 i personally have no confidence in those persons in the mayors office and those who surround him in their ability to govern our city out of this quagmire that we find ourselves in at this time
4715039 the man keeps his mansion the woman almost got tethered
4715040 for the betterment of the citizens of detroit i believe the mayor should resign
4715041 it has been my belief as ive said earlier enough is enough whatever they contain they should be public
4715042 lets stop all this stuff and deal with the consequences
4715043 i dont think the city should be held up to ridicule for his behavior hes never been called to task for anything that hes done i would like for him to be treated like any other citizen i want as a city official that he not be given a day pass
4715044 made me very sad sad for him and for his family
4715045 it was an extremely tough speech for the mayor to give under any circumstance i just have one question i wonder if carlita has a sister at home she was outstanding for her to stand there and speak as eloquently as she did she helped kwames cause immensely where do you find a woman like that but the important thing is hes going to go to work tomorrow and thats probably the best therapy for the mayor and the city
4715046 has provoked near political paralysis in a major american city
4715047 i dont think he should get any jail time but they should make an example of him make him do 5 000 hours of community service making speeches cleaning freeways
4715048 hes a real human being and thats the first thing people should look at everyone makes mistakes it happens

4715081 what thoreau did however was to take emerson literally to become the american artist he actually created the house in which to become self reliant seen in this way it becomes apparent that much of the contradiction and inconsistency of walden lies in the fact that it is the physical enacting of a symbolic idea

4715135 to treat the people who are waiting for transplants in wales costs 40m each year
4715136 to give all of transplants would cost around 8m saving in the first year alone something like 30m

4715261 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated

4715264 i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view

4715352 i touched that wall and said thank goodness im thrilled with how ive done and how i competed i couldnt ask for anything more
4715353 im really excited by that race i just wanted to go in and see what i had in me
4715354 i think being a competitor i never let that the three silvers get into my mind and take over i just wanted a good race and focus on what i needed to do
4715355 i think shes handled herself beautifully having to come back after some disappointments and be able to stay focused
4715356 we talked about not thinking about the outcome not thinking about what medal she would get
4715357 we actually used the words like a school yard race just go race because you love to race and you hate to lose and go race the girl you love to race she loves to race margaret and we knew that would be her toughest competitor
4715358 were friends and weve been battling back and forth in what seems like every race

4715362 the push to transform fbi and local police intelligence operations has triggered wider debate over who will be targeted what will be done with the information collected and who will oversee such activities
4715363 critics say preemptive law enforcement in the absence of a crime can violate the constitution and due process
4715364 the new fbi guidelines on their own do not raise alarms
4715365 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4715366 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise

4715369 you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with gods people and members of gods household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the chief cornerstone in him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the lord and in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which god lives by his spirit

4715373 and appoint him a messenger to the children of israel

4715516 and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heavens which i have not commanded then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman which have committed that wicked thing and shalt stone them with stones till they die
4715517 if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is of thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal him but thou shalt surely kill him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god
4715518 he that sacrificeth unto any god save unto the lord only he shall be utterly destroyed
4715519 thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water below
4715520 cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image
4715521 thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain

4715531 now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to god for by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight since through the law comes knowledge of sin
4715532 but now the righteousness of god has been manifested apart from the law although the law and the prophets bear witness to it the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ for all who believe
4715533 then what becomes of our boasting it is excluded by what kind of law by a law of works no but by the law of faith for we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law or is god the god of jews only is he not the god of gentiles also yes of gentiles also since god is one who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith do we then overthrow the law by this faith by no means on the contrary we uphold the law

4715772 begin to believe in the son of god that he will come to redeem his people and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins and that he shall rise again from the dead
4715773 wherefore how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of god save it be through the merits and mercy and grace of the holy messiah who layeth down his life according to the flesh and taketh it again by the power of the spirit that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead being the first that should rise
4715774 and this death of which i have spoken which is the spiritual death shall deliver up its dead which spiritual death is hell wherefore death and hell must deliver up their dead and hell must deliver up its captive spirits and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other and it is by the power of the resurrection of the holy one of israel
4715775 wherefore beloved brethren be reconciled unto him through the atonement of christ his only begotten son and ye may obtain a resurrection according to the power of the resurrection which is in christ and be presented as the first fruits of christ unto god having faith and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh
4715776 for behold he surely must die that salvation may come yea it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the lord
4715777 but there is a resurrection therefore the grave hath no victory and the sting of death is swallowed up in christ
4715778 wherefore it burdeneth my soul that i should be constrained because of the strict commandment which i have received from god to admonish you according to your crimes to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded instead of consoling and healing their wounds and those who have not been wounded instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of god have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds
4715779 think of your brethren like unto yourselves and be familiar with all and free with your substance that they may be rich like unto you but before ye seek for riches seek ye for the kingdom of god and after ye have obtained a hope in christ ye shall obtain riches if ye seek them and ye will seek them for the intent to do good to clothe the naked and to feed the hungry and to liberate the captive and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted
4715780 wherefore my brethren hear me and hearken to the word of the lord for there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife and concubines he shall have none for i the lord god delight in the chastity of women and whoredoms are an abomination before me thus saith the lord of hosts wherefore this people shall keep my commandments saith the lord of hosts or cursed be the land for their sakes for if i will saith the lord of hosts raise up seed unto me i will command my people otherwise they shall hearken unto these things
4715781 wherefore brethren seek not to counsel the lord but to take counsel from his hand for behold ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom and in justice and in great mercy over all his works wherefore beloved brethren be reconciled unto him through the atonement of christ his only begotten son and ye may obtain a resurrection according to the power of the resurrection which is in christ and be presented as the first fruits of christ unto god having faith and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh
4715782 behold my brethren he that prophesieth let him prophesy to the understanding of men for the spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not
4715783 things as they really are and of things as they really will be
4715784 brothers and sisters we dare not hold back the restored gospels declaratives
4715785 things as they really are and things as they really will be
4715786 when we bear testimony we declare the absolute truth of the gospel message
4715787 the jews were a stiffnecked people and they despised the words of plainness and killed the prophets and sought for things that they could not understand
4715788 wherefore because of their blindness which blindness came by looking beyond the mark they must needs fall for god hath taken away his plainness from them and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand because they desired it and because they desired it god hath done it that they may stumble
4715789 intellectual embroidery seems to have been preferred to the whole clothing of the gospel the frills to the fabric

4715791 jacob speaks of people who placed themselves in serious jeopardy in spiritual things because they were unwilling to accept simple basic principles of truth
4715792 some people seem to be embarrassed by the simplicity of the saviors message
4715793 and now my sons remember remember that it is upon the rock of our redeemer who is christ the son of god that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall
4715794 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness
4715795 their hatred was fixed and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild and ferocious and a bloodthirsty people full of idolatry and filthiness feeding upon beasts of prey dwelling in tents and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven and their skill was in the bow and in the cimeter and the ax and many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat and they were continually seeking to destroy us
4715796 and now it came to pass after some years had passed away there came a man among the people of nephi whose name was sherem
4715797 was learned that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people
4715798 brother jacob i have sought much opportunity that i might speak unto you for i have heard and also know that thou goest about much preaching that which ye call the gospel or the doctrine of christ and ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of god and keep not the law of moses which is the right way and convert the law of moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence and now behold i sherem declare unto you that this is blasphemy for no man knoweth of such things for he cannot tell of things to come and after this manner did sherem contend against me
4715799 if there should be a christ i would not deny him but i know that there is no christ neither has been nor ever will be
4715800 then ye do not understand them for they truly testify of christ behold i say unto you that none of the prophets have written nor prophesied save they have spoken concerning this christ
4715801 in that same year there came many prophets prophesying unto the people that they must repent or the great city jerusalem must be destroyed
4715802 ye must press forward with a steadfastness in christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of god and of all men
4715803 and now if the lamb of god he being holy should have need to be baptized by water to fulfil all righteousness o then how much more need have we being unholy to be baptized yea even by water
4715804 enduring faithfully to the end does not just mean coping successfully with our problems or suffering affliction with stamina although some have been called upon to do these things in order to endure
4715805 angels speak by the power of the holy ghost wherefore they speak the words of christ wherefore i said unto you feast upon the words of christ for behold the words of christ will tell you all things what ye should do
4715806 and now my beloved brethren and also jew and all ye ends of the earth hearken unto these words and believe in christ and if ye believe not in these words believe in christ and if ye shall believe in christ ye will believe in these words for they are the words of christ and he hath given them unto me and they teach all men that they should do good
4715807 in the midst of a grand vision of humankind which heaven opened to his view enoch observing both the blessings and challenges of mortality turns his gaze toward the father and is stunned to see him weeping
4715808 how is it that thou canst weep thou art just and merciful and kind forever peace is the habitation of thy throne and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end how is it thou canst weep
4715809 behold these thy brethren they are the workmanship of mine own hands i gave unto them a commandment that they should love one another and that they should choose me their father but behold they are without affection and they hate their own blood wherefore should not the heavens weep seeing these shall suffer
4715810 because of thy faith in christ whom thou hast never before heard nor seen and many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh wherefore go to thy faith hath made thee whole
4715811 and i soon go to the place of my rest which is with my redeemer for i know that in him i shall rest and i rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality and shall stand before him then shall i see his face with pleasure and he will say unto me come unto me ye blessed there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my father amen
4715812 for what could i write more than my fathers have written for have not they revealed the plan of salvation i say unto you yea and this sufficeth me
4715813 there has not been such great faith among all the people of the nephites
4715814 i saw 37 dead civilians near arbiska where the ethiopian forces indiscriminately opened fire on two civilian buses they killed everyone
4715815 there is one focus and it is that this matter must be resolved
4715816 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas
4715817 el mismo criterio que ha empleado bono para reabrir el yak deber a aplicarlo en el caso del cougar

4715821 pondremos toda nuestra fuerza y determinaci n en liberar euskal herria y seguiremos construy ndola como hasta ahora en ese camino no hay atajos la lucha armada es el nico camino
4715822 behold great and marvelous are the works of the lord how unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways and no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him wherefore brethren despise not the revelations of god
4715823 the fulness of the gospel consists in those laws doctrines ordinances powers and authorities needed to enable men to gain the fulness of salvation those who have the gospel fulness do not necessarily enjoy the fulness of gospel knowledge or understand all of the doctrines of the plan of salvation but they do have the fulness of the priesthood and sealing power by which men can be sealed up unto eternal life the fulness of the gospel grows out of the fulness of the sealing power and not out of the fulness of gospel knowledge
4715824 the lord did not mean to convey the impression that every truth belonging to exaltation in the kingdom of god had been delivered to the nephites and was recorded in the book of mormon to be delivered to gentiles and jews in this dispensation neither would this statement imply that every truth belonging to the celestial kingdom and exaltation therein was to be found within the covers of the book of mormon there are many truths belonging to the exaltation that have not been revealed nor will they be revealed to man while he is in mortality we must concede it to be a fact that there are many things related to the exaltation which cannot be received now and do not concern mortal man these truths were not given to the nephites neither can they be given to us in this present day for they do not in any way apply to the needs of the mortal condition nor could we comprehend them while we are in mortality these things belong to the kingdom of god and will be revealed to those who attain to the celestial exaltation
4715825 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known
4715826 we believe all that god has revealed all that he does now reveal and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of god
4715827 thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
4715828 but behold this people had rejected every word of god and they were ripe in iniquity and the fulness of the wrath of god was upon them and the lord did curse the land against them
4715829 that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him
4715830 and now the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the gentiles is that in the latter days when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief yea for the space of many years and many generations after the messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men then shall the fulness of the gospel of the messiah come unto the gentiles and from the gentiles unto the remnant of our seed
4715831 he said there was a book deposited written upon gold plates giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent and the source from whence they sprang
4715832 13 behold i have given unto you my gospel and this is the gospel which i have given unto you that i came into the world to do the will of my father because my father sent me
4715833 11 yea repent and be baptized every one of you for a remission of your sins yea be baptized even by water and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the holy ghost
4715834 and this is my gospel repentance and baptism by water and then cometh the baptism of fire and the holy ghost even the comforter which showeth all things and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom
4715835 and if it so be that ye believe in christ and are baptized first with water then with fire and with the holy ghost following the example of our savior according to that which he hath commanded us it shall be well with you in the day of judgment
4715836 17 wherefore do the things which i have told you i have seen that your lord and your redeemer should do for for this cause have they been shown unto me that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter for the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the holy ghost
4715837 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god 4 nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born 5 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
4715838 blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom i have chosen from among you to minister unto you and to be your servants and unto them i have given power that they may baptize you with water and after that ye are baptized with water behold i will baptize you with fire and with the holy ghost therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized after that ye have seen me and know that i am
4715839 18 and then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life yea ye have entered in by the gate ye have done according to the commandments of the father and the son and ye have received the holy ghost which witnesses of the father and the son unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive
4715840 11 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
4715841 4 and being assembled together with them jesus commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me 5 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
4715842 15 and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning 16 then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost 17 forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
4715843 17 and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost 18 and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized
4715844 13 and the lord god hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men to declare these things to every kindred nation and tongue that thereby whosoever should believe that christ should come the same might receive remission of their sins and rejoice with exceedingly great joy even as though he had already come among them
4715845 for the natural man is an enemy to god and has been from the fall of adam and will be forever and ever unless he yields to the enticings of the holy spirit and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of christ the lord and becometh as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the lord seeth fit to inflict upon him even as a child doth submit to his father
4715846 he cast his eyes round about on the multitude and behold they had fallen to the earth for the fear of the lord had come upon them 2 and they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state even less than the dust of the earth and they all cried aloud with one voice saying o have mercy and apply the atoning blood of christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins and our hearts may be purified for we believe in jesus christ the son of god who created heaven and earth and all things who shall come down among the children of men 3 and it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the spirit of the lord came upon them and they were filled with joy having received a remission of their sins and having peace of conscience because of the exceeding faith which they had in jesus christ who should come according to the words which king benjamin had spoken unto them
4715847 11 and again i say unto you as i have said before that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of god or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love and have received a remission of your sins which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls even so i would that ye should remember and always retain in remembrance the greatness of god and your own nothingness and his goodness and long suffering towards you unworthy creatures and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility calling on the name of the lord daily and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come which was spoken by the mouth of the angel
4715848 that is for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day that ye may walk guiltless before god i would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor every man according to that which he hath such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting the sick and administering to their relief both spiritually and temporally according to their wants
4715849 2 and they all cried with one voice saying yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us and also we know of their surety and truth because of the spirit of the lord omnipotent which has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually
4715850 and now because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of christ his sons and his daughters for behold this day he hath spiritually begotten you for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name therefore ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters
4715851 4 and my soul hungered and i kneeled down before my maker and i cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul and all the day long did i cry unto him yea and when the night came i did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens 5 and there came a voice unto me saying enos thy sins are forgiven thee and thou shalt be blessed 6 and i enos knew that god could not lie wherefore my guilt was swept away
4715852 for said he i have repented of my sins and have been redeemed of the lord behold i am born of the spirit
4715853 17 and it came to pass that as i was thus racked with torment while i was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins behold i remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one jesus christ a son of god to atone for the sins of the world 18 now as my mind caught hold upon this thought i cried within my heart o jesus thou son of god have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death 19 and now behold when i thought this i could remember my pains no more yea i was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more 20 and oh what joy and what marvelous light i did behold yea my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain 21 yea i say unto you my son that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains yea and again i say unto you my son that on the other hand there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy
4715854 25 and the lord said unto me marvel not that all mankind yea men and women all nations kindreds tongues and people must be born again yea born of god changed from their carnal and fallen state to a state of righteousness being redeemed of god becoming his sons and daughters
4715855 44 and nephi and lehi were in the midst of them yea they were encircled about yea they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire yet it did harm them not neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory
4715856 18 i am the light and the life of the world i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end
4715857 i nephi having been born of goodly parents therefore i was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days nevertheless having been highly favored of the lord in all my days yea having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of god therefore i make a record of my proceedings in my days
4715858 1 now my son here is somewhat more i would say unto thee for i perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead 2 behold i say unto you that there is no resurrection or i would say in other words that this mortal does not put on immortality this corruption does not put on incorruption until after the coming of christ 3 behold he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead but behold my son the resurrection is not yet now i unfold unto you a mystery nevertheless there are many mysteries which are kept that no one knoweth them save god himself but i show unto you one thing which i have inquired diligently of god that i might know that is concerning the resurrection
4715859 5 for thus saith the lord i the lord am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end 6 great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory 7 and to them will i reveal all mysteries yea all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old and for ages to come will i make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom 8 yea even the wonders of eternity shall they know and things to come will i show them even the things of many generations 9 and their wisdom shall be great and their understanding reach to heaven and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught 10 for by my spirit will i enlighten them and by my power will i make known unto them the secrets of my will yea even those things which eye has not seen nor ear heard nor yet entered into the heart of man
4715860 114 but great and marvelous are the works of the lord and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed unto us which surpass all understanding in glory and in might and in dominion
4715861 4 and behold i am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me yea and behold i have many kindreds and friends and i have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry 5 nevertheless after all this i never have known much of the ways of the lord and his mysteries and marvelous power i said i never had known much of these things but behold i mistake for i have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power yea even in the preservation of the lives of this people
4715862 7 now when alma had spoken these words zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly for he was convinced more and more of the power of god and he was also convinced that alma and amulek had a knowledge of him for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy 8 and zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently that he might know more concerning the kingdom of god and he said unto alma what does this mean which amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead that all shall rise from the dead both the just and the unjust and are brought to stand before god to be judged according to their works
4715863 9 and now alma began to expound these things unto him saying it is given unto many to know the mysteries of god nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him 10 and therefore he that will harden his heart the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word and he that will not harden his heart to him is given the greater portion of the word until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of god until he know them in full 11 and they that will harden their hearts to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries and then they are taken captive by the devil and led by his will down to destruction now this is what is meant by the chains of hell
4715864 17 and it came to pass after i nephi having heard all the words of my father concerning the things which he saw in a vision and also the things which he spake by the power of the holy ghost which power he received by faith on the son of god and the son of god was the messiah who should come i nephi was desirous also that i might see and hear and know of these things by the power of the holy ghost which is the gift of god unto all those who diligently seek him as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men 18 for he is the same yesterday to day and forever and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world if it so be that they repent and come unto him 19 for he that diligently seeketh shall find and the mysteries of god shall be unfolded unto them by the power of the holy ghost as well in these times as in times of old and as well in times of old as in times to come wherefore the course of the lord is one eternal round
4715865 the most comprehensive outline of the gospel was given by the resurrected savior to the nephites in
4715866 second part of my gospel is put into effect because of the first the atonement
4715867 that as i have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the father
4715868 before we can die we must be born for as death hath passed upon all men
4715869 that as i have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the father to stand before me to be judged of their works whether they be good or whether they be evil and for this cause have i been lifted up therefore according to the power of the father i will draw all men unto me that they may be judged according to their works
4715870 we are born and live to have experiences we live so we can one day die we die so we can be resurrected we are resurrected so we can stand judgment we are judged to determine what kingdom of glory we have qualified to live in for the rest of our eternal existence
4715871 and no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood because of their faith
4715872 as we develop faith in christ we see that he holds the key to our eternal life by learning of him and following him we become like him and therefore able to live eternally in his presence our faith motivates us to action
4715873 now this is the commandment repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name
4715874 baptism is the manifestation that god has established as an observable action indicating the inward conviction to follow christ mormon said therefore there were ordained of nephi men unto this ministry that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water and
4715875 that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the holy ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day
4715876 the holy ghost acts as a guide to help us detect and avoid the pitfalls placed in our pathway by the devil and his angels
4715877 the holy ghost will not only lead you away from spiritual traps of satan but will inspire or prompt you in teaching the gospel and bear witness to the truthfulness of what you are teaching with the holy ghost you cannot fail without it you cannot succeed the holy ghost is the divine influence that fills your soul with joy
4715878 if he endureth to the end behold him will i hold guiltless before my father at that day when i shall stand to judge the world
4715879 often as continue through life we struggle sometimes due to our own choices or even the choices of others
4715880 enduring to the end is not difficult you do it just one day at a time
4715881 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
4715882 astronomical imagery stars constellations sun moon to describe the realized power of god against those who oppose him ie babylon turning back to chapter 24 we see what turns out to be a parallel fulfillment of this prophesy which is the scripture we are examining
4715883 and this we saw also and bear record that an angel of god who was in authority in the presence of god who rebelled against the only begotten son whom the father loved and who was in the bosom of the father was thrust down from the presence of god and the son and was called perdition for the heavens wept over him he was lucifer a son of the morning and we beheld and lo he is fallen is fallen even a son of the morning
4715884 that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth
4715885 yes its a pike no wait i think it s a stick
4715886 no it is a pike however i have foul hooked it
4715887 let me look through my little black book and see what kind of game im in the mood to play

4715889 my boyfriend and i often play table tennis at his place as a change from having sex or watching tv

4715891 i think a lot of guys would like me for a girlfriend
4715892 rub oil all over and slap the shit out of me
4715893 there are many things engraven upon the plates of nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel therefore it is wisdom in me that you should translate this first part of the engravings of nephi and send forth in this work
4715894 wherefore the lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him which purpose i know not but the lord knoweth all things from the beginning wherefore he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men for behold he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words
4715895 but behold i shall take these plates which contain these prophesyings and revelations and put them with the remainder of my record for they are choice unto me and i know they will be choice unto my brethren and i do this for a wise purpose for thus it whispereth me according to the workings of the spirit of the lord which is in me
4715896 and it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness and did build barges in which they did cross many waters being directed continually by the hand of the lord
4715897 behold thou shalt make a hole in the top and also in the bottom and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air and if it be so that the water come in upon thee behold ye shall stop the hole that ye may not perish in the flood
4715898 but i think my ass is nice too yes when i am visiting italy i get back to my familys house after a xl theater 9 53 minute video of kaitlin kaitlin talks to a voluptuous editor in this video and has the most unusual interview of her life youll see what th

4715901 i like to wash my feet because feeling the water cascading down my legs and over my bare feet makes me very wet somewhere else
4715902 and his name shall be called after me and it shall be after the name of his father
4715903 the nearer man approaches perfection the clearer are his views and the greater his enjoyments till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin and like the ancients arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his maker and is caught up to dwell with him
4715904 he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female and he remembereth the heathen and all are alike unto god both jew and gentile
4715905 he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world for he loveth the world even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him wherefore he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation
4715906 but behold it shall come to pass that the lord god shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another that he may show them unto the learned saying read this i pray thee and the learned shall say bring hither the book and i will read them
4715907 and others will he pacify and lull them away into carnal security that they will say all is well in zion yea zion prospereth all is well and thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell
4715908 thou fool that shall say a bible we have got a bible and we need no more bible have ye obtained a bible save it were by the jews know ye not that there are more nations than one know ye not that i the lord your god have created all men and that i remember those who are upon the isles of the sea and that i rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and i bring forth my word unto the children of men yea even upon all the nations of the earth
4715909 awake my sons put on the armor of righteousness shake off the chains with which ye are bound and come forth out of obscurity and arise from the dust
4715910 behold thou art the servant of laban nevertheless thou hast been brought out of the land of jerusalem and i know that thou art a true friend unto my son nephi forever
4715911 adam fell that men might be and men are that they might have joy
4715912 great and abominable church which is the whore of all the earth

4715914 be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance and shall be established in all their 2 nephi 9 2
4715915 that we later come to know as the liahona the liahonas function serves as an illustration of many themes which saturate the chapters to come relating to obtaining and reacting to truth
4715916 and the world because of their iniquity shall judge him to be a thing of naught wherefore they scourge him and he suffereth it and they smite him and he suffereth it yea they spit upon him and he suffereth it because of his loving kindness and his long suffering towards the children of men
4715917 let me look through my little black book and see what kind of game im in the mood to play

4715919 my boyfriend and i often play table tennis at his place as a change from having sex or watching tv
4715920 when he talked to me about posing for nn i thought about it for a few days then suggested that w
4715921 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny

4715923 for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
4715924 even though god is angry his hand of mercy is still extended to israel
4715925 isaiah prophesied that israel would refuse to heed the lord
4715926 for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
4715927 but even after that he was still angry his fist still raised ready to hit them again
4715928 but even then the lords anger will not be satisfied his fist is still poised to strike
4715929 but even this did not stop him from being angry so he kept on punishing them
4715930 in all this his anger is not removed and his hand is still raised to strike
4715931 even then the lord is still angry his hand is still raised against them
4715932 yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised
4715933 except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
4715934 the words which he had often heard his father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into his heart
4715935 the spirit of the lord came upon them and they were filled with joy having received a remission of their sins and having peace of conscience because of the exceeding faith which they had in jesus christ who should come according to the words which king benjamin had spoken unto them
4715936 become the high priest of the church and does immeasurable good preaching and teaching the word of god to the people the sons of mosiah and their actions also have eternal repercussions for both those people they meet and their posterity
4715937 all they could do to repent sufficiently before god that he would take away their stain
4715938 all things have their likeness and all things are created and made to bear record of me both things which are temporal and things which
4715939 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
4715940 when the lord had said these words he showed unto the brother of jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been and also all that would be and he withheld them not from his sight even unto the ends of the earth and there never were greater things made manifest than those which were made manifest unto the brother of jared
4715941 write these things and seal them up and i will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men
4715942 and as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder of his record
4715943 and he went forth and beheld that the words of the lord had all been fulfilled and he finished his record and the hundredth part i have not written and he hid them in a manner that the people of limhi did find them
4715944 nevertheless they did find a land which had been peopled yea a land which was covered with dry bones yea a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed and they having supposed it to be the land of zarahemla returned to the land of nephi
4715945 and they brought a record with them even a record of the people whose bones they had found and it was engraven on plates of ore and for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty four plates which are filled with engravings and they are of pure gold
4715946 there was no one in the land that was able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates
4715947 for i am desirous that these records should be translated into our language for perhaps they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed from whence these records came or perhaps they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed and i am desirous to know the cause of their destruction
4715948 translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of limhi
4715949 now after mosiah had finished translating these records behold it gave an account of the people who were destroyed from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower at the time the lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth yea and even from that time back until the creation of adam
4715950 they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross and for this cause did king mosiah keep them that they should not come unto the world until after christ should show himself unto his people
4715951 now this account did cause the people of mosiah to mourn exceedingly yea they were filled with sorrow nevertheless it gave them much knowledge in the which they did rejoice
4715952 and now i will speak unto you concerning those twenty four plates that ye keep them that the mysteries and the works of darkness and their secret works or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed may be made manifest unto this people yea all their murders and robbings and their plunderings and all their wickedness and abominations may be made manifest unto this people
4715953 therefore when ye are about twenty and four years old i would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people and when ye are of that age go to the land antum unto a hill which shall be called shim and there have i deposited unto the lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people
4715954 behold i have written upon these plates the very things which the brother of jared saw and there never were greater things made manifest than those which were made manifest unto the brother of jared wherefore the lord hath commanded me to write them and i have written them
4715955 i have told you the things which i have sealed up therefore touch them not in order that ye may translate for that thing is forbidden you except by and by it shall be wisdom in god
4715956 these records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick as common tin they were filled with engravings in egyptian characters and bound together in a volume as the leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole the volume was something near six inches in thickness a part of which was sealed
4715957 i took the certificate and put it into my pocket and was just leaving the house when mr anthon called me back and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them i answered that an angel of god had revealed it unto him he then said to me let me see that certificate i accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him when he took it and tore it to pieces saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels and that if i would bring the plates to him he would translate them i informed him that part of the plates were sealed and that i was forbidden to bring them he replied i cannot read a sealed book i left him and went to dr mitchell who sanctioned what professor anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation
4715958 and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned
4715959 but the words which are sealed he shall not deliver neither shall he deliver the book for the book shall be sealed by the power of god and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the lord that they may come forth for behold they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof touch not the things which are sealed for i will bring them forth in mine own due time for i will show unto the children of men that i am able to do mine own work
4715960 they shall not go forth unto the gentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity and become clean before the lord and in that day that they shall exercise faith in me saith the lord even as the brother of jared did that they may become sanctified in me then will i manifest unto them the things which the brother of jared saw even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations saith jesus christ the son of god the father of the heavens and of the earth and all things that in them are
4715961 and i have given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have been sealed even things which were from the foundation of the world and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming if he abide in me and if not another will i plant in his stead
4715962 sadly the book is sealed as contents are being kept from men in this day indeed it is not even now in the possession of mortals it was returned by joseph smith to moroni its divinely appointed custodian nor did even joseph smith either read or translate it we know of no one among mortals since mormon and moroni who have known its contents it was known among the nephites during he nearly two hundred years of their golden era but for the present the book is kept bent us only the portion upon which no seal was placed has been translated why are these plates of mormon sealed the answer is obvious they contain spiritual truths beyond our present ability to receive milk must precede meat and whenever men are offered more of the mysteries of the kingdom than they are prepared to receive it affects them adversely
4715963 of this much we are quite certain when during the millennium the sealed portion of the book of mormon is translated it will give an account of life in preexistence of the creation of all things of the fall and the atonement and the second coming of temple ordinances in their fulness of the ministry and mission of translated beings of life in the spirit world in both paradise and hot of the kingdoms of glory to be inhabited by resurrected being and many such like things
4715964 and it came to pass after i nephi having heard all the words of my father concerning the things which he saw in a vision and also the things which he spake by the power of the holy ghost which power he received by faith on the son of god and the son of god was the messiah who should come i nephi was desirous also that i might see and hear and know of these things by the power of the holy ghost which is the gift of god unto all those who diligently seek him as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men for he is the same yesterday to day and forever and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world if it so be that they repent and come unto him for he that diligently seeketh shall find and the mysteries of god shall be unfolded unto them by the power of the holy ghost as well in these times as in times of old and as well in times of old as in times to come wherefore the course of the lord is one eternal round
4715965 and now alma began to expound these things unto him saying
4715966 for thus saith the lord i the lord am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory and to them will i reveal all mysteries yea all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old and for ages to come will i make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom yea even the wonders of eternity shall they know and things to come will i show them even the things of many generations
4715967 and this is my gospel repentance and baptism by water and then cometh the baptism of fire and the holy ghost even the comforter which showeth all things and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom
4715968 and in that day that they shall exercise faith in me saith the lord even as the brother of jared did that they may become sanctified in me then will i manifest unto them the things which the brother of jared saw
4715969 the words of jacob the brother of nephi which he spake unto the people of nephi
4715970 and now jacob spake many more things to my people at that time nevertheless only these things have i caused to be written for the things which i have written sufficeth me
4715971 wherefore he has given a law and where there is no law given there is no punishment and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the holy one of israel have claim upon them because of the atonement for they are delivered by the power of him
4715972 i will liken his words unto my people and i will send them forth unto all my children for he verily saw my redeemer even as i have seen him
4715973 the book of mormon is a book of scripture it is another testament of jesus christ it is written in biblical language the language of the prophets for the most part it is in easy flowing new testament language with such words as
4715974 then just as you settle in to move comfortably along you will meet a barrier the style of the language changes to old testament prophecy style for interspersed in the narrative are chapters reciting the prophecies of the old testament prophet isaiah they loom as a barrier like a roadblock or a checkpoint beyond which the casual reader one with idle curiosity generally will not go you too may be tempted to stop there but do not do it do not stop reading move forward through those difficult to understand chapters of old testament prophecy even if you understand very little of it move on if all you do is skim and merely glean an impression here and there move on if all you do is look at the words the lord had a purpose in preserving the prophecies of isaiah in the book of mormon notwithstanding they become a barrier to the casual reader those who never move beyond the isaiah chapters miss the personal treasures to be gathered along the way
4715975 and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise
4715976 something that serves as a source or initial stage for subsequent development
4715977 the spirit of god that it came down and wrought upon the man
4715978 i have seen and truly i have studied all books and cosmographies histories chronicles and philosophies and other arts for which our lord with provident hand unlocked my mind sent me upon the seas and gave me fire for the deed those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish mocked me and laughed but who can doubt but that the holy ghost inspired me
4715979 the people of the seed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed
4715980 ressurgence of lamanites but their schism was not based on lineage but on ideology
4715981 if ye be christs then are ye seed and heirs according to the promise
4715982 if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
4715983 the things which this apostle of the lamb shall write are many things which thou hast seen and behold the remainder shalt thou see
4715984 but the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write for the lord god hath ordained the apostle of the lamb of god that he should write them
4715985 and behold i nephi am forbidden that i should write the remainder of the things which i saw and heard wherefore the things which i have written sufficeth me and i have written but a small part of the things which i saw
4715986 god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
4715987 behold their husbands love their wives and their wives love their husbands and their husbands and their wives love their children and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers wherefore how much better are you than they in the sight of your great creator
4715988 it shall be better for the lamanites than for you except ye shall repent for behold they are more righteous than you for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received therefore the lord will be merciful unto them yea he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent
4715989 no contention in the land because of the love of god which did dwell in the hearts of the people and there were no envyings nor strifes nor tumults nor whoredoms nor lyings nor murders nor any manner of lasciviousness and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of god there were no robbers nor murderers neither were there lamanites nor any manner of ites but they were in one the children of christ and heirs to the kingdom of god
4715990 he doeth that which is good among the children of men and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female and he remembereth the heathen and all are alike unto god both jew and gentile
4715991 there are many that harden their hearts against the holy spirit that it hath no place in them wherefore they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught
4715992 why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod know ye not that the lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you and this because of your iniquities behold ye shall go up to jerusalem again and the lord will deliver laban into your hands
4715993 how is it possible that the lord will deliver laban into our hands behold he is a mighty man and he can command fifty yea even he can slay fifty then why not us
4715994 if people are good only because they fear punishment and hope for reward then we are a sorry lot indeed
4715995 obey the commandments or god will send you to hell
4715996 obey the commands and you will get to the celestial kingdom
4715997 i obey because i love the law and want to abide by it

4716004 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4716005 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4716006 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4716007 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4716008 there would have been a lot more wind distributed snow it moves around i heard one guy say it was up to his neck travelling in those sorts of conditions is very difficult

4716035 unborn children who are disabled having the same protection under the law as currently enjoyed by all other children
4716036 a short answer first then a longer one my personal view about that is no i think abortion votes and votes on embryology and votes on all of those things should be free votes they are matters of conscience and on the last embryology bill weve just had i pushed very hard if you remember the prime minister wanted to have whipped votes like they had whipped votes in the house of lords and i said this is wrong this is a conscience issue this is one where mps have got to examine their consciences listen to their constituents and explain their positions and it should always be a free vote so it should always be a free vote my own view is yes i think that we should change the abortion limit down from 24 towards 20 weeks i voted that way and i think it would be right to do that but in the case of parents who have medical evidence that they may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that and i speak as someone i mean ive got a six year old boy who is severely disabled has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic and hes a sweet boy hes a lovely boy ivan and you know it is though incredibly tough bringing up disabled children and i dont want to kind of put myself in the position of saying to other parents youve got to go ahead and have that child or you cant have an abortion or you can do this or you cant do that personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view
4716037 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4716038 when your name gets called they tell you to wait until monday or until next week and the money never comes
4716039 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4716040 the authorities in harare should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy
4716041 dictatorship surrounded by a sea of democracy in our region
4716042 this act is just despicable the lowest of the low
4716043 as cabinet member with responsibility for transport i am already well aware of the struggle staff in that department face as they strive to replace the drain covers and other metal road furniture that is regularly stolen so it can be sold on as scrap
4716044 but to steal the name plates of those who died serving our country in conflict is just deplorable there are no words to describe just how appalling such an action is
4716045 people are really upset about this it would be a pity if when these people are caught if they werent sent to some active service
4716046 all these memorials were put up by local people as their means of commemorating their dead
4716047 and i think thats the important thing to remember that these were very local personal memorials and thats why its painful when these sorts of things happen
4716048 you really would need to be scum of the earth to do such a thing it really is the lowest of the low
4716049 sadly when the price of scrap metal has absolutely rocketed these sorts of things will go on
4716050 a huge amount of work is now needed to ensure all those who had their name plaques stolen have news ones made up and installed on the structure
4716051 the problem is that the welsh assembly committee has decided that it wont support a system of
4716052 now the waiting list in wales for the first time has gone over the 500 mark
4716053 its a disgrace for any prosperous civilised society to say that they have got 500 people who are presumably going to die waiting for a transplant
4716054 to treat the people who are waiting for transplants in wales costs 40m each year
4716055 to give all of transplants would cost around 8m saving in the first year alone something like 30m
4716056 so important more of us who want to help should join the organ donor register
4716057 we would like to say thank you to those that have joined the organ donor register in wales and told their loved ones about their wishes but the challenge does not stop there
4716058 we urge those that want to help to act on their good intentions and sign up now it only takes a few minutes to do so and you could save a life one day
4716059 mrs hart has always made clear she is personally in favour of considering presumed consent as a way of increasing the number of organ donations
4716060 however she recognises that any changes to legislation would require wide ranging consultation and the testing of public opinion as this is a sensitive and emotive issue
4716061 she has asked officials to develop proposals on how we can take forward a public debate in wales on presumed consent
4716062 its always been a goal of mine i never really expected i could do it at this moment
4716063 its just such a dream i heard she is here and it would be really nice to meet her
4716064 if the queen is watching this girl should be made a dame dame rebecca adlington shes my best mate so im allowed to say that

4716069 face up to history and refrain from making the foolish mistake of repeating the unfortunate past again today
4716070 we werent fully confident we stayed in the game but were still not as good as them
4716071 we have to play to our best to have any kind of a chance but we felt like we played quite well today were satisfied with our performance its just a shame to lose
4716072 we didnt think wed be able to beat hong kong we were so excited
4716073 our goal was to win a medal so tomorrow we have to get back to work
4716074 they played better than me thats all i can say
4716075 i had some problems with receiving the serves that made me feel like i was behind and i also dont think i prepared well enough
4716076 i dont care what it is i care what it looks like
4716077 you dont know about my past and i dont have a future figured out and maybe this is going too fast and maybe its not meant to last
4716078 we cannot independently ascertain whether somebody is facing a criminal charge if they are not prepared to provide that information
4716079 after every olympic games we review the team agreements every one of the paragraphs in that agreement is in there for a specific reason
4716080 i know the americans in their agreement require a disclosure of all charges all convictions and that may be a way that we go
4716081 the club and the chairman have been fantastic in trying to get the players in nobody has worked harder than the chairman to get players in
4716082 wed have liked some new players in and we havent got them
4716083 i am concerned yes we need full houses at goodison and what does that the team people have watched everton recently because weve been doing well and the players have been behind that the likes of arteta pienaar jagielka and lescott have come in and gone on to better things
4716084 the players ask me regularly about whats happening and thats because we have a good relationship
4716085 there has been money there but the availability of the players hasnt been there for many different reasons things just havent fallen in the transfer market for us we have got to bring in several players here and there are funds to do that but you have to do your sums
4716086 i dont think i should have to lower my standards as regards the players we want but i might have to
4716087 im not feeling sorry for myself i understand the situation im a loyal person and ill back the club to back me i wont change how i go about things
4716088 ive started to build something here ive been here six years and to me now that doesnt seem that long its actually quite a short time

4716095 there are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still
4716096 every day you may make progress every step may be fruitful yet there will stretch out before you an ever lengthening ever ascending ever improving path you know you will never get to the end of the journey but this so far from discouraging only adds to the joy and glory of the climb

4716104 the breadth of the sigg collection offers a window not only onto the stunning changes in chinese art in the past decades but also onto the equally stunning changes that have taken place in chinese society and culture we are thrilled that uli sigg has made his collection available for this landmark exhibition
4716105 my experience in china since the late seventies first in the business world by establishing the first joint venture company between china and the west and later in the diplomatic arena has made me keenly aware of both the rapid changes in contemporary china and the fact that nothing was being done on an institutional level to preserve or document these developments in the artistic realm
4716106 therefore i determined early on in my collecting that my goal would be to collect as much for china as for myself someday when the conditions are right i am prepared to return this cultural legacy to the people of china
4716107 ronnie is making good progress in his battle with booze
4716108 his family hoped his fling with eka happened because he fell off the wagon
4716109 sadly for them he has genuinely fallen head over heels for her
4716110 hes like a lovesick puppy and cant shake off his teenage like infatuation
4716111 canciller a considera improcedente asilo del se or mario uribe escobar
4716112 la hist rica instituci n del asilo no debe ser desvirtuada
4716113 por el delito de concierto para delinquir consistente en concertarse para promover grupos armados al margen de la ley autodefensas o paramilitares
4716114 la medida de aseguramiento contra el senador mario uribe me duele asumo este dolor con patriotismo sin mengua en el cumplimiento de mis responsabilidades
4716115 ajeno a la voluntad del consulado y del gobierno de costa rica no se entregar n documentos el d a de hoy
4716116 no puede ser que personas que est n siendo buscadas por los organismos judiciales recurran a una figura como la del asilo pol tico para cubrir cr menes que deben ser investigados y sancionados por la justicia colombiana
4716117 pues que se sacrifique la familia de ingrid porque si toca que la maten que la maten que maten a todos los rehenes con tal de que maten a todos los guerrilleros
4716118 i had to deal with it on my way up now im dumping it all on you
4716119 when you earn more respekts you can get more free clothing blah blah blah
4716120 an arms race that few can even hope to compete in much less win
4716121 embracing open source development crowd sourcing content targeting different platforms such as the web or mobile phones all of these are valid
4716122 they arent responding to the changing market because they dont understand how to work things like web technologies into their current income models
4716123 so instead they keep doing the same things just more of them and with higher budgets
4716124 if you think its just because you live thinking is living
4716125 the church that is man managed instead of god governed is doomed to failure a ministry that is college trained but not spirit filled works no miracles
4716126 we are suffering today from a weak pulpit and pointless preaching we have clever speakers but few prophets we have too few fearless speakers for god and the truth we have the best paid and best educated ministry but too much of it is popular flabby and insipid and stirs neither heaven nor hell we sadly lack men to whom the pulpit is a throne of power we have too many flying kites of superficial thinking instead of men of fire whose utterances burn and whose sermons scorch the wicked we have too many who coddle the saints and fail to collar the sinner
4716127 omg 3 month holidays what am i going to do
4716128 when i did that last half stroke i thought it cost me the race
4716129 it seems im in sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see its real im just glad its real
4716130 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer had second
4716131 it was a real honor for me to race michael phelps and to have all eyes on me as the guy who could possibly do it
4716132 so im enjoying this moment i wish it was a gold medal but im happy with the silver
4716133 there hasnt been an error in the timing system i ever heard of
4716134 if you dream as big as you can dream anything is possible
4716135 i kept my eyes on michael but it was a race with myself
4716136 but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
4716137 i wanted to try and get out into the open water i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
4716138 phelps swam so fast it is my honor to compete with him
4716139 i had to force myself to put it out of my head
4716140 the greatest relay swimmer of all time the last 50 meters were absolutely incredible
4716141 i was going to need a strong breaststroke when we all turned together at the wall then ryan turned dead even at the 200m so i knew i was going to have to overpower them
4716142 theyre talking about 30 000 plants right now but theyre still counting
4716143 conduct that may be penalized under the tra and or prohibited under the ear includes
4716144 amidst the mists and coldest frosts with stoutest wrists and loudest boasts he thrusts his fist against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts
4716145 i need not your needles theyre needless to me for kneading of noodles twere needless you see but did my neat knickers but need to be kneed i then should have need of your needles indeed
4716146 we will do pretty much the same things we did tuesday
4716147 the older quarterbacks wont be live but well get some live scrimmage work in
4716148 that was just the first scrimmage but we still have a lot to sharpen up
4716149 as far as chemistry is going we are making pretty good progress and we feel like we are well on the way to getting where we want to be
4716150 we still have some work to do but we have an amazing running back eugene jarvis we have wide receivers who can make plays and stretch the field
4716151 there are a lot of opportunities on our side of the ball and we will sharpen up and be a really good offense
4716152 we have a contingency plan in place to cover the ohio association of public school employees should they choose to strike
4716153 im doing what i can in some small way to help john mccain become president
4716154 i believe he has two qualities essential to becoming president
4716155 our next president has to have a lot of guts secondly he has the ability to bring people together from both sides of the aisle
4716156 our method is to make phone calls and knock on doors
4716157 weve had very successful events in ohio i dont think well raise as much money as democratic challenger barack obama but i dont think well need to
4716158 i think they are the ideal organization to take control of alpha
4716159 especially those at a low economic level i think they will do a great job with that
4716160 we have similar missions and serve the same people in our community
4716161 its a great gift to habitat this going to be a good thing even though we wont continue with the store well continue on with a similar mission
4716162 it is our desire to continue on with their endeavors
4716163 were shutting one door but opening many doors to the community
4716164 they will honor our name were very excited about this
4716165 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4716166 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4716167 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4716168 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4716169 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4716170 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4716171 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4716172 my music and my clothes are really a reflection of who i am and its been really cool to see that resonate with my fans
4716173 every ten years or so the united states needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall just to show the world we mean business
4716174 believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality
4716175 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
4716176 la forma en la que los juegos comenzaron fueron virtualmente todos casual
4716177 me gusta hablar de como en 1983 fue el punto de ruptura en que los jeugos fueron de ser casual a ser hardcore
4716178 se volvieron violentos y complejos la violencia perdio a las mujeres y la complejidad al jugador casual
4716179 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
4716180 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
4716181 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
4716182 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
4716183 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
4716184 dip his hand in to the grease vat and pull it out before getting burned

4716194 i get really turned on when i bring my legs up to my face and then play wit
4716195 i like to wash my feet because feeling the water cascading down my legs and over my bare feet makes me very wet somewhere else

4716202 rub oil all over and slap the shit out of me amp quot
4716203 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4716204 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies

4716209 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4716210 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4716211 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4716212 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4716213 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4716214 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4716215 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4716216 look theres a problem here and our peacemakers are not the ones to solve it help us to put together an international force to secure community integrity of these minority peoples
4716217 i forgive you you gave me hell but i will give you a w in return
4716218 i believe in god father almighty creator of heaven and earth
4716219 nafa convocation 2008 guest of honour mr benson puah ceo the esplanade co ltd
4716220 medvedev confirmed that he would also sign the accord and that russia would scrupulously respect the engagements in the accord notably those concerning the withdrawal of russian forces
4716221 she said she would fax the document to the russians
4716222 but i dont expect anything from the russians this is the russian tactic to drag their feet
4716223 i dont think any major decisions will be made on this on the basis of a fax
4716224 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4716225 this is just another informational provocation on georgias part russian units have not entered borjomi
4716226 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters
4716227 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4716228 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4716229 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4716230 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4716231 if the current regime was not supposed to survive modernization its proving very adaptable
4716232 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4716233 i think hes a major figure definitely americas next billy graham
4716234 neither can be harmed by this both will benefit from this
4716235 pastor rick feels that a lot of these debates produce more heat than light and he wanted to give the candidates the opportunity for more long form answers
4716236 when you try to do a middle ground youve got enemies on both sides
4716237 i dont know whats going to happen with the evangelical vote nobodys ever predicted it correctly and i certainly wouldnt try to do that
4716238 its always been misunderstood to be a monolith it isnt
4716239 when i chopped the last stroke i thought it cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try and get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4716240 it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4716241 losing by one hundredth of a second is the most difficult thing to accept especially in an olympic final
4716242 if its up to me i would drop the protest
4716243 im shocked but im really happy there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4716244 this is what the results showed on the electronic board
4716245 there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles
4716246 when people say things like that it fires me up
4716247 if anyone wants to make comments thats fine i will always welcome them and i will give my response in the water
4716248 i looked at the video footage from omega and it was very clear the serbian swimmer had second behind michael phelps one was stroking phelps the other gliding
4716249 according to our rules we use an automatic system and in this case the omega system was in perfect order and perfect condition for this race
4716250 after seeing the video i met with the serbian officials and team leaders and offered them the chance to see the race for themselves after the competition
4716251 the serbian team were satisified and agreed and they had the chance to look at the video to be sure the decision is correct
4716252 all i can say is that i raced as hard as i could and swam my best the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4716253 i hope i can go a little bit quicker tomorrow
4716254 i didnt get much sleep last night and was lying in bed at 11 30 waiting to
4716255 hopefully i can go a little quicker and if a medal comes thats great if it doesnt it doesnt really matter
4716256 als ich einmal zu besuch in berlin war bin ich bei der suche nach einer toilette am alexanderplatz fast verzweifelt
4716257 die hygienestandards der toilette die ich nach langer suche gefunden hatte lie en zu w nschen brig aus diesem erlebnis ist dann die idee entstanden eine toilettensuchmaschine mit bewertungssystem zu erfinden

4716264 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4716265 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4716266 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4716267 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4716268 there would have been a lot more wind distributed snow it moves around i heard one guy say it was up to his neck travelling in those sorts of conditions is very difficult
4716269 in the southern alps you have got altitude and high mountains near the ocean you get a lot of serious snowfalls we get 50 metres of cumulative snowfall a year here
4716270 they dug in and they had plenty of food and supplies

4716274 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4716275 on the last tour they played to nearly 200 000 people in manchester and the shows were amazing this is the first leg of a very long tour
4716276 i am sure they must have a surprise for manchester
4716277 amazing but true cat stories is a collection of stories about feline antics illustrated in vivid 8 bit color by true mspaint artists stolen pants pooped on veterinarians fur on fire foretold seizures and much more this book was entirely written by the anonymous crowd all stories and illustrations were submitted by workers on amazons mechanical turk i selected edited and laid out the stories in a short but sweet coffee table book the idea for this book was born in terminal a at washington dulles where i was stranded for some hours in late july to spend my time i posted the following two tasks on mturk 1 write at least one paragraph about a funny unbelievable or otherwise memorable incident involving your cat 2 sketch a cat with or without an environment and toys before i got out of that terminal it was already clear that the submissions were too good to keep to myself

4716279 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4716280 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4716281 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4716282 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4716283 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4716284 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4716285 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4716286 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4716287 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4716288 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4716289 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4716290 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4716291 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4716292 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4716293 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4716294 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4716295 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4716296 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4716297 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4716298 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4716299 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4716300 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4716301 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4716302 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4716303 cuando te pones sus zapatos no puedes dejar de mirarte los pies
4716304 when you wear her shoes you can t stop watching at your feet

4716306 the barroom is filled with the joy of making old friends
4716307 wij zijn ons bewust van die leemte in de wetgeving
4716308 bij de hervatting moeten we misschien eens rond de tafel gaan zitten om het probleem aan te pakken nu al werken we samen met test aankoop aan een wet die gedupeerden de mogelijkheid geeft samen gerechtelijke acties te ondernemen in dergelijke burgerlijke geschillen

4716325 were saving on gas saving on food and the kids want to be here all day anyway
4716326 they had friends that stayed and they wanted to stay so they talked me into it
4716327 it saves you from driving home late at night from the fair with kids
4716328 it really makes it nice to be here and stay off the road
4716329 in a sudden rain storm its amazing how many friends you have
4716330 i think a lot of its for convenience because a lot of parents work
4716331 i think its a good experience for them because they are basically on barn duty till they go to bed at night
4716332 we spend our night at the fair and then we dont have to spend 20 minutes to a half hour driving here
4716333 not all the kids stay overnight because its good to get to sleep in your own bed so they take turns
4716334 when i say we im speaking for these 400 plus people whose names ive just handed you
4716335 expedite the processing of voter registrations received during the week immediately preceding the voter registration deadline
4716336 during the 10 day period after the deadline if the registrant will be eligible to vote
4716337 to develop procedures to immediately register the applicant and issue an absentee ballot
4716338 reserving the right to delay registration and immediate absentee voting if a board is not satisfied as to the validity of the application and the applicants qualifications
4716339 we will defend every qualified voters right to cast a ballot but we will not stand by and allow democrats to create illegal loopholes that allow the system to be exploited we are asking the secretary of state to revoke her previous directive and issue a clear and uniform statewide standard prohibiting same day registration
4716340 we will follow the law as the republicans wrote it
4716341 and when we do more democrats will vote more ohioans will vote and i think our democracy will be better for it

4716343 the ohio democratic party will fight back aggressively against these shameless attempts by the republican party to intimidate voters deceive them about the elections process and repress voter turnout in this historic election year
4716344 our hope is that everyone will take a step back and work together in voters best interests to find solutions to these questions rather than fight it out with press releases and lawsuits
4716345 id been thinking about a judgeship for a number of years and when judge miller ran five years ago and said it would be his last term i decided to run for it
4716346 hes the type of person we need on the bench hes got the great character understanding and respect and his decision making is the type you expect of a judge
4716347 bill is a great family man and hes got that temperament to be a judge which is a great asset of all our judges

4716353 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4716354 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4716355 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4716356 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4716357 i guess that was kind of my goal by the end of the year
4716358 the best thing about jacob is his mental side and figuring people out

4716377 die problematik die wir heute in deutschland haben ist zum einen mal verunsicherung dass leute nicht wissen was sie kaufen sollen einfach weil auch die politik keine eindeutige aussage macht und zum anderen mal nat rlich auch das vorhandene geld es ist alles teurer geworden und am ende berlegen viele leute ob sie ihr altes auto noch ein paar jahre behalten ich glaube dass das das eigentliche problem ist das problem ist nicht dass die leute kein interesse mehr am automobil haben

4716392 i have seen the rise in the number of bi competency centers that are being mandated as part of the strategic vision of organizations in parallel with the emphasis on driver based planning which combines reporting and planning with rolling forecasts corevision fits nicely into this niche

4716399 it new delhis view is not suggested it is clearly said that the isi is fermenting trouble in kashmir they have been fermenting trouble in kashmir for years again you have a situation where part of it is outside particularly from pakistan and the other side has been doing so for decades not just the past few weeks
4716400 similarly there is evidence that the isi has been active on the afghanistan border recently there were accusations about the isi involvement in the kabul indian embassy attack on july 7 i mean these are just tip of the iceberg its interesting now its not the isi that is possibly doing something new its the fact that the international community accepts its and can say it publicly and thats the major difference not the action themselves
4716401 the question is very bizarre to start with in a sense that politicalnstability is already there but i mean dont forget that pervez musharraf himself is part of this political instability by staying on he clearly ignored the result of the february 2008 election and therefore creating frustration in the population so his departure is likely to lessen the tension not increase it
4716402 to an extent it is true that musharraf had at least contributed to the significant improvement of relations between the two and for a long time there is a new perception that his departure would be a problem for that very reason at the same time this is not the impeachment of musharraf or the beginning of the process which has started the deterioration of relations with india
4716403 what we have seen since the beginning of the summer resumption of the situation on the attack of all kind in a sense including their embassy in afghanistan so the deterioration was there anyway it would not be changed by the impeachment process itself

4716420 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4716421 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4716422 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4716423 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4716424 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4716425 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4716426 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4716427 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4716428 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4716429 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4716435 i totally refute any accusation of abuse or torture of the prisoners
4716436 there is no hatred and only camaraderie in these photos i entirely reject mr mccains and others accusations that we mistreated or tortured them no other people on this earth have ever treated prisoners better than we did
4716437 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
4716438 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
4716439 i have a wonderful idea lets move some place that is so cold that we will never be able to go outside without 100 lbs of clothing and we will never see the gournd or eat fruit again
4716440 good move east thats what the middle of the countrys for people who gave up on their dreams
4716441 and they say things like aw this place is great but i like seasons so do i thats why i live in a place that skips the ones

4716445 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4716446 an actual discovery of these wrecks would offer unprecedented information on the exploration of canadas north and the discovery of the northwest passage a critical piece of our shared history and important to present and future generations
4716447 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4716448 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4716449 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4716450 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4716451 there would have been a lot more wind distributed snow it moves around i heard one guy say it was up to his neck travelling in those sorts of conditions is very difficult
4716452 in the southern alps you have got altitude and high mountains near the ocean you get a lot of serious snowfalls we get 50 metres of cumulative snowfall a year here
4716453 they dug in and they had plenty of food and supplies
4716454 zionists are neither jews nor christians nor muslims they are followers of no monotheist faith they are merely members of a criminal party
4716455 we proposed that a referendum needs to be held at the entire land of palestine so that its whole residents including the jews the christians and the muslims would be able to decide their own countrys fate
4716456 this proposal is made based on the charter of the united nations the international laws and the rules of democracy but those that claim to be the standard bearers of democracy do not accept this solution
4716457 but i humbly tell you that the expiry date of that regime is over now that it is segregated in the world that the world nations and many governments are fed up with it and that it is left alone even in its own region
4716458 the best thing to do for those that established this regime is to de establish it and to clean the mess
4716459 at the beginning of the press conference you spoke of the hard times that the world nations are suffering from
4716460 as we see the neo colonialists are now oppressing the peoples of afghanistan iraq and other vast regions in the world those powers posses weapons of mass destruction and they commit all types of mischief against the mankind the same posers have found fault with the nuclear program of iran and are after imposing mounting pressure against you how do you evaluate such double standards
4716461 they are opposed to the advancement of countries like iran and turkey they wish us to remain dependent on big powers for good they are the enemies of our development programs otherwise the nuclear program is nothing but a pretext for them
4716462 fifteen years ago when there was no sign of the nuclear program the united states unilaterally imposed sanctions against us under such conditions that we had just got rid of the imposed war that the western governments had intrigued against us and we were thinking about reconstruction
4716463 let me narrate a memory for you tow years ago we discussed the nuclear issue at the us foreign relations council
4716464 the members of that council had a meeting with me they asked many questions and i replied ot all of them at the end one of them said we confirm that what you are doing is legal and within your rights range you have the right to be benefited from the nuclear energy and you have not breached any of your commitments but there is a problem if we would permit you to take advantage of the nuclear energy tomorrow turkey saudi arabia and egypt too would demand the same what could we do with them then
4716465 i told them what is wrong with that if it is a right for entire nations permit them to use it and if it is not do not use it yourselves either of course they had no convincing response basically they do not want to permit such countries as turkey iran and egypt to become advanced countries

4716481 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4716482 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4716483 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4716490 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4716491 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4716492 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4716493 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4716494 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4716495 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4716496 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4716497 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4716498 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4716499 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4716500 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4716501 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4716502 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4716503 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4716504 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4716505 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4716506 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4716507 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4716508 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4716509 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4716510 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4716511 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4716512 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

4716518 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4716519 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4716520 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4716521 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4716522 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4716523 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4716524 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4716525 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

4716553 the classic shrimp toast with a black sesame crust part of our dimsum seafood trio
4716554 seared scallops are garnished with ginger green onions and cilnatro then drizzled with sizzling sesame oil and soy sauce theyre served on a nest of cilantro and sesame flavored chow mein part of our dimsum seafood trio
4716555 masago fish roe provides pops of sea goodness on lap cheung chinese sausage and cilantro fried rice made hors by serving in wonton cups part of our dimsum seafood trio
4716556 this is a simple easy to cook mushroom dish made with the simplest of ingredients it has a distinctive blend of tastes it is rich filling and at the same time not high in calorie content
4716557 phirni is rice pudding made with powdered rice sugar and milk i dont know why i tried adding crushed rose petals but i am glad i did prepare this sweet delight when you are feeling down just like i did it acts like a mood shifter for me
4716558 this soup is thick rich velvety in texture and tasty labna is an easy to make flavored yogurt which goes perfectly with this little sweet soup this is perfect little sweet and little tinge of sour flavor combo
4716559 hilsa or ilish what we call it in bengali is a seasonal fish found in the rivers during monsoon so lots of preparation are there but this one is special at home we all love the taste and the tenderness of this dish and its very easy to cook and that makes it all even more popular
4716560 its a quick dip chutney that i came up with while trying to use up the spring onions in my fridge
4716561 i tried chicken with capsicum for the first and i had leftover capsicum of all the three colours
4716562 after hating cooked courgettes my whole childhood they turned into one of my favourite veggies talking about veggies why dont we forget bread crumbs for a while and coat the cakes into veggie crumbs
4716563 i tried making this curry with leftover puree which we get after straining soup check out my post to know more about the recipe
4716564 this post is all about red and panner capsicum curry garnished with heartshape cottage cheese and capsicum thus the name dilpasand
4716565 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4716566 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4716567 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4716568 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4716569 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4716570 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4716571 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4716572 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4716573 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4716574 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4716575 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4716576 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4716577 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4716578 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4716579 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4716586 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4716587 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4716588 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4716589 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4716590 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4716591 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4716592 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4716593 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4716594 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4716595 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4716596 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4716597 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4716598 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4716599 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4716600 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4716601 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4716602 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4716603 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4716604 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4716605 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4716606 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4716607 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4716608 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4716609 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4716610 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4716611 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4716612 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4716613 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4716614 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4716615 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4716616 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4716617 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4716618 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4716619 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4716620 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4716621 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4716622 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4716623 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4716624 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4716625 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4716626 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4716627 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4716628 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4716629 there are plenty of alternatives to label such people outside of pro wrestling we seek to restrict the usage of the word terrorist to our industry
4716630 the term axis of evil really suits the wrestling industry it has a sinister ring to it
4716631 this stable will be the most evil and terrible force in the whole of our promotion striking fear and terror into the hearts of opponents and using dirty tricks to win matches
4716632 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4716633 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4716634 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4716635 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4716636 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4716637 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4716638 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4716639 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4716684 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4716685 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4716686 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4716687 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4716688 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4716689 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4716690 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4716691 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4716692 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community

4716707 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4716708 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4716709 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4716710 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4716717 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4716718 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4716719 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4716720 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4716721 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4716722 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4716723 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4716724 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4716725 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4716726 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4716727 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4716728 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4716729 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4716730 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4716731 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4716732 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4716733 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4716734 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4716735 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4716736 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4716737 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4716738 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4716739 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4716740 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4716741 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4716742 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4716743 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4716744 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4716745 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4716746 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4716747 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4716748 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4716749 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4716750 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4716751 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4716752 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4716753 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4716754 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4716755 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4716756 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4716757 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4716758 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4716759 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4716760 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4716761 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4716762 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4716763 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4716764 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed

4716781 ya bagaimanapun yang dihadapi alhamdulillah hanya allah yang maha mengetahui segala kegaiban
4716782 ya allah aku harus kuat dan tabah sikap baik kepada suami adalah jalan hidupku
4716783 saat ia sudah berganti pakaian sungguh kecantikannya semakin berkilau tak pernah kubayangkan ada wanita secantik ini di dunia ini
4716784 entah kenapa aku begitu mengantuk padahal sebelumnya aku betul betul ingin begadang belum pernah aku tertidur sepulas ini sampai akhirnya aku mendapati istriku tidak lagi disampingku aku bangkit dengan mata masih mengantuk untuk mencari istriku mungkin ia malu sehingga memilih tidur di kamar lain aku segera membuka pintu kamar sebelah gelap sepi tak ada suara sama sekali aku berjalan perlahan khawatir membangunkannya kulihat wajah bersinar di tengah kegelapan keindahan yang ajaib dan menggetarkan jiwaku bukan keindahan fisik karena ia tengah berada di peraduan ibadahnya ya allah sungguh ia tidak meninggalkan shalat malamnya termasuk di malam pengantin kupertajam penglihatanku ia rukuk sujud dan membaca ayat ayat panjang ia rukuk dan sujud lama sekali ia berdiri di hadapan rabbnya dengan kedua tangan terangkat sungguh pemandangan terindah yang pernah kusaksikan ia amat cantik dalam kekhusyuannya lebih cantik dari saat memakai pakaian pengantin dan pakaian tidurnya sungguh kini aku betul betul mencintainya dengan seluruh jiwa ragaku

4716786 op de olympische spelen en bij een gentleman sport als tennis moet je zoiets melden fernando keek me recht in de ogen en zei niets
4716787 dit is een teleurstellende exit als je niet alleen de wedstrijd maar ook een beetje het vertrouwen in je tegenstander verliest
4716788 als ik 100 procent zeker was geweest had ik het toegegeven maar ik wist het niet zeker
4716789 omdat ik het toch nog een keer wil proberen als ik in goeden doen ben
4716790 niet om als excuus aan te voeren maar ik wil toch het nog een keer op de baan proberen als ik in topvorm ben
4716791 dit is mijn stijl en daarmee ben ik op de weg en in het veld succesvol geweest waarom zou ik die veranderen
4716792 i touched that wall and said thank goodness im thrilled with how ive done and how i competed i couldnt ask for anything more
4716793 im really excited by that race i just wanted to go in and see what i had in me

4716795 at the short course world championships in february coventry won four golds adding to her gold silver and bronze at the last olympics
4716796 i think shes handled herself beautifully having to come back after some disappointments and be able to stay focused
4716797 we talked about not thinking about the outcome not thinking about what medal she would get
4716798 we actually used the words like a school yard race
4716799 krisztina egerszegi of hungary held the world record of 2 06 62 for 16 years before coventry lowered the mark to 2 06 39 in february hoelzer then set the standard at 2 06 09 at the u s trials last month
4716800 were friends and weve been battling back and forth in what seems like every race
4716801 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4716802 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud it will be exciting back home

4716809 apparently my brain is slowest on the up take with all this that has come to pass
4716810 youre fine someone who has done what youve done and in such a short amount of time well its like youre a war veteran it would seem to me that your brain needs a debriefing to get fully up to speed on whats occurred
4716811 he will be missed and im sorry to hear hes passed on
4716812 he had a round face with a blank expression but his eyes were always twinkling
4716813 he did a lot of work on behalf on the westlake village yacht club
4716814 much smaller and only had two boats of every kind
4716815 we were very big with the kids and all of us would jump in the boats and away wed go across the lake bill was great with the kids
4716816 our children grew up with his red light green light game and thats how they were encouraged to drink their milk
4716817 you better eat that there are starving kids in africa

4716824 but im hiding in a basement at my relatives im scared
4716825 they asked me things like are you prepared to be celibate
4716826 i wanted to get away from everything for a while
4716827 i was hoeing turnips and i heard the voice of god saying what are you doing here i dont want you to hoe turnips i want you to be a priest in my church
4716828 she told the bishop get him out of there because hes killing himself
4716829 i loved him in the way you love a wonderful priest
4716830 i said you have a lovely view i wouldnt mind living here
4716831 they asked me things like are you prepared to be celibate

4716837 we have to look at alternative ways of skinning the cat

4716839 it would be too trivial to put it simply down to what indigenous people term as rere or the informal synonym lamu it is deeper than that
4716840 i have observed indigenous males very closely on this aspect and i am ashamed at their general lack of knowledge integrity courage and leadership an appropriate phrase is taken from the islands of gau lailai na dina
4716841 worse when someone does speak up especially a woman they dont like it because they fear repercussions or it offends their ego
4716842 i am just glad i wasnt alive thousand of years ago in my ancestors shoes to lead any of those gutless wonders to any battle id probably kill myself first
4716843 i know a former leader working on forming a new party based on the same ideals
4716844 he is a leader i am happy to follow come what may and i have asked him to discuss various options with the leaders of the nfp
4716845 this party can distinguish itself in a great way as one that has never planned condoned or benefited from a coup

4716848 my gut tells me the outcome would have been different but my gut also tells me that is irrelevant
4716849 the biggest problem we had with it was the potential for food equipment contamination
4716850 they need a sacrificial lamb to prove that they were right all along on terror
4716851 he was an average swimmer and he progressed the more he progressed the better he got at it i never thought he would go this far

4716855 i made 6 ounces of fat today bring on the glaciers
4716856 i am very pleased with the verdict and very proud of barbara for taking this case to the jury
4716857 i felt i did the best thing when i fired barbara the best thing for this office and for the community
4716858 this is an office that stepped outside of its proper role as a prosecutors office
4716859 a jury saw that they were making a number of defenses that were false
4716860 our intention is those messages of hope will forever surround those seeking solace
4716861 i feel its very important almost equally important to the physical aspect of healing
4716862 theres proof that people heal faster if they have the spiritual and emotional aspects involved in their recovery
4716863 may gods spirit comfort all who enter here heal them and bring them peace
4716864 god is our rock and fortress our ever present help in trouble
4716865 whether they know it or not there is a path to healing thats beyond what doctors can provide
4716866 loveable st anthony in your kindness teach us how to pray amen
4716867 i put my hands on him and saw there was nothing there
4716868 if i ever felt helpless in my life that was it
4716869 there was no intention to harm others located at the scene
4716870 i can confirm a craig robinson was charged with two felonies possession of a controlled substance and misdemeanor dui
4716871 if youre having a tough day scream fcuk off and go to sleep thats what i did
4716872 i might be the only person here whos reacting to it
4716873 the only thing ive noticed is a little haze when i look at mount rainier
4716874 its usually such a nice view from here but yeah its definitely obscured
4716875 the wind is very very low speed during these events
4716876 and it typically comes out of the north and its affected by geography and geology of the area that air mass moves down the mountains and ends up in the enumclaw area
4716877 our levels are nothing like youd experience in houston or southern california
4716878 i think liam and justin were sitting around talking about it one day and they set out to do it
4716879 they are both very fast and i think they inspired other guides to try
4716880 im going to try and take it back next year
4716881 those guys and chad kellogg got me excited about trying it
4716882 everybody likes to test themselves and its fun to see so many people doing that this summer
4716883 i think its great that 20 something years later the young guides are still doing the same thing on their days off
4716884 i always thought with the right gear somebody could do it in less than five hours
4716885 its personal and its a friendly competition because the people all know each other
4716886 i dont think anybody will be awake at that hour
4716887 wir sind stark daran interessiert dass wir eine solche verbindung bekommen

4716897 let me look through my little black book and see what kind of game im in the
4716898 we were good enough to win it but we made some poor choices at times
4716899 we blew at least three decent try scoring opportunities and missed a couple of key shots at goal which would have given us a handy buffer 200m breaststroke
4716900 if you cant find it on your own doorstep where do you expect to go to find it
4716901 attraction is the dolphin show here a small species of dolphins are put through there paces in a muddy pond balancing balls and splashing the audience its all rather embarrassing really
4716902 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
4716903 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
4716904 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
4716905 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio
4716906 it is hard to tell if the water scheme is the device being used to seize the land or if the wind turbine scheme is the means by which he will fund the water scheme

4716910 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
4716911 so thats just going to have to remain a mystery for all those dylanologists
4716912 my reflex action was to say thank you very much but no it had been so many years that id shut the door but the way he presented it was what was it like as a young girl to come from the family i came from and end up in the village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes that was something to think about then my son said people have been writing a version of you for years its time you told the real one it suddenly made sense
4716913 when he started out as a performer he was playful a combination of woody guthrie and harpo marx with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient
4716914 he used that playfulness to draw the audience in with the passing of time the technique was no longer required the audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage a sense of humour however was always his strong suit
4716915 right from the start i couldnt take my eyes off her
4716916 she was the most erotic thing id ever seen she was fair skinned and golden haired full blood italian we started talking and my head started to spin she was just my type
4716917 situations have ended sad relationships have all been bad mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
4716918 i felt i was reading a book of revelations lessons warnings
4716919 even though picasso was a much older man than bob and had experienced a lot more their personalities were so similar that it was astounding
4716920 he sat still and quiet didnt even jiggle his leg
4716921 people ask was this song written for you well i could say this and that i could make a list but if you really listen to those songs theyre somewhat like fiction hes written something coming from his life but he sets it in a fiction maybe using another characters voice
4716922 i can recognise things its like looking at a diary it brings it all back and whats hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go his mine anybodys so from the perspective of an older person looking back you enjoy them but also think of them as the pain of youth the loneliness and the struggle that youth is or may be
4716923 i could see that he was an artist at work
4716924 i was a young girl of my time i was shy and timid and i would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do if a girl did that it would mean that she was alone she wasnt with somebody she was an easy woman it would take a lot of courage to do it and when you did it you took a chance
4716925 he had this intensity about him and you got sucked in
4716926 i certainly felt that as his girlfriend i disappeared and became a nonentity even if he didnt see me that way thats what happened that was always a struggle
4716927 there are people who say that he was not a good guy he was manipulative he was this that and the other i tend to see it as you are what you are he could be a shit like anybody else but a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted because nobody was in a position to tell you no everybodys yessing you and everybody wants a piece of you so what do you do
4716928 and there are no residual hurt feelings i think shes an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it and to everybody else the hell with you which men could do easily she went out and got what she wanted and then he in turn did it for her and then he didnt that was him going after what he wanted with no baggage he never looked back he just kept going
4716929 it was the hardest thing to write about i was young and vulnerable and insecure there were pressures from all around and i couldnt find my place any more i didnt feel i had anybody i could turn to that makes you really fall apart and thats how i felt
4716930 only four people in new york know what that means he makes guitars
4716931 but its true so it doesnt go from page to page but the emotion that i managed to find is true
4716932 this stat is according to a recent study did by essence magazine i heard about this stat on tyra banks what do you guys think about that i guess this is why there are so many forums as it relates to ir dating here on the aa topix i really do feel it has to do with appearance skin tone and hair length and texture the whole comparance thing between black women and none black women has been taken to another level by not only society but black men as well i guess i dont know if black men wanting none black women has more to do with just their preference which i am totally o k with or as some black women have suggested it has to do with self hatred i mean come on 73 that is fairly large number
4716933 what did white men stop smashing black women and girls all of a sudden
4716934 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
4716935 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4716936 i was sick three days ago with some gastrointestinal issues so im really happy to be feeling as good as i am right now
4716937 it was bad i was vomiting and had gi issues i was supposed to fly out from our training camp on wednesday and i couldnt even get on the flight
4716938 when we were in dalian a lot of kids got sick
4716939 there were five people every day that got sick it was a nice training camp but i just dont think they could control the food i dont want to make a big deal out of this they did the best they could for her the food poisoning came at a good time because we were done training it came at a bad time because as far as recovery is concerned we just didnt have a whole lot of time
4716940 all these olympic athletes are really hard workers and sometimes they dont know how to take time to rest so i think the forced rest leading up to this was actually a good thing it got her mind off the race and onto getting healthy again she was able to get in 10 12 hours of sleep at night which by the looks of it thats what her body needed i wouldnt have changed anything good for her eating the poisonous food i guess it all works out in the end i wouldnt have changed a thing
4716941 we were very positive she was very positive in the warm up area she didnt even want to wear an ice vest it was good karma shes starting to talk like me now which is not good and she said expletive we dont need to use the ice vest we kind of hard nosed it the emotions we went through we were just going to tough this thing out and she did
4716942 there was a point in the middle of the race where i thought this could really go well or really bad
4716943 it started to hurt and i just found my happy place and thought of my favorite run at home
4716944 it was not only her best time performance race it was by far the smartest race shes ever run in her career strategically she ran it perfectly
4716945 i hate the word fluke and my medal had people using the word fluke
4716946 shalane showed the strength of us distance running is no fluke
4716947 its such a fun race i really enjoy the shorter races i feel like a really well rounded athlete doing some of the shorter races what a special occasion to perform i dont see myself passing it up i flew all the way over here and im just going to run as hard as i can and see wherever that gets me
4716948 all four swimmers have broken the australian record all are olympic medallists so hopefully we can walk away with a medal lauterstein said
4716949 were going to give the americans a good shake hopefully stop phelpsy from getting his eighth gold
4716950 it was just a great race to be a part of it was an absolute spectacle lauterstein said
4716951 i said it yesterday when you hear michael phelps do his arm slaps it gets your heart rate racing
4716952 so to handle the pressure again and come out and do another pb thats three pbs in three swims is pretty special
4716953 i had no idea i knew that i wasnt winning lauterstein said
4716954 i could see the guy next to me out ahead of me and i could feel the kenyan right next to me but apart from that i had no idea
4716955 i made michael laugh on the way out to the medal ceremony by telling him to really enjoy it mate lauterstein said
4716956 i couldnt believe i was about to cry when i heard the american national anthem

4717030 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4717031 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4717032 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4717033 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4717040 we threw around thoughts about working together on something and we werent sure if it was a book or maybe it was a film and maybe it was a show of my portraits
4717041 and here we are 21 2 years later and its all of those things its a book thats coming out next month from simon amp schuster and it is a traveling show of portraits thats in houstons museum of fine arts now going to the brooklyn museum
4717042 i dont know a single black person who likes hearing that stuff like the blacklist or black hearted
4717043 so why dont we just get together a really cool interesting group of black people and call it the black list so much about the black culture has been about reclaiming the negative anyway
4717044 thats the only way i thought i was ever going to be involved in the movies
4717045 its funny ive worked at comcast and ive done some things before but collectively this is all sort of our first experience
4717046 so everything that we said we were going to do people would say oh no that wont happen
4717047 wed say well were going to take it to sundance
4717048 you cant get into sundance you guys have never done anything
4717049 and then we got the call guess what were in sundance

4717081 finding our place in the world as culture makers requires us to pay attention to cultures many dimensions
4717082 some people choose a set of cultural ripples that was not originally their own when they do so in pursuit of economic or political opportunities weve traditionally called them immigrants when they do so in pursuit of evangelistic or religious opportunities weve called them missionaries but as wheels within wheels overlap more and more in a mobile world most of us have some choice about which cultures we will call our own we are almost all immigrants now and more of us than we may realize are missionaries too

4717095 ben haim has been with us only a few weeks but he has fitted in superbly
4717096 he has a point to prove after what must have been a very frustrating year for him at chelsea
4717097 but he has channelled all that into training and his performances so far he is very versatile and is a good tackler
4717098 i felt we needed to be a bit more vocal at the back and tal has already shown that he likes everyone around him to know what he thinks they should be doing
4717099 his international experience will be vital if we keep progressing in the uefa cup as well
4717100 martin is someone i have great respect for and he is shaping a good side there
4717101 but i know city have a good record at villa in recent years and i am keen to keep that going by getting us off to the best possible start
4717102 we are still working on systems and personnel and what will enable us to sustain a level of performance right from the start to the end of a premier league season
4717103 while we are looking to improve the squad if we can we already have good players here
4717104 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed against midtjylland but we will see an improvement at the weekend
4717105 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times
4717106 he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem
4717107 that is the kind of individual you are dealing with he has that great desire to play anywhere
4717108 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others
4717109 but chelsea are the most experienced and they might be our biggest threat
4717110 last season it took us a bit of time to get ourselves focused before we really went on a consistent run
4717111 we understand the significance and importance of representing our country
4717112 big picture for usa basketball last couple olympics that you were not a part of maybe the reputation wasnt the greatest in the world this is a different team isnt it
4717113 it is a different team i think its a different attitude i think we understand the significance and importance of representing our country i think that was something that was maybe missing on those past teams
4717114 tell the story of when you got your usa uniform
4717115 i had goosebumps and i actually just looked at it for a while i just held it there and laid it across my bed and just stared at it for a few minutes as a kid growing up this is the ultimate ultimate in basketball
4717116 where does the patriotism come from inside of you historically what is it
4717117 our country we believe is the greatest country in the world and it has given us so many great opportunities
4717118 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that you are fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
4717119 no its a cool thing for me to say i feel great about it and im not ashamed to say it this is a tremendous honor
4717120 there have been some of the most spectacular plays that ive ever seen come out of this
4717121 you know we get a kick out of that that is what gets us going when we make plays like that we acknowledge each other and our team seems to feed off of that
4717122 meeting michael phelps and dara torres the first night that we got here was fun i was planning on meeting them but also having an opportunity for me im a huge soccer fan and one of my favorite players in the world is lionel messi who plays for argentina hes just a phenom hes 21 years old and already hes one of the best players in the world moments like that are just cool theyre cool moments
4717123 i think one of my favorite moments was listening to you talking with the italian television crew we did an interview and then you go right next door and do the italian one i understand that you speak spanish as well youre like a one man un here its unbelievable
4717124 its a blast its the first time my teammates have ever really heard me speak another language theyre like damn how many languages do you speak its been fun
4717125 you know every once in a while somebody will make a comment to me about young people in this country today but these young olympians have represented our country so magnificently that i think we should all be very proud
4717126 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4717127 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont
4717128 abramovich wants chelsea to play very well and win the fans are the same its not just mr abramovich
4717129 but they need to understand that sometimes it is difficult to play beautifully and win sometimes it is impossible because the other team plays a different style
4717130 it is my style and i have been a coach now for 24 25 years i try to play very well and win but if you dont win people forget that you played very well people kill you you can play very well for one or two months then you dont win then its over
4717131 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4717132 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4717133 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4717134 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4717135 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4717136 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4717137 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4717138 keane has been training really well really hard but he will need time to get used to his team mates and torres
4717139 but i have no problems with him he can play up front with torres or in behind it will depend on the game
4717140 he has quality game intelligence and i believe i will enjoy watching him play for liverpool
4717141 let me look through my little black book and see what kind of game im in the mood to play

4717157 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4717158 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies

4717164 after the athens games i didnt think about participating in the beijing games especially during the last two years
4717165 i wasnt doing very well and i was kind of confused i didnt know what to do but then i persevered i tried very hard i did a lot of training so this gold didnt come very easy
4717166 i did a lot and paid a lot for this gold
4717167 im 33 years old and i made it to the finals in this beijing games i believe it was tenacity that got me this gold medal
4717168 since i didnt get the gold medal im still a bit upset and i just hope that tomorrow lin dan will be able to beat lee chong wei
4717169 im not thinking about london olympics now its hard to imagine if i will participate
4717170 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4717171 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4717172 warner bros decision and it was not motivated by anything twilight related
4717173 we were sixth last season and the goal is to be better this time
4717174 we were close to liverpool for a lot of time last season and now we have a stronger squad
4717175 there is no reason to believe that we cant reach the top four
4717176 it is my belief and i hope that everyone else believes it as well we have a chance to do it
4717177 this is a challenge for me and i do like a challenge there is a great environment at the club and i like the way that we all pull together
4717178 we are one unit and that is very important for me there is a great group of players here it is an ambitious young squad that can only get better and better
4717179 i am only 28 but i have been in the game a long time so i hope i can help the younger players
4717180 ukraine mulighed for at etablere et aktivt samarbejde med europ iske lande
4717181 it is a concern but i know with the type of strikers we have at the club that we will score goals
4717182 i know those players will come good and i know as long as we are creating opportunities that we will score goals
4717183 i think we dominated after the sending off and we did create chances on another day we would have won the game
4717184 they are a much improved side they are a big set and when i had a look at them they played up the middle
4717185 we are not the biggest side so we will have to be smart and keep our momentum its all about us making sure we keep improving and keep executing a lot better than we have been
4717186 it would be fantastic if we could get a home tie but we have a big hurdle this week and another massive one at york next week that game could determine where both teams finish up
4717187 last sundays win over swinton was very good for us it consolidated our position and we knew we would definitely be playing finals football
4717188 lets see where we can end up if we get a home draw great if not its an eliminator a knockout but you have got to be in it to win it
4717189 we will take a look at both guys in training but at this stage of the season we are not going to risk anybody we have fit players and well bring them in
4717190 we played really last week and well just be trying our best in each game we play
4717191 were not really looking at the table its more a case of just playing the game as well as we can
4717192 manchester leeds and newcastle for example all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex
4717193 service in manchester is warm and friendly but not very professional its as if the prices are set in london but the service is set in rochdale
4717194 if anybody has been on the london underground and seen people there with their grey scowling faces they would never want to live in the south
4717195 we live in one of the best parts of britain
4717196 what i and others have got to do is make sure there are high quality jobs for the graduates that have gone to university so they have something to come back to
4717197 with places like zen internet it shows its possible for quality jobs to be created in our town
4717198 parts of the report are actually quite insulting both to people and businesses
4717199 the north wests economy is bigger than 15 eu countries and greater manchester is responsible for approximately half of this the local economy has never been stronger even as we face uncertain times
4717200 a lot of this is down to that regeneration which the report states isnt working
4717201 i am absolutely furious this is what i have been arguing about all along
4717202 i cannot believe that any government yet alone our government would continue to encourage people to use these chemicals after discovering the dangers
4717203 i am very very angry about it and we have big plans for this information
4717204 we objected to that result because it was a 21 over per side match and the handbook clearly states that matches can only be decided on a minimum of 22 overs per team if rain affected
4717205 we were informed the umpires had told the captains before play started that it was going to be a match of 21 overs per team but the umpires got it wrong according to the rules
4717206 we have appealed but the league said they would rather hear the appeal after this weekends matches between us and heyside so as not to inflame the situation
4717207 we are still waiting for a date for the appeal hearing
4717208 we did write to the ecb and lancashire cricket board to see if they could do anything but both said it was a league matter and could only be settled by the league
4717209 we asked the ecb to look at what had happened but unfortunately they cannot do anything about the result
4717210 we do understand however that action has been taken against the umpires
4717211 wir gehen davon aus dass die verschiebung keine auswirkung auf den besucheransturm hat
4717212 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended

4717214 the west midlands also has a particularly important place in the history of the modern olympic games it was the wenlock olympian games held in much wenlock in shropshire and devised by dr william penny brookes that inspired the creation of the modern olympic movement so were delighted that the region has got behind the handover celebrations with such enthusiasm

4717218 there is an urgent need for research to identify the reasons why so many of our young people with their life opportunities ahead of them take their own lives
4717219 it is important that the reasons why this is happening are identified and understood so that society may respond appropriately
4717220 preventative responses to suicide need to be embedded into a wide range of areas of societal policy that include education criminal justice and health the detail of the programme to do this is set out in the report reach out the national strategy for action on suicide prevention 2005 2014
4717221 resources must be in place so that the recommendations in this report are introduced and in strict accordance to the time scale set out in the document
4717222 all deaths are tragic but it is a fact that more people die by suicide than on our roads
4717223 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4717224 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4717225 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4717226 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4717227 there would have been a lot more wind distributed snow it moves around i heard one guy say it was up to his neck travelling in those sorts of conditions is very difficult
4717228 in the southern alps you have got altitude and high mountains near the ocean you get a lot of serious snowfalls we get 50 metres of cumulative snowfall a year here
4717229 they dug in and they had plenty of food and supplies

4717231 no baby i mean my family has a lot of money were extremely wealthy
4717232 i dont understand but what about working at the restaurant and going to culinary school
4717233 i love cooking and i work to gain experience i certainly dont have to work
4717234 we arent the type of people who throw our wealth around we go about our business and live normal lives no limos or jets or lavish homes just good basic people who have a whole lot of money
4717235 trent im not someone who usually wears expensive jewelry so i need to know what im dealing with here is this ring terribly expensive
4717236 no no in fact at the jewelry store we debated whether you would even wear it at all the rings are fully insured but theyre platinum so im sure theyll be pretty durable like our love
4717237 but if you lose it club trent is reopening to the general public
4717238 someone is gonna get lucky tonight and that someone is me
4717239 whatever hell if you bought me a ring like that id sleep with ya too
4717240 baby will you stop worrying about the ring its just metal it can be replaced whats important is that its the ring i gave you and you choose to wear it okay
4717241 hes afraid the ring is too expensive and he might lose it
4717242 honey dont you worry about that the ring is insured well get you another one if something happens to that one just dont you worry about that
4717243 yeah but if i lose it he threatened to re open club trent
4717244 sweetie club trent was never really a hot spot anyway i dont think you have anything to worry about there
4717245 yeah good now lets see about getting you knocked up
4717246 its real this is all real we are real i love you baby
4717247 trent i want you so bad i want you to fill me with your cum breed my ass baby
4717248 trent i want your load in me so badly just fill me with your cum my ass is all yours mark your territory baby make me yours come on baby
4717249 oh yeah thats a good boy you want it dont you you want my big load
4717250 i am willing to go to the highest court in the land to protect these services
4717251 i struggle to get to the post office and i know that there are many people who are less fortunate
4717252 i think it is a shame that i have to go to these lengths to protect services that should remain open i will take them on all the way
4717253 there is a lot of anger in our community at this closure and carol is typical of the type of customer who will be adversely affected
4717254 she struggles to the post office at times and just like dozens of local residents is shell shocked at this illogical decision
4717255 i will look forward to our day in court and thank carol for being willing to lead our case
4717256 we said at the start of this campaign that we will fight tooth and nail and that is exactly what we are doing the details of the decision are vague lack accuracy and are presumptuous to say the least i am angry about this decision that will affect so many and any court in the land will see their flawed conclusions we are confident that we will win
4717257 these are difficult decisions which have not been taken lightly
4717258 we have considered very carefully all the comments during the public consultation
4717259 we wanted him to leave this program with a medal around his neck we came up a bit short
4717260 my feeling is more general disappointment over not playing a better game
4717261 i think this was a game we should have beaten the usa i feel we had more in us
4717262 it has been a wonderful nine years for me and my family and the program
4717263 there has been continual development of the team and for womens soccer in canada
4717264 before that it was just sporadic camps a couple of times a year
4717265 weve been able to have a full time job with this team hes really paved the way for the next coach coming in
4717266 its a shame to hear mens players saying that when they are no where
4717267 you wouldnt know it just seeing him but hes absolutely hilarious
4717268 i dont even know how to put into words what even has meant for this program and canadian womens soccer and to me
4717269 thats what were considering that they are staying at home more than going out right now and thats why they are using more of our products that are very simple to use
4717270 i wouldnt call it doom and gloom i just cant buy into that but it is slower its definitely slower its a challenging time 25 44 and when its really really prosperous in the economy and people are feeling prosperous then you can sell anything
4717271 well i dont know if its better than most but i definitely have a product that is a creative product so in slower times theres kind of a different market where people are looking to make a really fabulous hand made personalized gift
4717272 here on average i think it is anywhere from six to seven hundred dollars a booth so its really good compared to other shows that ive done
4717273 thats why last year we only had one booth and it was just so crowded and its hard to get the people to walk through and look at all of our products so this year we did two booths
4717274 obviously this is a time of great uncertainty within the gaming business
4717275 a lot of it is caused by uncertainty regarding gas prices and the economic slowdown
4717276 thats the flip side and that is what has happened with a lot of big vegas oriented companies they changed the business model and it turns out that business model is much more susceptible to recession
4717277 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations
4717278 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4717279 fatah has showed its readiness to join a national committee to resolve the issue of political arrests by setting up a mechanism to release the prisoners

4717285 it didnt cross my mind that people wanted to talk to me today
4717286 i think its more important to be available when something goes wrong
4717287 since the trade happened ive had a lot of pent up emotions and anxiety thats how it is when you go to a new team
4717288 you try to fit in try to impress people sometimes maybe try to do too much thats what i didnt want to happen i tried to be as calm as i could tried to control my breathing tried to remember what i was doing in cleveland and not change anything just tried to be myself
4717289 kent knows how to hit thats the highest compliment i can pay
4717290 he knows the situation and is a patient hitter hes been huge for us
4717291 now if we fall behind early you know that if you stop the other team there weve got an offense that has produced a lot of runs lately
4717292 you can give up a couple runs and it doesnt mean we wont win
4717293 the way weve been putting runs on the board the past week theres no sense of panic on the bench if we get down a couple runs
4717294 some pitchers if they dont have good stuff or location they get frustrated
4717295 its not easy to face a guy who can hit the ball out of the park like him but joe beimel was a cool customer

4717306 iran should not present on a silver platter the justifications and the pretexts for those who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
4717307 we are at the early stages of this inquiry but we believe there may have been witnesses who could assist our investigation into finding out what happened
4717308 immediately after the mens 100m butterfly we got an official written protest from serbia which was questioning the arrival of phelps as being too fast
4717309 under our rules we do listen to protests we looked at video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second after phelps one was stroking and one was gliding
4717310 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4717311 and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and this will take some doing because they are quality players who are going out

4717314 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem
4717315 that is the kind of individual you are dealing with he has that great desire to play anywhere
4717316 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others
4717317 but chelsea are the most experienced and they might be our biggest threat
4717318 i think a lot of guys would like me for a girlfriend
4717319 mom how can i help you around the house today wash the cars mow the lawn your wish is my command
4717320 we know there are people and groups in the community with great ideas for port related projects that will enhance san pedro for its residents and visitors and we want to hear them
4717321 they didnt hire me at first because i didnt have car selling experience
4717322 but one week later i went back and they hired me
4717323 i discount the price that people pay for the cars when they ask for
4717324 my concern was to be a vehicle to help the citizens of compton by personally donating financial resources to youth and poor people in the city of compton
4717325 they needed monies for an event and mr alabama gave them the monies needed
4717326 living in compton at one time we were considered the murder capital in america with all the gang violence lovett said
4717327 i would like businesses to give back to our youth
4717328 with all the major budget cuts that will be coming down to youth and social programs this is the time for citizens to focus on giving back to the community
4717329 whatever we call him for as far as youth programs we have hes there and with money
4717330 that money goes into an account for youth programs and car pros lets him do that
4717331 i thank mayor perrodin of compton and the compton city council for their support in monitoring the benefits received by the youth and the poor
4717332 what a wonderful citizen he has been especially to the youth of the city of compton
4717333 he is a really awesome sponsor he decided to be a sponsor for the school this year to help them out in the athletics department
4717334 he is sponsoring 1 200 in ads to help out with the athletic department we really appreciate him as a sponsor at carson high school
4717335 i wish more would follow the example of mr alabama we are given so much and blessed with so much and what better way than to give to the youth of the community
4717336 youre able to see your monies at work in the lives of youth mr alabama is a blessing he has encouraged me to be more involved in the youth programs
4717337 if i dont ever sell a car again its just a good feeling to know that god put me here to help people
4717338 hes given me a reason for my second chance and i dedicate all i do to my lord and savior jesus christ
4717339 i strongly encourage all individuals and business to focus their attention to helping the poor and our youth to avoid violence and community destruction
4717340 together we can make our community a better place to live
4717341 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4717342 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4717343 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4717344 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4717345 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4717346 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4717347 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4717348 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4717349 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4717350 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4717351 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4717352 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4717353 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4717354 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4717355 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4717356 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4717357 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4717358 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4717359 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4717360 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4717361 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4717362 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4717363 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4717364 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4717365 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4717366 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4717367 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4717368 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4717369 fok is een groot aanhanger van de vrijheid van meningsuiting maar in dit geval trek ik een persoonlijke grens

4717372 emotions such as anger depression and tension can accompany increases in fatigue when individuals believe their ability to achieve their goal of for example winning their race or match at the olympic games is under threat
4717373 but the competitors who view feelings of fatigue as a necessary part of achieving their goal of winning a medal or gaining a personal best are more able to repair negative emotions that can jeopardise performance at the highest level
4717374 while there we met local historian roy turner who introduced us to the fascinating and little known details of presleys early years turner opened up a world that we didnt know existed
4717375 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday
4717376 it is not possible for the united states which even failed to protect its ally georgia to attack iran the us could not even protect its own ally us clout in world politics is decreasing moreover it is in a major economic depression
4717377 we will see that the us empire will crack and eventually collapse there is nothing that the us can do against iran
4717378 a base for reaching an agreement over the iranian nuclear issue
4717379 there is no compromise that we will make their hands are empty they cant even protect georgia
4717380 the united states will soon leave the region then regional countries should fill the security vacuum there is no need for the interference of other countries
4717381 i have never said such a thing i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to leave iraq soon
4717382 it is not possible to get involved in other problems in the middle east as long as this problem is not solved one should look at where this regime is coming from we are not anti semitic or enemies of jews as a matter of fact zionists are not jews either they are irreligious and atheists
4717383 what makes the decision hard is the unknown am i going to have an injury or an illness or something that i cant forecast now
4717384 were asking patients to take much more responsibility for their overall health
4717385 it requires very little its not hard to accommodate someone and the benefits are awesome for moms and babies
4717386 for our younger moms breast feeding is going to save them some money
4717387 we want to increase the rate of breast feeding duration because there are so many health benefits for babies and mothers
4717388 weve had a good response its a work in progress
4717389 it didnt cost us a thing and it wasnt inconvenient at all
4717390 the indian troops have been hoisting indian flags on the clock tower on january 26 and august 15 unfurling green flags on the tower is our symbolic way to register our protests against illegal occupation of kashmir
4717391 were hitting a wall now and were so close to impeachment proceedings
4717392 its this commando thing of his his living here would be like a red rag to a bull he wants to be photographed playing golf and taking it easy
4717393 basically musharraf is being stubborn the two sides are playing brinkmanship
4717394 all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4717395 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out
4717396 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4717397 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4717398 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4717399 i tell them he ate breakfast at 5 oclock in the afternoon but then hed eat dinner at 1 oclock at night
4717400 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
4717401 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
4717402 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4717403 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure

4717457 c redo che dopo aver perso la change della scorsa settimana la pallacanestro torinese non vedr pi la luce inutili gli sforzi degli irriducibili tanto per citarne uno lamico gianni asti che solo lanno scorso ha tentato di unire gli sforzi di pi realt per un progetto ambizioso ma con delle umili basi ma il treno che passato pochi giorni fa che arrivava da novara e avrebbe potuto fare capolino a torino lo abbiamo perso il problema che non avevamo neanche il biglietto ma come dei mendicanti che chiedono degli spiccioli non abbiamo raggiunto la cifra pazienza non sar mica la fine del mondo se torino non ha una serie a di basket d altronde lo disse anche valentino castellani quando ricopriva la carica di sindaco qualche legislatura fa ma non mi sembra che il sindaco chiamparino e soprattutto lassessore allo sport montabone abbiano commentato allo stesso modo la retrocessione del torino calcio forse perch i tifosi della pallacanestro non si incazzano come quelli del calcio o forse perch i voti dei cestisti sono meno pesanti di quelli dei calciatori ma non preoccupatevi le strutture importanti lassessore montabone non le abbandona il palazetto dello sport di torino andava recuperato perch ci sono grandi progetti bene adesso tutto pronto assessore possiamo partire mancano solo 400mila euro perch i restanti 800mila li abbiamo trovati ma niente da fare i soldi non ci sono un piccolo articolo sulla stampa che non lo trovi neanche se sei uno speleologo e abbiamo risolto il problema in modo silenzioso come sempre accade con la pallacanestro ma vi ricordo che lex filadelfia ci rinfresca la memoria quasi tutte le settimane con la sua love story detto cio potrebbe sembrare che la mia polemica sia diretta anche al mondo del calcio invece non cosi se chi ama uno sport qualunque esso sia deve essere pronto a scendere in piazza e gridare che anche il suo piccolo giardino ha bisogno di attenzioni e di sostegno infatti grazie al sogno granata il cuore del torino continua a battere e sperare non sono ne un politico ne tantomeno un imprenditore ma orgoglioso di essere solo uno sportivo quindi faccio appello alla classe politica torinese e chiedo a nome di tutti un appuntamento con chi vuole a prendersi a cuore la nostra causa anche se fosse lassessorato alle politiche sociali visto che ora mai divenuto un problema sociale

4717495 maddux is a great competitor and i enjoyed watching him pitch tonight
4717496 i felt like i had command of pretty much everything tonight i kept my pitch count down and we made some nice defensive plays its fun to be a part of its nice to come out on top of a game like that
4717497 burrell got me i threw the pitch where i wanted to but obviously i should have throw it somewhere else but he got me
4717498 the thing about maddux is that he throws a lot of fastballs and obviously they have a lot of movement
4717499 fortunately for us i got one i could handle and hit it over the fence it was pretty fun tonight to watch that pitching matchup
4717500 it just goes to show you that if you know what youre doing you can keep the runners down
4717501 you dont have to throw 95 that was good pitching both of them put the ball where they wanted to

4717506 i will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and will give your descendants all these lands and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed 5 because abraham obeyed me and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
4717507 the men of the place might kill me on account of rebekah for she is beautiful
4717508 behold certainly she is your wife how then did you say she is my sister

4717520 i am still in the iraq mode mentally and no matter what i try to do or think about i can not seem to get the iraq mode out of my system
4717521 its time to stop operating in the old time mode when trying to build transit centered areas
4717522 we kind of envision this strongly encouraging a lifestyle change
4717523 i have been actively participating and championing the people of this district for 21 2 years

4717531 i dont know if frank chopp is targeting me but hes keeping me busy
4717532 i always run the race hard im committed to my job as a state representative so im here campaigning to keep it
4717533 my negatives in polling data are only 7 percent so obviously im not disliked
4717534 and all my signs are on private property not public right of way those are all people that i know and ive met and ive talked to and they agree with me
4717535 first time we were down this path we felt like that was an objective of ours to have 50 to 80 hours of gameplay
4717536 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4717537 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

4717546 new book out and making the move to open access
4717547 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4717548 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4717549 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4717550 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4717551 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4717552 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4717553 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4717554 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4717555 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4717556 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4717557 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4717558 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4717559 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4717560 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4717561 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4717562 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4717563 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4717564 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4717565 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4717566 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4717567 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4717568 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4717569 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4717570 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4717571 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4717572 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4717573 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4717574 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4717575 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4717576 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4717577 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4717578 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4717579 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4717580 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4717581 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4717582 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4717583 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4717584 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4717585 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4717586 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4717587 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4717588 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4717589 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4717590 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4717591 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4717592 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4717593 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4717594 entra y toma todo lo que desees pero no te olvides de lo principal pero recuerda algo despu s que salgas la puerta se cerrar para siempre por lo tanto aprovecha la oportunidad pero no te olvides de lo principal

4717611 its not that bad now that ive had a closer look at it
4717612 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4717613 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4717614 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4717615 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4717616 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4717617 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4717618 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4717619 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4717620 we think every bit of weight we can put behind our case for sovereignty is important
4717621 adding history to that equation can only enhance that case
4717622 we certainly think by establishing a long standing presence in the arctic that can enhance issues of sovereignty look at the strait the northwest passage not far from where this ship is
4717623 its certainly part of what we call canada others dont necessarily recognize that claim so were committed to doing everything we can to have a presence in the north environmentally whether its establishing a long standing presence and history whether its resource based whether its militarily
4717624 but we have a decent chance thats all i can say one thing i will promise you when we are finished the work there we should cover between 400 and 800 square kilometres during these weeks
4717625 to win it as part of a team is a totally different feeling than when you do it individually
4717626 we thought we were up against it in this event and its not the one we were fancied in
4717627 the french thumped us in the world championships but to turn that around at the olympics is the stuff of dreams
4717628 i was struggling a bit at the back and thought i was going to fall off the pace but that keeps it interesting you dont want a boring race do you
4717629 i did the best three laps of my life and to do it against the french was great because they are pretty much invincible
4717630 i thought it was the olympics and i thought everyone would up their game to be honest
4717631 i worked hard for this and i thought people would have a bit more than that
4717632 i was really pleased for steven burke i knew he could do a 4 22 minutes but he didnt know he could do it in qualifying
4717633 i am not surprised about our success here everyone was giving it large after the world championships asking how are you going to do that again this is what the whole four years has been about it is great

4717636 i am hoping to come back here on sunday and give it everything i have got i will swim like it is the last race of my life
4717637 we were all really pleased with that i think we all enjoyed it
4717638 i felt really relaxed as soon as i got in the pool
4717639 we came third to the americans and australians in the world championships but in these competitions you never know anyone in the finals can beat anyone on their day
4717640 this does make up for the disappointment of not qualifying for the 200m freestyle i think it made us more determined to show what we were about
4717641 i think we have got a good chance of a medal we will never give in and you never know what is going to happen on the day
4717642 we are quite a new team to this and to break the british record is really pleasing i think we have all got a little bit more to give in the final on sunday
4717643 i think having the extra day off will really benefit us
4717644 you can read too much into these things and the players are obsessed with these numbers
4717645 we dont think stokes is a no 9 you can look at it like that apparently he used to be 44 at arsenal allegedly but i cant understand why these players are obsessed by numbers and some are
4717646 we had a clean slate with all the players and we just gave them the numbers we felt were right i dont think weve got a no 3 i dont think theres a no 5 or a no 9 people can read into that all they want
4717647 some players have certain favourites but we changed the numbers believe it or not just to upset certain people all ive heard during pre season is whats my number whats my number well for all your bitching were going to give you a different number so thats why i like to rattle a few cages every now and again
4717648 sometimes theres too much made of characters listen theyre good players ive played with some tough characters and some tough players people you wouldnt mess with
4717649 but the bottom line is when youre in a game situation or when youre looking around your dressing room like we will be against liverpool you want to be thinking im glad hes next to me
4717650 im in much better shape than that and its just not up to par with what i know i can do
4717651 im disappointed with the whole day maybe its because its my first heptathlon of the year but im not as competitive as i know i should be
4717652 its a solid day and only my shot was really poor but overall it was just average
4717653 i wanted to win that 200m and run under 23 seconds because thats what ive been doing in training but it wasnt there
4717654 ive another three events and ill try to do something but who knows what is possible im just really really upset
4717655 to come to the olympic games and make the semi final is fantastic i can only hope that i surprise a few more people yet
4717656 everyone doubted me and ive had injuries but ive proved people wrong when people doubt me and put pressure on me thats when im at my best
4717657 i belong in the final and im very confident of making it
4717658 i have asked for an investigation one that is transparent and impartial
4717659 this is long haul work but i am committing myself and my team to do whatever we can to improve the quality of life of young people of montreal north
4717660 you could draw a horizontal line from houston to jacksonville and from dallas to atlanta in between i 20 and i 10 and there would be as many football players in that area than any other area in the country
4717661 in most of the rest of the world college football is a game and they love it in the south its not a game its a way of life
4717662 its built into the dna like no other place in the world
4717663 theres always going to be nay sayers people that are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
4717664 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats gonna mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships
4717665 thats kind of why i do the things preaching in prisons doing those different things trying to take advantage of that platform that god has blessed me with
4717666 the things he does he would be doing them even if he wasnt a heisman winner
4717667 a lot of schools i dont know how many have done the same thing since we did
4717668 i have great respect for other ways of doing things and people understand we do certain things our way
4717669 but every situation is different you try to make sure you have all the facts and make sure you made the best decision you possibly can
4717670 im inclined to think it might have been more foreign investors who are selling canada completely as opposed to canadian investors who are getting out of commodities and getting into financials
4717671 confiscated the road sign along highway one and they confiscated the sign so many times that the county just gave up trying to give bolinas a sign
4717672 there was no fight i was a little bit subdued and thats not how i shoot
4717673 i shoot with passion and aggression and here i was too relaxed i didnt feel as determined as i did against marco and if im relaxed my personality is squashed down im the sort of person who needs to compete aggressively
4717674 past experiences have taught me how to prepare myself but sometimes you need some outside help and a bit of a kick up the backside
4717675 after the first two rounds here i felt deep down i could go all the way and win it and that nothing could stop me it was just me that i had to get past
4717676 the thought of winning a medal here is something thats always in your mind
4717677 id done everything right in preparing technically and physically but mentally maybe not
4717678 next year its the world games which i was second in last time but ive got a big decision to make about 2012
4717679 i want to do it but it depends on everything else in my life
4717680 ill go back to work for a few months then review things
4717681 its been such a long drawn out period waiting for this and then its all over in about ten minutes

4717693 before the snows start falling in afghanistan by the middle of october at the latest
4717694 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
4717695 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
4717696 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
4717697 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
4717698 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
4717699 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
4717700 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
4717701 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
4717702 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4717703 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
4717704 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4717705 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
4717706 a cautionary tale about rushing to judgement in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act
4717707 please contact me upon your return to the states so we can continue this dialogue
4717708 received all of the department of defense documents on able danger and had found no mention of atta
4717709 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization
4717710 one of the most important pieces of evidence the fbi would ever discover allowing investigators to map the links of the al qaeda network all across the globe
4717711 keen to reveal the ambiguous role of the cia and to restrain washington from extending the war to iraq and elsewhere
4717712 what went wrong the c i a and the failure of american intelligence new yorker october 1 2001
4717713 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
4717714 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom
4717715 al qaeda leaders say nuclear power stations were original targets
4717716 israeli intelligence bin laden is dead heir has been chosen
4717717 second officer says 9 11 leader was named before attacks

4717728 cuando empec en esto cobraba unos 60 euros por un completo ahora cobro entre 30 y 40
4717729 llevo nueve meses intentando trabajar en esto aunque ahora la cosa est muy dif cil a ver si mejora en septiembre
4717730 ltimamente todas las chicas se quejan del descenso de clientes especialmente desde la huelga de camioneros de junio
4717731 adem s si puede se queda con mis clientes porque est claro que la gente de fuera nos quita el trabajo a las espa olas
4717732 es natural cuando hay menos dinero para gastar se gasta menos
4717733 la crisis empez a notarse pr cticamente despu s de las elecciones hay muchos menos clientes y sin embargo m s se oritas que piden plaza en nuestros hoteles
4717734 el verano lo trastoca todo la gente pasa las vacaciones en la playa y muchas veces las se oritas se desplazan tambi n desde el interior de espa a
4717735 precisa cort s sin embargo el negocio podr a verse afectado a medio plazo debido al par n de las productoras de material audiovisual de este tipo
4717736 i hope obama wins that would make me happy but i still wont be happy about the state of american politics
4717737 religion should be an outlawed topic when between employee and guest
4717738 turn your tv on theres a movie coming on that youve got to see
4717739 yes love just like a big girl good job sweetie alright
4717740 yes rachel just like a big girl watch for cars be careful
4717741 thank you for telling me rachel that was very mature decision
4717742 look mom look at all these friends i finally have
4717743 look mom look what i want to make of myself
4717744 shes done a lot already in the past few days i thought it would be nice to let her sleep in for a change
4717745 im almost ashamed to admit it but i didnt believe you at first
4717746 if if it was anything at all like what you said you experienced then i can understand why you are so shaken up about it you must have gotten the worst of it i was almost too scared to move
4717747 there really isnt a whole lot that we can do right now we can only wait and try to get ourselves out of this mess until he it or whatever decides to tell us what he wants
4717748 i thought all hope was lost when we didnt have any bait for the hook and line
4717749 its about what happened on the ship they warned me about involving anyone else and i thought that i was keeping you well enough out of the middle of it until last night i felt somewhat in the night that disturbed me no end i knew it would happen eventually but i had hoped that you two would not be drawn into it its gone too far now you have to know
4717750 if you knew it would happen then why didnt you say something
4717751 i didnt know it would happen so soon i thought that surely we would have made it to shaldun and handed the artifact over to the cenoc then it would have been out of even my hands
4717752 how how did you know it was going to happen in the first place
4717753 who this has something to do with what ever is inside that box you carry doesnt it
4717754 you might say that it has everything to do with it it has everything to do with well everything
4717755 im afraid i dont know much more than mikel im assuming theres more to it
4717756 the cenoc know as much as any humans are able but my knowledge of it is not far behind their own the written records are extremely complicated and more often than not so vague that they might as well be of no use to anyone
4717757 you mean to tell us that there are actual written records of the creation
4717758 amongst the oldest of tales is one that speaks of a fallen angel that was stripped of his powers and made to walk the world for all eternity
4717759 anubis rallied many angels with false words and bloated promises and a great battle was waged in heaven that lasted for hundreds of years
4717760 geabrilanelle the greatest of the angels eventually dealt anubis a nearly fatal blow
4717761 he was not stripped of the entirety of his powers for they are the substance of an angels being it is all but impossible to completely destroy an angel for as long as there is even the smallest bit of his power left he cannot be killed by any save true god himself there has always been much speculation and argument about why true god did not destroy anubis but that is something that we mortals were not meant to know our limited minds could not possibly encompass the enormity of such a thing
4717762 what does all this have to do with what happened to the ship
4717763 i mean if you are saying what i think you are saying then this anubis has been following us he must want something
4717764 the stone in which anubis sealed his powers was cast from heaven by his followers with the intent that he would recover it
4717765 from time to time the anubis stone was found and then lost again
4717766 anubis has been involved in events on many of these occasions and has come very close to getting his hands on the stone behind the old tales behind the keeping of the word of true god behind the rock hard veneer that is the cenoc there lies a greater purpose that purpose is to protect the world from the terrors of the anubis stone and to protect the anubis stone from anubis himself
4717767 mikel mikel in true gods name i wasnt sure you would make it
4717768 you had us worried mikel i daresay nehtalia never slept this whole time and myself just barely
4717769 dain nehtalia what are we doing out here on this this
4717770 at least i think it was a man i know he didnt belong on the ship
4717771 he was something else all the crew was already dead i thought i was going insane and then
4717772 you can tell us about it later when you remember more right now you need to rest truly we all do
4717773 shes right mikel you were near death when we found you floating in the wreckage and hauled you out youre lucky to even be alive if it werent for our luck in finding enough pieces of the ship large enough to lash together and some mooring to tie harrier to none of us would be here now
4717774 theres no point in trying to move on right now were all exhausted
4717775 i wonder where we are we could be just about anywhere in shaldun
4717776 i imagine we are somewhere along the far northern shore that storm might have blown us as much as twenty leagues off course after all we didnt even make it around the east horn but i wouldnt go as far as to say it couldnt be more by my guess we are near the dead wood its an ancient forest that turned to stone long before people settled here in shaldun we couldnt possibly be too far east of its western border but it will be rough going until we get through it
4717777 well have to see if we can make something to catch some fish in the morning this place is a death trap if we dont find some way to get food i dont suppose you were able to salvage anything from the ship before it sank were you
4717778 im sorry mikel it was all i could do to get the things that i did dain was still too weak to carry much not to mention we had yourself and a frightened horse on top all the rest
4717779 im just glad that were all still alive and relatively unharmed
4717780 you asked dain and me for protection on your journey and already youve done more to keep us well than i ever thought we would have to do for you
4717781 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
4717782 the angle styles match was fine until the overwrought overbooked finish
4717783 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
4717784 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
4717785 besides striker who was money again my ecw hat goes off to mark henry again this week
4717786 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4717787 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4717788 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4717789 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4717790 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4717791 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4717792 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4717793 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4717794 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4717795 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4717796 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4717797 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4717798 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4717799 non venite perch non vi vogliamo il capo della lega nord ha per liquidato le accuse di
4717800 de la econom a del ladrillo a la econom a del conocimiento
4717801 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4717802 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4717803 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
4717804 poti is not operating at all technically it is ok to start but the stevedores dont feel safe enough
4717805 i i went into the captains quarters to fetch something for him the i heard the thunder then i came out and they were all gone
4717806 in all my years of sailing i have never seen its like
4717807 you must want something else you would not be here
4717808 the man was a milk sop just a pawn in a much grander scheme
4717809 believe me the possibility has not eluded me but i have looked at this from points of view that you could never imagine there is not a doubt in my mind that lukas maerlon is to blame
4717810 you concern yourself with seeing new lands thats your reason for coming on this trip dont let my affairs interfere
4717811 that was a very interesting story you told earlier master dageron
4717812 unless your eyes lie you carry a secret as well what is it that pulls you to shaldun
4717813 i might ask the same of you but then i already know
4717814 no i can not say what brings me it is a secret
4717815 what i mean is i want to travel with you i must meet with the head of the cenoc in shaldun concerning a matter of grave importance i want you and the other one to accompany me i have seen the way you carry that blade master dageron and i would have you at my side for protection
4717816 theres just something about her that doesnt sit well with me
4717817 i cant shake this feeling that shes hiding something and the way she watches us its unnerving to say the least
4717818 she was only trying to see what we were like before asking us to accompany her to shaldun yes she may have secrets but i have secrets as do you everyone has secrets if she doesnt wish to confide in us well that is her own prerogative
4717819 im just saying that we hardly know her what if she is more than she seems to be what if shes connected to house maerlon in some way what would you do then
4717820 theres really no way i could know that dain not unless she told us and pardon me for being the pessimist i dont think that she would tell us even if she was either way it wouldnt mean that she was involved in my wifes death theres just no way to know for sure we can but trust her until she proves herself untrustworthy
4717821 there is a woman out there who is traveling alone in a hostile land she has asked us for protection and i am honor bound to comply ive failed to protect someone before as you well know i can not i will not let that happen again im not asking you to trust her just to give it a chance if in the event that such a thing should occur she proves you right then she is on her own but for now she has asked for our help and that is exactly what she is going to get
4717822 maybe youre right im telling you though theres just something i dont know off about her maybe its just that im nervous this is my first time to shaldun after all maybe its just that
4717823 i felt much the same way when i first left darias it will pass in time that is not to say that being weary of people until you know them is not a good trait to have but sometimes you just have to trust people whether you want to or not you cant go around not trusting anyone
4717824 i know its not dain but you have to start somewhere
4717825 yes i guess i could try to get to know her a little better before we get there that is if she will talk to me instead of just watching
4717826 you can but try just give it a chance that is all i ask now lets get some sleep
4717827 one of my men tells me that he is home
4717828 remember harnan if anyone comes just whistle ill leave the door cracked so that i can hear
4717829 tell me you sack of shit or so help me i will skin you alive
4717830 i i dont know his name he spoke with a strange accent
4717831 i think so its been a long time since ive been there
4717832 he said he didnt remember who hired him but i dont think that he even ever knew he also said the guy sounded foreign
4717833 given the circumstances i dont find it very plausible that she would have been privy to his current affairs she was just an ordinary whore who happened to accept and offer from the wrong person doubtless she will have nightmares for a long time after she sees his corpse
4717834 she fainted too quickly to get a good look at me and besides i had my hood up when i entered the room
4717835 porter dain just call me dain though thats what everyone calls me
4717836 you may call me mikel using my full name seems just a bit stuffy and formal to me i trust your uncle explained my situation
4717837 uncle harnan did indeed tell me why you are here i extend my deepest sincerity and regret for your loss uncle harnan has told me many things about you and aineen
4717838 so what sort of things has your uncle told you about me nothing bad i hope
4717839 mostly he tells me stories about your experiences in battle is it true that you used to be a captain in the imperial guard
4717840 i have already spoken with captain lushen quintas of the
4717841 but word in some of the more respectable taverns is that hes one of the best captains to be found his prices are quite reasonable as well he trades quite often between darias and shaldun so he knows the way quite well
4717842 ill have to speak to him myself but if i judge him to be a trustworthy man then it would save me the time of finding someone else to carry us to shaldun
4717843 i want every last bit of this bloody mess cleaned up
4717844 if i find so much as one grain of rice on this dock its coming out of everyones wages am i understood
4717845 and this is the dageron fellow i presume dain here told me a little about why you are here im willing to take you to shaldun but once you are there you are on your own i dont suppose i need to tell you that its dangerous for darians there right now unless of course you are a trader
4717846 im familiar with shaldun it may seem fool hardy but i must find the man responsible for my wifes death
4717847 sometimes you just have to do what needs to be done no matter the consequences
4717848 i may only be there to experience new places but at least mikel will not be in a strange land alone
4717849 if you will we can discuss the details in my private quarters
4717850 this is quite good captain is it belgaeran per chance
4717851 i see youve a taste for fine brandy would you care for another glass
4717852 as you know i have need to travel to shaldun
4717853 i am willing to negotiate the price whatever it is i am good for it i will pay you half when we depart from luskan and the other half when we leave shaldun as well as any incidental necessities on the way
4717854 i can take you as far as r th mishak
4717855 it is the closest port to shaldun and it just so happens that i possess a warrant for safe harbor in their port like you said i will not become entangled in matters that do not concern me but there is good money to be made in r th mishak besides it is the least i can do for a fellow countryman especially one who fought in the war
4717856 i have done business with dains uncle before and he is an honest enough fellow what do you say to two hundred crowns and no incidentals half here and half when we leave r th mishak
4717857 one hundred seventy and incidentals thats as low as i can go i do have a crew to pay
4717858 one of my men tells me that he is home
4717859 remember harnan if anyone comes just whistle ill leave the door cracked so that i can hear
4717860 i thought you might come here before you left im glad you did
4717861 it sounds rather like you forgot to eat this morning my friend elise get some food for mikel here
4717862 there is something i wanted to speak with you about
4717863 it seems like all you can think about is disposing of this lukas maerlon and i havent seen you even so much as smirk with any amount of feeling since well since aineen was killed it is not healthy to let your hatred consume you you know as well as i do that it will destroy you if you let it
4717864 but im not going to rest until lukas maerlon is dead i cant when he killed aineen he killed my happiness i have to avenge her death harnan otherwise i will always carry the guilt of not being there for her in here
4717865 at least this way i will be able to put some of that guilt to rest
4717866 i let that bastard escape if i had killed him there in shaldun then my wife would still be alive and i would still have purpose in my life aside from retribution
4717867 i apologize harnan i dont know what came over me
4717868 just think about what ive said alright listen i have a nephew in luskan who is interested in traveling he would like to accompany you to shaldun just wait before you refuse
4717869 dain is a good man and he is my nephew he can hold his own and he knows how to talk to people he might come in useful in shaldun all im asking is that you consider it
4717870 im telling you now though if he gets in the way or cant keep up i will have to leave him to find his own way back
4717871 mikel my friend it is good to see you yes
4717872 we need to speak in private harnan its its about aineen i dont know who else i can trust
4717873 i have an idea of who might have done it but im not sure i made more than a few enemies in shaldun
4717874 i saw her not seven days ago said she had received word that the army was returning home what how why mikel why
4717875 and you think this young maerlon is here in darias
4717876 he probably hired someone to do it for him odds are he is still in shaldun and his hireling is somewhere here waiting for an opportunity to kill me as well
4717877 and i doubt that you would be here now if you had any idea of who the killer is
4717878 i need for you to see if you can find out anything about this man
4717879 i will take care of everything every man that i know i can trust will be keeping a sharp eye and an open ear if i learn of anything you will know it within the hour
4717880 just make sure that they are careful if this man hears that he is being sought out then others might be in danger we have to assume that he is very dangerous aineen was not one to be easily overcome
4717881 stole everything but the bastards smallclothes or right near enough course hes allus been on that side of the law if you unnerstand me didnt seeim for a good bit i guess i figgered he got imself caught or killed then nary two weeks ago he comes around an hes got himself all this money course i ask im if hes been stealin agin an he just smiles kind of wicked like and orders some beer he tells me this story bout how someone paid him to off his wife some fella what lives a few miles out of the city
4717882 name of erold lives above the weaver on faeris street in the second district i aint sayin aught else
4717883 i was wondering if you had seen the man who lives upstairs today i have some news for him from his brother in carlon
4717884 i dont hold much truck with that no good lout havent seen him today but he usually comes in after dark hes always making a ruckus when hes there and his residence stinks some days its bad enough to keep away good paying customers trade hasnt been the same since he moved in
4717885 theres a stair around the side just leave a note for him there im sure he will get it now if you dont have anything else to waste my time with i have work to do
4717886 besides fifteen years as high striker should account for something i can hold my own
4717887 and something like that can make a man irrational just listen to yourself you are so consumed with your revenge that you cant even accept help when it bites you in the ass im going whether you like it or not
4717888 if i cannot persuade you to stay here then at least promise me that you will not get in my way or erolds for that matter
4717889 i thank you it was my mother who taught me to cook and her mother before me
4717890 well its nothing more than i would offer any well paying guest i wish you both the best of luck in your travels
4717891 you seemed to be rather taken with the serving girl back there
4717892 take it from someone who knows love real love comes about only so often in this life you cant be afraid of it you have to cherish it make the most of it while you can sooner or later it is going to leave be it death disenchantment or any number of things it will eventually leave you
4717893 i was not there for her in her time of need and for that i can not forgive myself when you find you love dain hold on to it never let it go it is the greatest thing in life for without love love of life love of your fellow man love of any sort we are nothing but animals with conscious thought we cease to be human without love
4717894 it wont be easy at first just remember being afraid of love is senseless and only makes you miserable in the long run i had it and i let it go i let it be stolen and now i am lost without it
4717895 love can be the source of the worst pain you will ever feel but it can also be the source of the greatest happiness in the world once it is lost it is almost impossible to find again it is worth the pain though the happiness i only hope you dont let it pass you by
4717896 sounds like the captain is in a good mood this morning
4717897 no need to look so worried what happened the other day was but a freak accident
4717898 if you will follow me gentlemen i will show you to your bunk
4717899 i thought we were supposed to have separate bunks not that i mind sharing of course but well
4717900 well you see i had another request for passage to shaldun a woman and i thought it best that she should have a bunk of her own it wouldnt seem right to make her share with one of you now would it
4717901 it could always blow over or we could pass it by before it gets nasty but in the event that we are caught in this storm i cant have anyone not of my crew running around above deck
4717902 i understand captain ill make sure that dain and i stay below if things start getting precarious ill pass word along to nehtalia as well
4717903 speaking of nehtalia if you dont mind me asking do you know anything about her suppose maybe why she would be going to shaldun
4717904 the lady has requisitioned dain and myself to accompany her to shaldun for protection i would just like to know who i am traveling with before the time comes
4717905 i cant say as i know much more than you do she seems to be rather taciturn if you ask me she has a strange little box she keeps with her heavy as sin that but she refused to let any of my men touch the thing
4717906 that is something you will have to ask her yourself if you really want to know
4717907 you might say that if she came from there she has come a long way indeed
4717908 well i dont know what her business is nor do i care so long as she pays
4717909 would you care for a glass of brandy before you go
4717910 ill let them know about the storm captain thank you for the warning
4717911 ive been trying to get to know her but she will hardly speak to me its frustrating all she does is smile to herself and talk about the weather or the water or the ship
4717912 just keep trying dain surely she will open up eventually she will have to if she is going to come with us
4717913 the captain wanted me to make sure that you and nehtalia stay below decks if we get caught in the storm above is not a place for the inexperienced the crew will have its hands full just keeping the ship afloat
4717914 do you know where i can find nehtalia the quintas asked me to relay the same message to her as well
4717915 i suppose shes up top somewhere id try the crows nest if i were you
4717916 but for all i know she could be actually sitting atop the main mast itself i wouldnt put it past her at this point
4717917 the captain asked me to warn you that in the event that the storm does overcome us he would like you dain and me to stay below decks
4717918 if you like you can stay with dain and me
4717919 we could talk of things ive had many questions arise since meeting you
4717920 i think that would be quite acceptable master dageron should the storm overcome us i would be most obliged to sit it out with master dain and you
4717921 i appreciate that you would join us i believe it best that we get to know one another better if we are to be traveling together
4717922 just get below deck and make sure that nothing heavy can fall on you
4717923 im going to be sick again if this gets too much worse
4717924 i have some herbs that might help with your stomach
4717925 nehtalia the captain tells me that you come from celladorn i took you for just another darian woman but it seems that i have been wrong about a number of things concerning you
4717926 celladorn is a country far to the north of darias nearly a thousand leagues north to be somewhat precise
4717927 though of what importance it could possibly bear is beyond me
4717928 i am sorry master dageron but i did not know that this was to be an interrogation
4717929 i just want some answers i think it only fair that we know what we might be risking our lives for it must be terribly important for you to have come so far
4717930 what i carry is for none save the cenoc i can only tell you that it is a most ancient artifact that belongs in the safe keeping of the church
4717931 valuable is not the word i would use priceless perhaps irreplaceable maybe dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands
4717932 i would ask you not to mock me master dageron
4717933 you broach a very serious and delicate subject if the cenoc wishes you to know what it is then they alone can tell you it is not my place
4717934 i have my own ends to see to in shaldun and i need to know if this business with the cenoc is going to interfere i cant let that happen
4717935 i have to make maerlon pay for what he did to me
4717936 if i could tell you then i would but as i have said it is not my place
4717937 ill go get those herbs perhaps you should lie down dain
4717938 it might not taste very good but it will help with your stomach chew it until it is good and moist then hold it between cheek and gums master dageron would you be so kind as to fetch a cup of water
4717939 it is just a bit of wind and rain nothing to be scared of
4717940 you really should relax boy o captain quintas can get us out of this no worries no worries
4717941 thats it boy o easy now i have to go dain is sick and needs some help i have to bring some water to nehtalia for his medicine ill come back and see you when its all over
4717942 no thank you master dageron dain has the beginnings of scorbutus has he been eating alright
4717943 i dont know i dont watch him eat all the time come to think of it though he has seemed a bit gaunt in the face lately
4717944 sea sickness can be a very serious matter master dageron we are lucky that we caught this now before it became more serious
4717945 its an herbal infusion that has all the vital elements that dains body is missing it helps make up for the lack of nutrients and give his body a sort of head start i also put something in there for his nausea and fever
4717946 i should have paid more attention to him its his first time at sea after all i should have been more considerate
4717947 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
4717948 i actually thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4717949 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i let my roar out
4717950 i really dont know what to say i guess ive had the perfect situations all week
4717951 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4717952 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4717953 i just have one race left the relay and then its done
4717954 tying spitzs record is pretty cool its great to be a part of all of this
4717955 not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4717956 under our rules we do listen to protests we looked at video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second after phelps one was stroking and one was gliding
4717957 two independent timing systems showed exactly the same on the time phelps was 50 58 cavic was 50 59
4717958 the automatic timing systems are in perfect order and there are no doubts
4717959 although the rules dont allow for team leaders to watch the video footage i had a meeting with the serbia team leaders to afford them the opportunity to see the video themselves because we dont want them to go away feeling something is lost
4717960 the serbian team were very satisfied and agreed with the comments of the referee
4717961 michael phelps is the greatest ever and he would have been first in this race any how the question was whether to share the gold medal or not to share
4717962 but what the referee saw was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever the first arrival was michael phelps
4717963 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4717964 i am not angry i knew it would be a fast race and i knew michael would be fast
4717965 i knew he would be coming at me there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles
4717966 tidak perlu memilih jalani saja keduanya bagi saya no problem
4717967 walaupun kunjungan dinas ibu erni selesai malam hari tetap saja pulang ke rumahnya di bogor dan besoknya pagi pagi sudah kelihatan lagi di kantor kalau seharian sibuk di kantor biasanya bekerja over time hingga magrib bahkan kadang pasang target waktu sampai pukul 12 malam untuk rapat dengan staf menyelesaikan makalah atau teks pidato buat acara besok paginya
4717968 ooo kebetulan ada event acara puncak pekan penghijauan nasional di kabupaten solok tahun 1982 sekalian saja selesai acara saya jadi mampir ke pariaman
4717969 ada juga orang yang mencoletehi saya waktu saya menjadi pejabat di pusat jadilah saya angkatan udara terbang terbang melulu ke berbagai wilayah nusantara mengurusi kelembagaan pengelolaan das tetapi sekarang saya dibilang jadi angkatan darat ha ha ha karena perjalanan dinas saya hanya dijangkau dengan perjalanan darat di tiga provinsi jawa barat dki jakarta dan banten
4717970 suaranya makin renyah seraya mengatakan gantinya fitness adalah rajin menelan multi vitamin dan merenggangkan otot saat bangun tidur
4717971 bayangkan luas wilayah das yang menjadi tanggungjawab saya mencakup tiga provinsi wilayahnya sensitif dengan berbagai permasalahan jawa barat dan banten sebagai kawasan vital yang ber akses langsung ke ibukota negara musim kemarau panjang di jakarta selalu kekurangan air tanah dan nanti kalau volume hujan berlebihan jakarta banjir lagi jadi kantor kami di musim kemarau kena sorotan musim hujan apalagi
4717972 prinsipnya hujan turun harus sebanyak mungkin menyerap ke dalam tanah tidak hanyut begitu saja ke hilir di depok dan jakarta dan ini harus dengan pekerjaan yang berdampak strategis
4717973 pengelolaan das terpadu jangan ditunda lagi penerapannya supaya tata ruang di kawasan wisata puncak kan sebagai daerah tangkapan air kembali dilindungi
4717974 bahwa tata ruang itu ada perencanaan pelaksanaan dan pengendalian tiga tiganya harus dijalankan sebagai penerapan pengelolaan das terpadu pada sungai sungai yang hilirnya mengalir ke jakarta yaitu ciliwung dan cisadane
4717975 saya ditantang oleh kepala dinas kehutanan provinsi jawa barat supaya berkoordinasi dengan beberapa kepala dinas kabupaten bogor untuk memecahkan problema itu kalau berhasil katanya hebat saya cuma ha ha ha dulu lah
4717976 i would say ive got some new strengths on the interior line
4717977 it could have been kind of predictable last year but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
4717978 ive been working on a couple of different things and trying out some things some of it ill keep some of it ill probably throw away hopefully once we get into a game and i use them well see how it works
4717979 you do definitely need counters to moves that would be considered your key move
4717980 im so happy we had a great year in the online gaming for the greater society sector
4717981 so i think its a good idea to give back to the employees with raises and a party
4717982 we recognize that as leaders in the community its important to give to those who are less fortunate even though the money we earn in the online gaming for the greater society industry is well deserved we think that helping others out is an important value to instill in our work force so that the world around us improves as wee do
4717983 were going to have a good time with friends co workers and family at our holiday festivities this event culminates our year of hard work and efforts and gives everyone a chance to relax and enjoy a festive atmosphere a number of surprises are planned so be sure to save this date on your calendars
4717984 its my hope to get people out of their cubicles and into the hall for some fun laughter and cocktails
4717985 because we hard very hard at being leaders in the online gaming for the greater society industry and we deserve a chance to let it all hang out
4717986 were so happy to be fortunate enough to hold this event every year it really motivates our employees and staff and helps us focus on our company community at large
4717987 we want all of you to come back to schaller schwantes inc and celebrate during the holiday season when we give thanks for family friends and the good fortune we enjoy
4717988 this event which celebrates our success in the online gaming for the greater society field also serves as a good break for our hard working staff
4717989 and we find that employee morale is greatly improved after a celebratory occasion and bonuses are handed out
4717990 we want to give back to our employees and the community
4717991 and after the party next month all employees will receive a cost of living plus merit bonus on top of their current salaries
4717992 so i think its a good idea to give back to the employees with raises and a party
4717993 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the
4717994 i think the potential for success marketing gaming club casino in most all countries so why not casino games

4718012 r formes structurelles men es depuis cinq ou six ans
4718013 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding las vegas nevada politics i look to the studies and conclusions of chantell grenko who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
4718014 the knock gave me a lot of confidence i had prepared well before coming here and hope to maintain my form my intention was to spend time in the middle because i havent played for a while then i played my strokes
4718015 the conditions will be different in dambulla so we tried to have partnerships to make a good total its important we play according to the conditions and thats what we will try there
4718016 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really sort of lost for words
4718017 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4718018 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4718019 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000km a year
4718020 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4718021 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4718022 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer

4718026 con unas rampas de acceso muy estrictas para dicho tipo de tr fico que podr an crear incluso situaciones de peligrosidad vial
4718027 pese a los reiterados intentos del ayuntamiento de alcasser y de la generalitat por darle una soluci n m s acorde a los accesos a tres municipios con una poblaci n conjunta de m s de 30 000 habitantes adif ha rechazado cualquier alternativa
4718028 but thats what it was you cant argue with that you just have to get better
4718029 when you talk about a number like that its not good
4718030 its a high number the goal is not to give up any one or two might happen you might be able to live with that
4718031 but to give up the number we did in some of the games last year thats pretty tough to win a ballgame like that
4718032 some were around eight seconds but if thats how long the play is we just have to block a lot longer
4718033 i asked the guys how many we had and everyone in the room knew
4718034 they have great pride and they dont feel too good about that they want to do something about it
4718035 weve got some depth and weve got some guys with experience
4718036 the competition is going to be very strong no one has anything locked in including our seniors wed be disappointed if certain guys werent playing but the best five are going to play
4718037 and believe me they take great pride in their performance and i think well see a much more cohesive you know better executing group up there thats just common sense
4718038 were not there yet we certainly didnt see it out there the last spring scrimmage think of a couple plays there that were kind of ugly by the end of camp i think well be ready to go
4718039 there is nothing astronomical you have to do to fix it
4718040 its just little small things you learn from day one it comes down to finishing plays too
4718041 ive had cancer for a long time and ive had people i know riding
4718042 everyone would ask if they could list me as someone they were riding for so when i finished my chemo in 2004 i told my husband i was going to do it for myself
4718043 all the other years she has been my pace car i have the tendency to go out too quickly but we didnt do that i think we were all in tun making sure went out at a good pace we had her in our thoughts the whole way
4718044 as my doctor says its not weeks away but its not generations away either
4718045 but ive got next year to look forward to its a good goal for me

4718048 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude
4718049 yo sab a que no estaba tan detr s de cavic como en la eliminatoria cuando cort la ltima brazada pens que me costar a la carrera pero fue justamente lo contrario si yo me hubiera deslizado no habr a ido tan lejos hice dos r pidas brazadas cortas para intentar llegar y tocar el muro al final tome la decisi n correcta
4718050 vi la carrera despu s en la pantalla gigante y la vi a c mara lenta imagen a imagen en la c mara de masaje en el ordenador

4718054 fue lo mismo que en el relevo 400 libre uno de los nadadores franceses dijo algo que nos movi usamos cosas como estas y comentarios como este para motivarnos para excitarnos incluso m s pienso que los nadadores americanos aprovechamos esto bob me dijo algo de esto esta ma ana y pens dejemos a la nataci n hablar es lo que siempre hemos hecho siempre doy por bienvenidos los comentarios as que si alguien quiere decir algo me gusta me motiva para hacer m s

4718062 nu doen we eigenlijk alleen maar plaats delict dat zijn alleen maar hele heftige moordzaken
4718063 ik was eigenlijk behoorlijk sceptisch en dat ben ik nog steeds er zijn altijd wel bepaalde types bij van ik voel me zo en ik heb zon pijn in mijn buik maar er gebeuren toch dingen waar ik niet omheen kan
4718064 ik wil de zwemsport veranderen ik weet zeker dat ik de komende vier jaar nog nieuwe doelen kan stellen
4718065 toen ik mijn laatste slag had gedaan dacht ik dat ik had verloren maar het was precies andersom als ik was uitgedreven had het me te veel tijd gekost daarom maakte ik kortere snellere slagen om mijn hand op de muur te krijgen dat was achteraf de juiste beslissing
4718066 ik heb het frame voor frame bekeken het is bijna niet te zien zo dicht zaten we bij elkaar
4718067 laat ik beginnen te zeggen dat ik helemaal niets met madonna heb ik vind haar verschrikkelijk ze kan niet zingen ze komt heel onsympathiek over

4718075 when you talk about a number like that its not good
4718076 its a high number the goal is not to give up any one or two might happen you might be able to live with that
4718077 but to give up the number we did in some of the games last year thats pretty tough to win a ballgame like that
4718078 some were around eight seconds but if thats how long the play is we just have to block a lot longer
4718079 i asked the guys how many we had and everyone in the room knew
4718080 they have great pride and they dont feel too good about that they want to do something about it
4718081 weve got some depth and weve got some guys with experience
4718082 the competition is going to be very strong no one has anything locked in including our seniors wed be disappointed if certain guys werent playing but the best five are going to play
4718083 and believe me they take great pride in their performance and i think well see a much more cohesive you know better executing group up there thats just common sense
4718084 were not there yet we certainly didnt see it out there the last spring scrimmage think of a couple plays there that were kind of ugly by the end of camp i think well be ready to go
4718085 there is nothing astronomical you have to do to fix it
4718086 its just little small things you learn from day one it comes down to finishing plays too

4718090 mi girano le scatole anche se un quinto posto a nove secondi dalla zona medaglie un buon risultato forse se laustraliano e il cinese fossero stati fermati
4718091 come resistenza avrei potuto tranquillamente percorrere altri due giri di questo circuito dove anche per ragioni di sicurezza si gareggiato davanti a pochi intimi n d r spiega lazzurro per mi mancato il cambio di passo anzi non mi proprio riuscito dentro di me non ne avevo pi in gara ho speso ogni energia ma non sono andato male infatti ho chiuso a dieci secondi dal mio record personale non so come sia riuscito il russo a fare quegli strappi se ho qualche sospetto altri marciatori russi sono stati sospesi per doping n d r non sta a me dirlo io so solo che ho fatto il mio

4718095 for coaches like them to talk about it like that is a disgrace to them as people
4718096 our club has never been a willing participant in anything like that
4718097 it was well below what we expect even for a side as young as that it wasnt acceptable
4718098 it was important for our members and supporters who have been coming here week after week in what has been a tough season we are able to repay them today to some degree
4718099 the opposition cant give you the impetus to play well the next week

4718103 the islamists of algeria are highly educated people and as such do not seem to have much in common with the al qaeda guys
4718104 western governments must recognize that the tiny proportion of the population that ends up in terrorist cells cannot exist without the availability of broader sources of active or passive sympathy resources and support
4718105 we are in a battle and more than half of this battle is taking place in the battlefield of the media we are in a media battle for the hearts and minds of our umma
4718106 it is anxious to seek retribution for the blood of the martyrs the grief of the mothers the deprivation of the orphans the suffering of the detainees and the sores of the tortured people throughout the land of islam
4718107 the heart wounding images of american soldiers humiliating torturing and killing iraqi prisoners

4718110 one idea is to get a new prepaid sim card and sms this person if you can get someone elses nic to obtain the connection that would be a bonus considering everyones drivers and the drivers servant has a brokerage account at the kse a sim card should be a relatively straightforward process

4718116 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4718117 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4718118 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4718119 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4718120 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really sort of lost for words
4718121 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4718122 all of these islands offer pristine beaches and their own unique features
4718123 our travellers have identified the hot islands in the med this summer especially if you want sun sea and dancing all night
4718124 we would have to say the troodos mountains were our highlight you will know what we mean if you take the journey breathtaking
4718125 apart from the beaches mykonos is a place to dance all night long
4718126 if you are in sicily go on the sunset tour of mount etna you can see the steaming ground and smell the sulphur
4718127 visit the abaco bar its hidden behind giant wooden church like doors but inside its a theatrical experience not to be missed
4718128 the calm sea makes it easy to get into the grotto through the cliff wall and the sun shining gives the water the most beautiful blue colour
4718129 el d a a d a en estas ciudades es de 600 000 personas que van de una ciudad a otra las cuales se complementan culturalmente
4718130 lo que podemos ofrecer como un solo n cleo es lo mismo que podr a ofrecer madrid que adem s de ser una ciudad es un conjunto de n cleos urbanos que tienen sus propios ayuntamientos
4718131 en esta poca las redes sociales son la forma de llegar a todos
4718132 es una ciudad reconocida internacionalmente por los sanfermines y porque es pionera en cuestiones de investigaci n e innovaci n en el sector farmacol gico tecnol gico y en las energ as renovables pero queremos que se nos conozca tambi n por la cultura

4718134 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans he said
4718135 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4718136 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation he said
4718137 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
4718138 because weve noted a huge demand for online gaming transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for online gaming companies and many others
4718139 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
4718140 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a online gaming product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
4718141 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
4718142 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy online gaming stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
4718143 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the online gaming industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
4718144 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase online gaming items but choose to do offline
4718145 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
4718146 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
4718147 most operators like patlan sharrett and sons corp prefer credit cards and online transactions when it comes to selling their various online gaming products
4718148 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
4718149 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
4718150 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
4718151 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
4718152 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
4718153 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4718154 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4718155 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4718156 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4718157 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4718158 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major middle eastern gaming policy biographical novel release
4718159 and we expect to sell out very fast kecia siskas middle eastern gaming policy book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
4718160 im happy we were able to release my middle eastern gaming policy book on time
4718161 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
4718162 this book speaks volumes about the impact of middle eastern gaming policy in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
4718163 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author myles madruga who has pledged support for this system
4718164 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the middle eastern gaming policy industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
4718165 because the work that has been done in the middle eastern gaming policy literary area has been huge
4718166 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my middle eastern gaming policy students irregardless of what critics believe
4718167 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
4718168 pre sale polls show this new middle eastern gaming policy book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
4718169 and i believe radics mcsparins book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
4718170 i think bavaro kunzelmans new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
4718171 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things

4718176 doncaster have done fantastic to win promotion and saturdays game will be their first home game in this higher division
4718177 so we expect a big passionate home crowd but were more than capable of dealing with that
4718178 last year saw the tragic death of our trainee fieldmaster and her family have since raised money for the air ambulance and we wanted to do our bit
4718179 and although jo anne is no longer with us her family is fully supporting the event
4718180 the event is sponsored by many local companies and there will be a choice of distances to cover from four to fifteen miles
4718181 there will also be a prize for the most sponsorship money raised

4718463 as i noted last week yes the problem occurs on a new windows user account on several different windows computers running xp vista 32 and vista 64 i havent tried it on my mac because i dont run entourage but i need it to sync properly with outlook i should note itunes direct sync with outlook works just fine i can sync calendars and contacts with no issues direct to itunes and my iphone it is only mobilme that has the problem ive gone as far as setting up a test box with a brand new clean install of windows then installing outlook and itunes fresh and importing my contacts and calendar into a clean pst file then ill do a reset sync and then a normal sync just to make sure the sync always appears successful on the computer side but may or may not populate the calendar or contacts on mobileme sometimes the data populates sometimes it doesnt if it does populate the calendar and contacts within an hour or so for no apparent reason and without syncing again the calendar and contacts will erase themselves off of mobilme if i have syncing enabled they will also erase themselves off my iphone and even out of outlook after that first sync no later sync will populate changes and doing a sync reset will have no effect recently the contacts stopped erasing themselves though the calendar still does still neither will sync any changes after that first sync just in the last few days a new symptom has arisen where suddenly for no apparent reason i now have 10 calendars in mobileme all titled either home or work all blank and i cannot delete them or adjust any of their properties after the first sync working and subsequent failing i have tried uninstalling all apple software going as far as going into the registry manually to pull it out rebooting uninstalling outlook rebooting then reinstalling everything cleanly on a different user account and trying to sync and again nothing then i ry a reset sync and a regular sync and again nothing at this point my calendar and contacts database entries in my mobilme account appear to be in an inconsistent state and i believe they need to be cleared out from the server side as i can no longer add or delete contacts or calendar entries even manually

4718484 he was lost i was constantly worried about him i didnt know where he was at what he was gonna do if he was gonna be dead or alive he was putting people out he just was a lost soul

4718580 where parents have any modicum of control they have to exercise it
4718581 it has to be a constant barrage of different ways of penetrating the psyche
4718582 theyll confuse a teen who behaves responsibly otherwise with a good driver but many good teens die in car crashes
4718583 but what they dont have is experience teens think they can handle more situations than they can they even convince themselves
4718584 its on the basis of experience that the brain rewires itself for adulthood
4718585 not because we have better teens its because we have better restrictions

4718593 we are interested in the american boy and we are trying to get him but that depends on a work permit so it will be a few days before we know about that
4718594 we had asked maurice if he thought there were any players in the american league whom he thought would do well and he recommended two or three players
4718595 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go we are in the final stages of tying everything up but we still have to apply for the work permit
4718596 he is only 22 and has played the last number of internationals so id hope we will get him all right and hes played in the olympics
4718597 they are on tour in germany but weve had problems getting in touch with them we made a bid but weve still not heard back from them weve had a problem communicating with them
4718598 he needs regular football hes been out for two years now and there is no guarantee of a position here and that wont do him any good so we will let him go out until january to see if he can get himself regular games i feel we need to do that
4718599 so if there are clubs interested they just need to get in touch with us
4718600 i absolutely cant believe that has happened i knew when i touched i had won and that was a great thing because i was just going for gold
4718601 i didnt expect that record at all it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time
4718602 to do it now and to do that time it hasnt sunk in yet
4718603 um would you prefer to do it now or later
4718604 yes thats certainly appropriate and what a nice bag to put it in

4718618 a scrap of humanity washed up on the soil of the nicu
4718619 we wanted everyone to know he is here as part of a family he has been noticed
4718620 i felt instinctively that i must make a connection to wherever his soul is the image in my mind was that he was somewhere out there real scared and really lost and even if he died that night i needed him to have been touched and named
4718621 jacob had expected warmth succour sweet milk instead there was this frail shell smelling of antiseptic with formula running down a nasogastric tube and needles stuck in tender places
4718622 we have to re educate ourselves as to how not to be passive and helpless in the medical environment how do you reclaim the human dimension in the scientific and medical world science has gone beyond our moral understanding of it
4718623 at the very least every nicu should give parents nursery rhymes to read to their kids
4718624 could not one doctor have come in and said you guys should talk
4718625 he couldnt do it and i couldnt ask for it nor could i give it back to him
4718626 my mothers a holocaust survivor and no one would discuss what happened
4718627 they were a wild bunch but they quieted right down for campfire stories i was so moved by that we werent talking the iliad it was axe murderers in the forest but its the same thing
4718628 the nurses decided that these babies werent dying for medical reasons they were dying of loneliness the nurses started holding them and they started surviving
4718629 i need hope even if there is none i need to hope
4718630 we need you to help us participate in the healing of our babies even if they are not going to make it

4718632 als ich in tiflis in den innenhof zu meiner wohnung biege
4718633 die letzten f nf tage haben die gesten und den tonfall ver ndert
4718634 wir haben sogar fremdsprachen gelernt als wir den austritt aus der zerfallenden sowjetunion verlangten wir erinnern uns wir erinnern uns wir erinnern uns
4718635 manche sprechen von russischen panzern vor tiflis manche sagen es sei unsere armee die uns sch tze manche sprechen davon dass der internationale flughafen bombardiert werden soll manche sprechen von einer blockade und manche f rchten sich davor dass es in den l den bald kein essen mehr zu kaufen gibt manche schweigen einfach nur und leben von stunde zu stunde von einer nachrichtensendung bis zur n chsten
4718636 es erscheint mir unfassbar das all das hier wirklich geschieht in georgien in einem land in dem gastfreundschaft heilig ist in dem man mit wein und gesang alle konflikte ausr umen kann
4718637 georgien ist m de georgien will einfach nur seinen frieden
4718638 wir m ssen fehler machen d rfen und aus unseren fehlern lernen k nnen ohne angst zu haben dass man uns gleich okkupiert
4718639 bei einer okkupation oder besatzung besetzung wird in einem bev lkerten gebiet die vorhandene staatsmacht durch einen externen machthaber auf dessen initiative durch die seinige ersetzt
4718640 berall russische panzer am russischen milit r zerbrochen die russischen panzer in georgien die russischen panzer von russischen panzern dass russland wieder zu seinem einstigen imperialismus zur ckkehren will von den russen kontrolliert ohne russische panzer
4718641 alle versuchten ihr leben zu meistern was auch ohne russische panzer nicht einfach ist nach 70 jahren kommunismus und 15 jahren chaos
4718642 wir erinnern uns an die rosenrevolution und die ganzen umw lzungen die darauf folgten sie waren nicht ohne fehler und immer noch fern von europ ischer demokratie aber es waren unsere umw lzungen ohne nachhilfe von russischen panzern
4718643 die revolutionen in der ukraine und in georgien nachkl nge des revolution ren herbstes 1989 fanden mit g tiger hilfe und nachhilfe amerikanischer stiftungen und think tanks statt
4718644 with all the sheep and people back in the market its brought things back to life here
4718645 the bluetongue protection zone has not impacted on us some people thought it would affect people bringing sheep here
4718646 there are vaccinated sheep here today from devon and cornwall
4718647 were very lucky that cumbria was not brought into the zone so we can come to sales over the border
4718648 anyone can come and buy here which could be good for cumbria
4718649 it has been obvious for months ever since scotland announced its decision to impose a compulsory vaccination programme later this year that we would have a period of time where cross border trade would be severely compromised
4718650 with a couple of weeks to go until vaccine is likely to be available for northumberland and cumbria i would urge the two governments to work together to try to resolve this situation before our struggling livestock industry is hit with another financial hammer blow
4718651 i came in today to buy an envelope and say bye the post office in town oxford street has queues about three miles long i think i will go to moorclose instead
4718652 we have got lots of cards and chocolates and bottles of wine from customers there has been a post office here for a very long time
4718653 most of the customers are going to oxford street with protest
4718654 i feel terrible that the post office is closing i always hoped they would change their minds but they havent the nearest post office is only on oxford street but for the elderly people who cannot get about as well then it becomes an issue for them
4718655 we are always made to feel welcome in the vulcans lane office and i will be sad to see the doors closed
4718656 the man had taken ill at the beginning of the week and died the following day he had been complaining of flu like symptoms
4718657 there were rumours going round that he had died of weils disease there were reports that other workers were complaining of the same symptoms
4718658 but the post mortem results showed that mr owen had not died of weils
4718659 our thoughts go out to the family it is extremely sad that this has happened it is dreadful
4718660 he knows he will get a hard time in prison because of what he has been convicted of
4718661 he will find the sentence very difficult to deal with
4718662 this was persistent abuse of a vulnerable girl you groomed her and on occasions were violent towards her just to gratify your sexual urges

4718669 im satisfied that in all probability he came into contact with asbestos during his working life
4718670 while it would not be appropriate for us to comment on any specific circumstances it is the case that for many years asbestos was a commonly used material at sellafield as it was in many other industries
4718671 your record has not been perfect but you have made progress and i dont want to do anything that jeopardises that
4718672 this has really shaken me up i feel someone has violated my home
4718673 we were asleep in bed when all this was going on

4718724 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4718725 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4718726 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4718727 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4718728 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4718729 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4718730 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation

4718743 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go we are in the final stages of tying everything up but we still have to apply for the work permit

4718818 about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my post office box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it
4718819 the five dollar bills just kept coming in and i just kept sorting them and stashing them in the closet i barely had time for my homework
4718820 i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the bills and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs

4718838 there was quite a bit of violence at the pool on the arab residents part and we had to figure out what to do
4718839 its a city pool and we want people to come here with their children have a good time and enjoy some peace and quiet it got to the point where violence was the order of the day and police presence at the pool was a common sight
4718840 several of the residents decided to come together and carry out a symbolic gesture so that the jewish families could enjoy themselves in a relaxed atmosphere
4718841 i hate to say this i wish the arab residents could join us and enjoy the pool with us while keeping the peace but thats just not happening theyre looking to cause trouble and thats a shame
4718842 none whatsoever they have the rest of the week for themselves to use the pool they show up whenever they want we are the ones who dont show up because of the violence
4718843 the problem of violence can be solved by instating a general overreach program not by implementing a limited one
4718844 leaving is not an option last year i asked internal security minister avi dichter to include jaffa in the city without violence project and he said that tel aviv jaffa does not meet the programs criteria
4718845 i am shocked and appalled this is outright racism to decide to deny arabs entry because theyre bad we cant accept people thinking that any official involved in making this decision should resign
4718846 the police should look into those matters and set things right but it cant affect the pool
4718847 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time gaming website design shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
4718848 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future
4718849 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
4718850 weve been working on this gaming website design project for 8 months now
4718851 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
4718852 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important gaming website design human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
4718853 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
4718854 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
4718855 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4718856 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4718857 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4718858 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4718859 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4718860 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4718861 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4718862 wait we have the truth dont believe those other fakes

4718874 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4718875 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4718876 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4718877 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4718878 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4718879 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4718880 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4718881 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4718882 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue

4718891 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4718892 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4718893 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4718894 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4718895 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4718896 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4718897 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4718898 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4718899 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4718900 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4718901 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4718902 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4718903 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4718904 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4718905 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels

4718919 one card doesnt fit all and its a matter of finding which card fits your lifestyle and your budget
4718920 its basically up to the merchant to properly code the transaction so it fits into the reward programs list of qualified stores
4718921 you shouldnt go into cash back cards expecting to get it on every purchase
4718922 studies have shown that consumers spend more on reward cards than plain jane credit cards and moreover consumers spend more on credit cards than on debit cards

4718929 i worked a lot of extra shifts and saved money in order to be able to pay for the honeymoon we knew we wanted to experience
4718930 we told everyone we were on our honeymoon and wound up receiving free meals desserts drinks gifts and even an upgrade on our rental car
4718931 the first step when planning a honeymoon is to figure out what you as a couple like and dislike
4718932 are you looking to relax on a beach experience nature or do you prefer to be more active
4718933 the key is in confiding in someone you can trust
4718934 someone who can help you with flex time and a diversion of tasks for a short period of time if needed someone who can buy you some wiggle room
4718935 always too soon voices of support for those who have lost both parents
4718936 use work and the focus it takes as an appropriate diversion to get you over a hurdle
4718937 at work youre very distracted and you should be thats not the time or place to process through a full cycle of emotions you need to carve out that time at home use the freedom at home to better evaluate where you are emotionally and to make a concrete plan to get back on track
4718938 the great thing about a service such as eap is that its designed to provide immediate advice and guidance when its truly needed
4718939 feeling out of control emotionally is not the same as being out of control it makes perfect sense to feel out of control when experiencing out of the ordinary problems
4718940 i worked so much that i didnt have anywhere to spend the money
4718941 whether youre 18 or 80 and have 5 or 500 to spend target is the place you go

4718952 but its a concern for me as leader of a das office we are human and sometimes were going to make mistakes

4718958 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4718959 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4718960 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4718961 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4718962 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4718963 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races
4718964 we can make more money on mobile than we do on the desktop eventually
4718965 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there

4718971 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4718972 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
4718973 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius
4718974 its funky its deep its very emotional but its clean
4718975 how could he understand what was inside of black people like that

4718989 the unique thing about this cast is that it has dermal ridges and the flow and texture matches the ridge flow texture of one from california
4718990 the ridges are about twice as thick as in a human being
4718991 thats what makes it unique the only other animal ive seen this in is a howler monkey in costa rica
4718992 not the missing link its not an extra terrestrial its just an animal a flesh and blood primate that has learned to be elusive around man and avoids man where possible

4718995 california is a great example of a process that led to the establishment of charitable assets that are now being used productively to provide health care
4718996 the emphasis will go from patients and employers right to the shareholders

4719008 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

4719066 salut jai la malheureuse impression quon nous amuse avec toutes ces merv
4719067 i may be a little dorky but im not officious im not an ass kisser im not hierarchical and im not as socially autistic as dwight
4719068 people come up to me and say i know a dwight really do you you know somebody with a bad haircut and a polyester suit fresh off the beet farm i dont think you do exactly but the character is so specific they say i know a dwight when they really dont
4719069 my parents thought rain was a bit too hippie ish like naming their son moonbeam so they added an extra n
4719070 when i graduated my teacher told me you know rainn this is how its going to work for you youre going to play a lot of supporting comic roles and thats how youre going to be known
4719071 its been a long long road toward that i started acting in 1990 so its been 18 years now hopefully in the future there will be opportunities to show another side of me as an actor than being an annoying creepy nerd
4719072 you can fake the guitar but you cant fake drums they set up a drumming coach for me and i spent a couple of weeks in my garage practising during the filming when i had some time away from shooting id be playing the drums we worked on the songs all through the movie
4719073 one thing that the bah faith gives you is a sense of higher purpose
4719074 with the release of each new album she begins with a controversial act like a prayer s religious exploitation the sex book bush bashing with american life then she debuts an entirely new look with expensive videos and exclusive magazine covers
4719075 by the time shes done her tour she goes into hiding at the gym for two years its this high level of strategic pr planning creating a new reinvented madge followed by a two year media blackout that has sustained her career
4719076 theres nothing wrong with being a musician at 50 but youve got to act 50 madonnas plastic surgery and working with the youngsters of the moment is just creepy and not so successful age gracefully
4719077 i dont know whats about to come and smack me in the face
4719078 i cant live my life to please other people just because a camera is constantly going to be on me
4719079 obviously i think the best way to deal with it is to just be you and take it for what it is
4719080 its kind of funny the whole idea to me is really hilarious because in canada we see it all so objectively you know what i mean we see it all for the stupid s that it really can be sometimes
4719081 so it really doesnt matter it all seems like a crazy silly little world to me all i know is that i am me and this is all ive got and if you dont like it you dont like it and if you do you do and thats it
4719082 its comforting to have some canadian company you just feel immediately bonded knowing that you are coming from the same place ketchup and chips and all baby
4719083 i want to grow and learn and be challenged in whatever i am doing
4719084 so i took a break from acting to do the internship and i was growing and learning there instead
4719085 but then this came up and it was like uh wow
4719086 shes the good kansas girl thrown into this world that she doesnt want to be a part of the nice girl coming to l a with a lot better values than most of the kids there because of the way theyve been raised and the mentality there in beverly hills
4719087 she wants to fit in but shes still got a strong head she knows this is who i am and i dont care who you are i am not going to let you walk right over me ive got to stand up for myself and teach you a lesson in a calm and you know very centred fashion
4719088 i was literally raised on it in reruns of course its bizarre because im most familiar with the first few seasons more than anything else which is hilarious since i was 4 at the time
4719089 its a crazy experience being thrown into the middle of all this i dont even know what to do its wild meeting nat joey tata and seeing jenny garth who along with a guesting doherty reprises her original role in the remake

4719162 the biggest thing is that i no longer need to have a day job to fund my writing im incredibly thankful to be in this position from that respect
4719163 i do a bit of writing that leads me to discover something about my character in the course of doing the research i come upon some interesting facts that are introduced into the story which takes it somewhere else
4719164 what ive really noticed and not just from people in the publishing industry or the media is that there is very strong reaction to the book
4719165 it provokes emotion and debate i hope it means ive written an interesting book
4719166 its not going to be a continuation of the story
4719167 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4719168 yo creo que hasta ahora ha habido esfuerzos magros esfuerzos que han sido aislados y donde ha faltado no obstante alg n nivel de coordinaci n que la ha habido debo decirlo no suficiente
4719169 la demanda del estado de m xico sobre este tema muy particular es que se tenga el dise o de una estrategia compartida donde claramente se defina la participaci n que cada nivel de gobierno habr de tener para alcanzar una condici n de mejor seguridad y donde al final de cuentas nos pongamos de acuerdo
4719170 there will be though somewhat of an homage to the original show
4719171 its about a family moving from kansas back to beverly hills
4719172 rob estes character actually grew up in beverly hills he was the next door neighbour to one of our previous characters theyve moved back now and its about how they handle this new world
4719173 well be using people from the previous show in the new one and they will organically work with our characters
4719174 but its been an easier transition than what i thought it would be the characters of dixon in
4719175 its similar to the extent that you know they both had to teach themselves how to grow how to live by themselves so its been a transition but its been quite easy
4719176 one of the differences from the original show is really having a strong adult storyline
4719177 gabe and i share a strong point of view on parenting were both fathers weve seen this generation of baby boom parents who just think theyre parenting by giving their kids money and excess and clothing and no rules
4719178 we have a strong point of view that kids need boundaries and rules and thats one of the things thats going to influence the show
4719179 the members of the wedding party made merry all night

4719507 we developed projects for water education health and humanitarian aid
4719508 that included repairing air conditioning for medical facilities constructing and equipping classrooms providing office furniture and distribution of humanitarian assistance packets such as food childrens clothing and school supplies
4719509 the plan is for us to buy the supplies now and the 11th rotation will distribute them
4719510 we will also be turning over several projects including a playground being developed at al thobad and projects to bring equipment to hospitals and medical facilities around the area
4719511 theyve told me they believe the battalion is important delivering humanitarian assistance and developing projects that have a positive impact on the people

4719518 he is very mission minded and focused he does what he is told to do and does it with competence
4719519 hes definitely one of the best gunners in the company if not the entire battalion
4719520 before i got married i only had to worry about what was good for me but now i am thinking from a different perspective

4719572 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4719573 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4719574 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4719575 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4719576 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4719577 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4719578 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4719579 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4719580 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4719581 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4719582 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4719583 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4719584 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4719585 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4719586 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4719587 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4719588 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4719589 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4719590 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4719591 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4719592 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4719593 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4719594 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4719595 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4719596 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4719597 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4719598 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4719599 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4719600 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4719601 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4719602 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4719603 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4719604 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4719605 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4719606 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4719607 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4719608 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4719609 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4719610 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4719611 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4719612 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4719613 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4719614 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4719615 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4719616 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4719617 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4719618 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4719619 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4719620 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4719621 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4719622 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4719623 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4719624 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4719625 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4719626 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4719627 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4719628 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4719629 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4719630 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4719631 what do you want your look to say to people
4719632 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4719633 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4719634 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4719635 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4719636 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4719637 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4719638 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4719639 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4719640 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4719641 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4719642 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4719643 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4719644 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4719645 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4719646 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4719647 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4719648 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4719649 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4719650 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4719651 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4719652 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4719653 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4719654 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4719655 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4719656 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4719657 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4719658 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4719659 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4719660 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4719661 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4719662 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4719663 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4719664 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4719665 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4719666 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4719667 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4719668 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4719669 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4719670 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4719671 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4719672 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4719673 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4719674 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4719675 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4719676 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4719677 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4719678 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4719679 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4719680 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4719681 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4719682 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4719683 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4719684 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4719685 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4719686 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4719687 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4719688 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4719689 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4719690 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4719691 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4719692 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4719693 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4719694 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4719695 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4719696 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4719697 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4719698 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4719699 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4719700 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4719701 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4719702 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4719703 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4719704 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4719705 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4719706 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4719707 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4719708 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4719709 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4719710 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4719711 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4719712 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4719713 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4719714 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4719715 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4719716 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4719717 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4719718 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4719719 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4719720 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4719721 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4719722 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4719723 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4719724 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4719725 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4719726 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4719727 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4719728 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4719729 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4719730 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4719731 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4719732 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4719733 i was working long hours in an enclosed environment buying flats of flowers that had already been sprayed there was moisture humidity mould stress was high and my eating habits were bad i was eating packaged food in the end i was dragged right out
4719734 i was in pain all the time and then my equilibrium went
4719735 i dont want anyone to go through what i did not knowing what was wrong with me what saved me was that i ended up with an extensive education about whats in food
4719736 food thats sold needs to have the producers name on it
4719737 il nous a dit que le r dacteur en chef johan hufnagel ne serait pas licenci pour faute grave quil serait pay pendant le temps o il sera encore salari et quune n gociation serait entam e en vue dun accord financier
4719738 il a ajout que cet pisode nallait pas atteindre professionnellement la r putation et lhonneur de m hufnagel
4719739 mis pied pour une raison que la direction a refus de communiquer aux salari s
4719740 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4719741 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4719742 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4719743 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4719744 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
4719745 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4719746 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4719747 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4719748 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4719749 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4719750 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4719751 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4719752 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4719753 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4719754 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4719755 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4719756 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4719757 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4719758 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4719759 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4719760 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4719761 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4719762 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4719763 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4719764 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4719765 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4719766 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4719767 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4719768 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4719769 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4719770 its a very clear choice and whether it be on iran or whether it be on iraq or whether it be on other national security issues sen obama does not have the experience and the knowledge and clearly the judgment

4719777 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4719778 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4719779 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4719780 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4719781 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

4719788 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4719789 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4719790 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4719791 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4719792 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4719793 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4719794 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4719795 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4719802 uno de los peores textos que he tenido la posibilidad de leer en este espacio
4719803 well i couldnt let this article pass without an opposing view having been in the industry for 20 plus years i have seen a lot of innovations come and go but nothing has the ability to more fundamentally transform corporations communication infrastructure than unified communications now the end user states a common misconception about unified communications and more specifically presence it is an often misstated issue that unified communications allows people to track your every move and locate you anywhere to the extent that your private and personal life are completely intertwined no vendor worth considering has built such a system that is currently shipping what unified communications and presence offer is the ability to be contacted by those who you wish to reach you at the time you wish to be reached and on the preferred device you want to be reached on read the latest whitepaper determining the cause of poor application performance any credible vendor in this space is having to talk in more depth and in more detail than ever before why because unified communications requires an intricate understanding not only into the corporate workflow but also corporate culture ultimately companies need to work smarter collaborate more globally and be more productive with less this requires removing the impact of human latency wherever possible it is also where one of the key challenges of unified communications lies because changing culture and habits is a tough task
4719804 i am so pleased that i could be part of the liverpool unites concert and it is something else for liverpool to be proud of
4719805 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4719806 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4719807 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4719808 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4719809 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4719810 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4719811 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4719812 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4719813 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4719814 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4719815 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4719816 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4719817 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4719818 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4719819 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4719820 asking questions of presidents has always been a huge responsibility
4719821 she feels that if she doesnt ask the question it wont get asked
4719822 her parents couldnt read or write and here is this woman who moved to washington where she didnt know anybody and made a life for herself
4719823 if you cannot read all your books fondle them peer into them let them fall open where they will read from the first sentence that arrests the eye set them back on the shelves with your own hands arrange them on your own plan so that you at least know where they are let them be your friends let them at any rate be your acquaintances
4719824 books you know charles are like lobster shells we surround ourselves with em and then we grow out of em and leave em behind as evidences of our earlier stages of development
4719825 web video is becoming ubiquitous and leaving far too many of us out
4719826 if you cannot read all your books fondle them peer into them let them fall open where they will read from the first sentence that arrests the eye set them back on the shelves with your own hands arrange them on your own plan so that you at least know where they are let them be your friends let them at any rate be your acquaintances
4719827 books you know charles are like lobster shells we surround ourselves with em and then we grow out of em and leave em behind as evidences of our earlier stages of development
4719828 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4719829 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4719830 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4719831 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4719832 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4719833 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4719834 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4719835 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4719836 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4719837 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4719838 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4719839 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4719840 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4719841 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4719842 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4719843 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4719844 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4719845 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4719846 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4719847 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4719848 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4719849 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4719850 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4719851 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4719852 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4719853 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4719854 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4719855 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4719856 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4719857 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4719858 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4719859 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4719860 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4719861 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4719862 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4719863 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4719864 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4719867 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4719868 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4719869 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4719870 i could find it for less but id rather support this local business i trust the owner and hes treated me well over the years
4719871 various types of games for the nintendo systems are represented in the top 10 demonstrating how we continue to break down the barriers between veteran and new player
4719872 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4719873 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life

4719889 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4719890 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4719891 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4719892 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4719893 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4719894 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4719895 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4719896 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4719897 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4719898 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4719899 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4719900 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4719901 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4719902 some of them are wearing a bit too little maybe but i can accept it
4719903 if you cannot read all your books fondle them peer into them let them fall open where they will read from the first sentence that arrests the eye set them back on the shelves with your own hands arrange them on your own plan so that you at least know where they are let them be your friends let them at any rate be your acquaintances
4719904 books you know charles are like lobster shells we surround ourselves with em and then we grow out of em and leave em behind as evidences of our earlier stages of development
4719905 we took a very business like approach to the race
4719906 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1 000 metres we owned it
4719907 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4719908 in my family at home we watch the olympics all the time and sure we want the canadians to do well
4719909 you order a pizza while youre watching the olympics and you pay 15 or 20 bucks whatever that feeds you but it also makes it more enjoyable to watch the games when somebody wins a gold medal isnt that worth 20 bucks in enjoyment
4719910 we complain that we shouldnt spend money on sports but then we complain that we havent done well in sports and its because we havent spent the money
4719911 when silken laumann marnie mcbean and derek porter performed so well many of our kids were inspired by their success and took up rowing
4719912 some of those kids made it to the olympics others didnt
4719913 but every one of those kids benefited from learning dedication hard work teamwork and is a better person because of it
4719914 we need to put resouces into our olympians being a connected p r arm of health and welfare make it cool and desired to be fit
4719915 the medals will be a byproduct our marketing arm otherwise we spend more and more dollars on sick people both young and old
4719916 kids are going to be diving into the swimming pool and trying to do the breaststroke or figure out the butterfly running and jumping in parks fencing with anything they could find
4719917 my friend was camping with her daughter and she was in the water saying look mommy im rowing im not saying shes going to row at the olympics it is more than that its an inspiration from top to bottom
4719918 i think we need to keep supporting these athletes not just next week but the next four years in terms of giving the support thats required if we want to beat the world
4719919 otherwise dont come here and expect that all of a sudden for two weeks were going to beat the world when theres an amazing amount of support put out there financially by other nations we cant stop weve got to keep running
4719920 sport organizations are often the last refuge of the incompetent
4719921 i have read many of margaret atwoods books and im proud of her accomplishments but ive never jumped up and down on a couch when i heard margaret atwood wrote another book or michael ondaatje won a great literary award
4719922 i think weve moved forward to a time that the governor general also should have a sport award in the same way they honour arts and literature
4719923 i guess it goes to selling the message why sport is important
4719924 i just think its such an intricate part of society i look at my kids coming back from a workout and i see the jubiliation and feel the optimism that they have
4719925 maybe we need to spread that message more clearly promote the benefits of sport to society as well some countries understand it but i think canada sometimes grapples with it theres a perception that youre just funding the elite a small percentage but i think it benefits the whole society
4719926 but its a different story with summer athletes right now
4719927 i see it because i used to be a cyclist i know what its like
4719928 there is a lot of sponsorship money going into vanoc vancouver organizing committeee and into the coc right now but theres a void theres not money going into the athletes pocket
4719929 its a way of connecting to an olympic athletes journey
4719930 its an amazing ride ive brought people along on the ride many times it really is something special i think thats a part that is really missing in canada
4719931 the only real frustration anyone has is a lot of the negativity especially the negativity from the athletes of the past
4719932 youd think that theyd kind of contribute to some positive energy so we can maybe bring back some of the success they had back in the day but it seems like all they have to say is negative stuff
4719933 especially heading into a games here from athletes in the past im not saying any names but they know who they are
4719934 i dont see why they would wait until a time like this to let something like that out
4719935 thats more pressure and im old enough to be able to handle it
4719936 the pool is warm the air is cold they take a shower to keep their muscles loose for the next dive
4719937 theyre a great team the defending world champions and were looking forward to seeing what were made of
4719938 i expect great ball movement great execution and a smart team a very intelligent team so were really going to have to study them evaluate them and try to pick them apart
4719939 weve been through a lot of battles together we need to see if we can exploit our strengths and then well have a good chance
4719940 cant he just tell them how great they are and leave it at that
4719941 what happened in the last three that took you out of it
4719942 its all about managing failure ive played 16 years professionally and if i couldnt handle failure id be somewhere else
4719943 just imagine you are up the mountains you are in the middle of nowhere youre running and some places you have to hide
4719944 it was a big risk we took it was the biggest risk we took in our life and when i look back we could have got killed at the turkish border they were shooting at us
4719945 this was my last try whatever i had i put it on the line it was the right time to win i had worked my whole life for that few seconds
4719946 if you want it done and to get it done right get saeed and he will do it
4719947 i know he was doing a bathroom job in the lead up to the games
4719948 i wasnt too happy about it but what am i going to do saeed cant say no to anybody
4719949 to leave your country and your family without saying goodbye ive said to him are you not regretting it he says no he loves canada he wouldnt change a thing youve got to be pretty damn determined to do that determined to make yourself a better life and thats what hes doing
4719950 there are a million chinese women weightlifters in canada we have a couple of hundred theyve got a great great system and a feeder program weve heard a lot about
4719951 yeah we all want gold thats what you dream about when youre 8 years old we all imagine ourselves on the podium with the flag going up but it doesnt always happen that way
4719952 thats definitely the stiffest competition ive ever been in said lassen who celebrates the home fans by crossing her middle fingers to make a w which stands for whitehorse
4719953 was way crazier i was actually thinking of those fans back home and tried to draw on that support
4719954 i dont want to fight im happy with what i got
4719955 for years i know people are going to come up to me and say you won that race but this is what the electronic results show
4719956 if we got to do this again i would win it
4719957 a big high against china and six outs way from even a higher high against the u s but at the same time thats ball
4719958 this team came in focused theyve put a lot of work into these games they know what theyre here for and they know what were up against
4719959 she delivered pitches so we could get one touch of the ball outs and thats a veteran for you thats somebody really digging deep at that moment
4719960 shes an olympian and thats the type of response youd expect out of an olympian
4719961 i had the opportunity to experience what right to play does first hand when i visited liberia in 2007
4719962 having beaten the best in the world and going for gold its an incredible scenario
4719963 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4719964 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4719965 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4719966 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4719967 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4719968 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4719969 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4719970 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
